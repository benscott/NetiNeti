L. granatensis---The latter species contained two main mtDNA lineages, one on the branch leading to L. castroviejoi and the other on that leading to L. granatensis.
L. europaeus---The separation of these two lineages from the L. castroviejoi or L. granatensis lineages appears to be much older than the first paleontological record of L. europaeus in the Iberian peninsula.
L. granatensis---The separation of these two lineages from the L. castroviejoi or L. granatensis lineages appears to be much older than the first paleontological record of L. europaeus in the Iberian peninsula.
L. europaeus---This suggests that the apparent polyphyly of L. europaeus is due not to secondary introgression, but to the retention of ancestral polymorphism in L. europaeus.
L. europaeus---The results suggest that L. europaeus either has evolved as a very large population for a long time or has been fractionated.

B. microplus---The reproductive biology and nonparasitic development of Boophilus microplus (Canestrini) and hybridized Boophilus ticks (B. annulatus (Say) male x B. microplus female) held under natural field conditions in south Texas throughout the year were compared.
B. microplus---Comparisons between the two types of ticks indicated that the ovipositional biology (percentage of ovipositing females and number of eggs laid) of the females favored hybrid ticks during some months and B. microplus ticks during other months.
B. microplus---However, on a year long basis, there was virtually no difference in the percentage of ovipositing females or in the number of eggs deposited by hybrid females as compared to B. microplus.
B. microplus---On the other hand, egg hatchability of hybrid ticks was consistently lower than pure-strain B. microplus throughout the year with significantly lower hatch rates occurring in April, July, August, October, and November.
B. microplus---Thus, results obtained on percentage of ovipositing females, number of eggs laid, preoviposition period, incubation period of eggs, and larval longevity provide encouragement for the possible use of sterile hybrid males as a means of eliminating a native B. microplus population.
B. microplus---In contrast, results of the egg hatchability of the two types of ticks indicate that the selective advantage afforded to B. microplus could have an adverse affect on the success of a sterile hybrid male program by making the number of hybrid ticks necessary to eliminate a native population prohibitively high.

A. naeslundii---Freshly isolated fibrillar strains coaggregated consistently well with A. viscosus and A. naeslundii, although some fibrillar reference strains lacked the ability.
A. viscosus---Freshly isolated fibrillar strains coaggregated consistently well with A. viscosus and A. naeslundii, although some fibrillar reference strains lacked the ability.
F. nucleatum---Coaggregation with F. nucleatum was very strong for the fibrillar strains, but less strong for the tufted strains.
Treponema pallidum---Mucoid fluid accumulating within syphilitic lesions has been considered to be of Treponema pallidum origin.
T. pallidum---To test this assumption, we examined testicular exudative fluids from T. pallidum-infected rabbits for the presence of T. pallidum antigens by various sensitive immunochemical methods, including Western blot analysis.
T. pallidum---The possible mechanism by which mucopolysaccharides protect T. pallidum from immune mechanisms and its potential relationship to the pathogenesis of the disease are discussed.
Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans---Activation of rat B lymphocytes by Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans---We examined the lymphoproliferative responses of cervical lymphocytes and splenocytes of homozygous (rnu/rnu) congenitally athymic nude and normal heterozygous (rnu/+) Rowett rats to whole cells of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, a suspected periodontal disease pathogen.
A. actinomycetemcomitans---Previously sensitized cells from immunized only, infected only, or immunized and infected, normal rats demonstrated proliferation in response to formalinized A. actinomycetemcomitans, but cells from nude rats did not proliferate.
A. actinomycetemcomitans---A. actinomycetemcomitans caused cervical lymphocytes and splenocytes from untreated naive normal and nude rats to undergo increased DNA synthesis at day 2 of culture.
A. actinomycetemcomitans---Highly enriched nonsensitized spleen T cells prepared on a nylon wool column did not respond to A. actinomycetemcomitans, whereas enriched nonsensitized B cells proliferated.
A. actinomycetemcomitans---T-cell reconstitution of nude rats with neonatal thymus cells from rnu/+rats resulted in partial recovery of T-cell function but had no effect on the mitogenic response to A. actinomycetemcomitans.
A. actinomycetemcomitans---It is suggested that the antigenic responses to A. actinomycetemcomitans are dependent on T cells and that A. actinomycetemcomitans cells have mitogenic activity for B cells.
A. viscosus---There were also significant inverse correlations between the levels of salivary and serum antibody and the levels of implantation of A. viscosus T6.
A. viscosus---The level of implantation of A. viscosus T6 was significantly lower in the immunized animals than in the controls.
Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans---Monoclonal antibodies to leukotoxin of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans---Hybridoma cell lines which produce monoclonal antibodies to a leukotoxin from Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were prepared.
A. actinomycetemcomitans---Immunoblot analysis with the monoclonal antibodies also demonstrated that the leukotoxin was present in eight oral strains of A. actinomycetemcomitans that had been previously classified by a biological assay as leukotoxic.
A. actinomycetemcomitans---The availability of these monoclonal antibodies should facilitate and expand studies concerning the role of the leukotoxin in the pathogenicity of A. actinomycetemcomitans.
Bifidobacterium bifidum---Binding of the lipoteichoic acids of Bifidobacterium bifidum to human colonic epithelial cells appeared to be specific, reversible, and cell concentration and time dependent.
A. viscosus---The specificity requirements for the binding of Actinomyces viscosus T14V were examined by testing simple sugars, oligopeptides, and glycoproteins as inhibitors of the aggregation of glycoprotein-coated latex beads and washed A. viscosus cells.
A. viscosus---Thus, galactose beta-1----3 linked to N-acetylgalactosamine exhibits greater specificity for the A. viscosus lectin than does galactose beta-1----4 linked to N-acetylglucosamine.

B. subtilis---146, 430-432) was screened by an immunological procedure for DNA sequences encoding aspartokinase II of B. subtilis, an enzyme composed of two nonidentical subunits arranged in an alpha 2 beta 2 structure (Moir, D., and Paulus, H. (1977a) J. Biol.
B. subtilis---A recombinant bacteriophage was identified that harbored an 18-kilobase B. subtilis DNA fragment containing the coding sequences for both aspartokinase subunits.
B. subtilis---In response to transformation with the recombinant plasmids, Escherichia coli produced two polypeptides immunologically related to B. subtilis aspartokinase II with molecular weights (43,000 and 17,000) indistinguishable from those found in enzyme produced in B. subtilis.
B. subtilis---Peptide mapping by partial proteolysis confirmed the identity of the polypeptides produced by the transformed E. coli cells with the B. subtilis aspartokinase II subunits.
B. subtilis---The size of the cloned B. subtilis DNA fragment could be reduced to 2.9 kilobases by cleavage with PstI restriction endonuclease without affecting its ability to direct the synthesis of complete aspartokinase II subunits, irrespective of its orientation in the plasmid vector.
B. subtilis---A map of the gene for B. subtilis aspartokinase II is proposed in which the coding sequence for the smaller beta subunit overlaps in the same reading frame the promoter-distal portion of the coding sequence for the alpha subunit.
B. subtilis---The gene coding for the subunits of aspartokinase II from Bacillus subtilis has been identified in a B. subtilis DNA library and cloned in a bacterial plasmid (Bondaryk, R. P., and Paulus, H. (1984) J. Biol.
B. subtilis---The B. subtilis aspartokinase gene could thus be functionally expressed in E. coli and substitute for the E. coli aspartokinases.
B. subtilis---Measurement of aspartokinase levels in extracts of aspartokinaseless E. coli transformed with the B. subtilis aspartokinase II gene revealed an enzyme level comparable to that in a genetically derepressed B. subtilis strain.
B. subtilis---This apparently paradoxical sensitivity to lysine was due to the allosteric inhibition of B. subtilis aspartokinase II by that amino acid, a property which was also observed in extracts of the transformed E. coli strain.
B. subtilis---The synthesis and degradation of the aspartokinase II subunits were measured by labeling experiments in E. coli transformed with the B. subtilis aspartokinase II gene.
B. subtilis---In contrast to exponentially growing cells of B. subtilis which contained equimolar amounts of the aspartokinase alpha and beta subunits, the transformed E. coli strain contained a 3-fold molar excess of beta subunit.
B. subtilis---In conjunction with the results described in the preceding paper which demonstrated that the aspartokinase subunits are encoded by a single DNA sequence, these observations imply that the alpha and beta subunits of B. subtilis aspartokinase II are the products of in-phase overlapping genes.
S. faecalis---Thus, the cytoplasmic pH is regulated only by the cytoplasmic alkalization, and there is no regulation at alkaline pH in S. faecalis.
S. faecalis---I conclude that in S. faecalis, the cytoplasmic pH is regulated by H+-ATPase.
Melanoplus differentialis---We extracted chromosomes by micromanipulation from Melanoplus differentialis spermatocytes, producing metaphase spindles with only one or a few chromosomes instead of the usual complement of 23.
S. purpuratus---We prepared antibodies to this set of proteins to localize them in the doublet microtubules of S. purpuratus and other species.
Chlorogonium elongatum---Basal bodies and associated structures are not required for normal flagellar motion or phototaxis in the green alga Chlorogonium elongatum.
Chlorogonium elongatum---The interphase flagellar apparatus of the green alga Chlorogonium elongatum resembles that of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in the possession of microtubular rootlets and striated fibers.
Amblyomma americanum---In the current study, actively sensitized guinea pigs treated three times daily with H-1 (mepyramine) and H-2 (cimetidine) histamine receptor antagonists, during the challenge tick infestation period, expressed normal resistance to Amblyomma americanum larvae.
A. americanum---Similarly, naive guinea pigs treated with anti-histamines four times daily, beginning 7 days before transfer of immune serum and tick challenge and continuing through the tick infestation period, also expressed normal antibody-mediated resistance to A. americanum.
A. americanum---These results indicate that local recruitment and subsequent degranulation of basophils via immune mechanisms dependent on non-tick antigens can lead to tick rejection, and that basophil-derived mediators other than histamine are involved in this immune resistance response to A. americanum ticks.
Dipetalonema reconditum---Parasite antigens were detected in 45 of 46 sera from infected dogs but were absent in sera from uninfected dogs and sera from dogs infected with Dipetalonema reconditum.
C. parvum---injection of Propionibacterium acnes (formerly designated C. parvum) also demonstrated a decreased accumulation of 28S comparable with that observed in in vitro-activated macrophages.
Bacterionema matruchotii---Butanol-extracted water soluble adjuvant (Bu-WSA) obtained from Bacterionema matruchotii was not mitogenic for human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBM) but was capable of enhancing (3H) thymidine uptake of T cells stimulated by concanavalin A (Con A) in the presence of B cells or macrophages (M phi) in vitro.
Peptostreptococcus anaerobius---Light-activated Hpd was 99.9% bactericidal against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacteroides fragilis, Streptococcus M-G intermedius, Streptococcus mutans, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Peptococcus magnus, and Clostridium perfringens, but did not affect Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or Candida albicans.
Legionella pneumophila---Defective triggering of polymorphonuclear leukocyte oxidative metabolism by Legionella pneumophila toxin.
Legionella pneumophila---Preincubation of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNLs) with Legionella pneumophila toxin impaired activation of the superoxide-generating complex induced by latex particles and by the Ca++ ionophore A23187.
Legionella pneumophila---These observations indicate that Legionella pneumophila toxin selectively impairs activation of the phagocyte superoxide-generating complex without affecting the functional integrity of components of the complex.
B. dermatitidis---This greater efficiency of phagocytosis and growth inhibition of B. dermatitidis reflects another mechanism of human cellular immunity to this fungal infection.
Corynebacterium parvum---administration of Corynebacterium parvum.
Corynebacterium parvum---After 4 hours incubation Corynebacterium parvum was an effective stimulant for mononuclear leukocytes, behaving in the same way as the typical gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli, whereas mononuclear cells incubated with Staphylococcus aureus were not affected.
Corynebacterium parvum---Corynebacterium parvum used was found devoid of endotoxin by the Limulus assay and was not affected by Polymyxin B, which, on the contrary, inhibited Escherichia coli-induced production of procoagulant activity.
Corynebacterium parvum---Intact Corynebacterium parvum may be required for the production of procoagulant activity and, although this specific aspect of the research will require further study, from the exposed data it is concluded that such a production could be a factor contributing to the pathogenesis of the coagulopathy following Corynebacterium parvum therapy.

R. capsulata---We report that the light-harvesting and reaction center genes in the rxcA locus of R. capsulata are contained within a single operon and that their differential expression results predominantly from marked segmental differences in stability within the polycistronic rxcA transcript.
R. capsulata---When a DNA fragment containing the rxcA locus was fused to a plasmid promoter and transcribed in E. coli, the long precursor transcript was processed to two short messages of greater stability, as in R. capsulata.
Corynebacterium parvum---In most instances optimal CA was observed 6 hr after administration of adjuvant and varied from 3.7 (methylamine) to 50 (Corynebacterium parvum strain 4982) units.

C. albicans---Some non-C. albicans isolates produced proteinase; however, the amount of activity was generally less than for C. albicans.
M. kansasii---Use of the BACTEC system for drug susceptibility testing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, M. kansasii, and M. avium complex.
M. kansasii---A total of 199 Mycobacterium tuberculosis, 182 M. kansasii, and 32 M. avium complex isolates were tested for susceptibility to either three or 10 color-coded drugs in a four-phase study using the conventional 7H10 plate method and the BACTEC system.
M. kansasii---M. kansasii data were encouraging, with 88.9% drug agreement against 10 drugs, but M. avium complex agreement was only 51.6% against 10.
M. kansasii---Average time required for reportable results was 4.8 days for M. tuberculosis, 4.3 days for M. kansasii, and 3.4 days for M. avium complex.
Acinetobacter anitratus---Four isolates, two Acinetobacter anitratus, one Serratia marcescens and one Moraxella osloensis could not be identified by IDX.

Corynebacterium parvum---Female BALB/c and C3H/HeJ mice develop increased sensitivity to the toxic effects of indomethacin after injection of nonviable Corynebacterium parvum.
C. parvum---The pyridine extract residue of C. parvum was as effective as C. parvum whole cells in inducing indomethacin and LPS sensitivity.
S. faecalis---Again, no plasmid DNA was detectable in transconjugants, and the latter could donate tetracycline resistance to S. faecalis, S. sanguis, and Streptococcus lactis.
S. faecalis---The tetracycline resistance element was able to transpose to several sites on the S. faecalis hemolysin plasmid pAD1 and in each case resulted in a 15-kilobase insert.
Capnocytophaga gingivalis---Lysozyme-mediated aggregation and lysis of the periodontal microorganism Capnocytophaga gingivalis 2010.
Capnocytophaga gingivalis---The ability of lysozyme to aggregate and lyse the gram-negative capnophilic periodontal microorganism Capnocytophaga gingivalis 2010 was monitored optically at 540 nm.
C. gingivalis---In effect, the cationic enzyme lysed C. gingivalis 2010, which was not apparent in the spectrophotometric assay.
C. albicans---These results suggest that, given this mucosally pathogenic strain of C. albicans, the establishment of a chronic infection of the rat tongue is apparently not influenced by tetracycline-treated drinking water as administered in this study.
A. viscosus---Cross-reactions were also observed with the LDHs from A. viscosus and L. casei, the latter being the least related.
Lactobacillus leichmannii---A very weak immunological relationship was obtained between the L-LDH from S. mutans OMZ175 and the D-LDH from Lactobacillus leichmannii, whereas no cross-reaction could be detected with mammal LDHs.
P. carinii---ICR and DDD mice were intranasally infected with 10(4) mouse lung-derived P. carinii, and the delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction and antibody titers to P. carinii were measured along with the number of P. carinii cysts in the lungs after infection.
P. carinii---The number of P. carinii cysts in the lungs peaked at 2 weeks after infection and then decreased to barely detectable levels by 4 weeks.
P. carinii---Thus, the decline in the number of P. carinii cysts in the lungs corresponded well with the time of the peak of the DTH reaction but not with the serum antibody response.
P. carinii---Spleen T cells from infected mice mediated the DTH reaction when transferred intravenously into normal recipients and reduced the number of P. carinii cysts in the lungs when transferred intravenously into P. carinii-infected mice.
P. carinii---The results indicated that cellular immunity is important for protection from subclinical P. carinii infections.
Yersinia pseudotuberculosis---Temperature-inducible surface fibrillae associated with the virulence plasmid of Yersinia enterocolitica and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis.
Yersinia pseudotuberculosis---When cultivated at 37 degrees C in static broth, human clinical isolates of Yersinia enterocolitica (serogroups O:3, O:8, and O:9) and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis (serogroup O:III) produced numerous nonflagellar surface appendages, which appeared as a lawn of fine fibrillae, each having a diameter of 1.5 to 2.0 nm and a length of 50 to 70 nm.
B. abortus---Brucella abortus lipopolysaccharide was tested in a blastogenesis assay with unfractionated and nylon wool-separated peripheral blood lymphocytes of Brucella-naive cattle and cattle immunized with B. abortus.

P. judaica---Implication of charged sugar residues in the wide distribution of P. judaica allergens in a pH gradient is discussed.
Corynebacterium parvum---Inflammatory neutrophils elicited by intraperitoneal injection of Corynebacterium parvum, thioglycollate or proteose peptone were capable of lysing different murine and human tumor targets in a short-term chromium-release assay.
C. parvum---Optimal lysis was achieved by PMNs obtained 6 hr after injection of C. parvum and 16 hr after injection of thioglycollate.
M. marinum---Although M. marinum organisms multiplied in greater numbers in the TLI mice, ultimately they were destroyed as effectively in TLI mice as in the non-irradiated control mice.
M. marinum---Mice previously challenged with M. marinum in one hind foot pad, and challenged subsequently with the same organism in the opposite hind foot pad, showed a solid immunity against this reinfection.
M. marinum---It appears that upon recovery from the immediate effects of radiotherapy TLI-treated mice are able to mount an effective immune response to experimental infection with M. marinum and M. leprae.
Peromyscus maniculatus---Consequently, P50 at pH 7.4, PCO2(7.4), the CO2 Bohr effect, and the buffer slope (delta log PCO2/delta pH) were determined via the mixing technique in Peromyscus maniculatus native to a range of altitudes but acclimated to 340 or 3,800 m. PCO2(7.4) and buffer slope were substantially lower at high altitude.
Stigmatella aurantiaca---Cohesion in the myxobacterium Stigmatella aurantiaca was characterized.
S. aurantiaca---We conclude that S. aurantiaca responds to calcium ion by synthesizing the molecular components of a system of cell cohesion (class B) and that the functioning of this system requires the expenditure of metabolic energy.
Spiroplasma floricola---The positional distribution of the fatty acids in phosphatidylglycerol of Spiroplasma floricola resembled that found in Mycoplasma species, in which the saturated fatty acids prefer position 2 in the glycerol backbone and not position 1 as found in Acholeplasma species and elsewhere in nature.
Acholeplasma laidlawii---The S. floricola membranes were more rigid than those of Acholeplasma laidlawii and less rigid than those of Mycoplasma gallisepticum.
A. tumefaciens---The A. tumefaciens and R. trifolii transconjugants were unable to elicit curling of alfalfa root hairs, but were able to induce nodule development at a low frequency.
R. trifolii transconjugants---The A. tumefaciens and R. trifolii transconjugants were unable to elicit curling of alfalfa root hairs, but were able to induce nodule development at a low frequency.
A. tumefaciens---Thus, alfalfa nodules induced by A. tumefaciens and R. trifolii transconjugants carrying small nodulation clones of R. meliloti were completely devoid of intracellular bacteria.
R. trifolii transconjugants---Thus, alfalfa nodules induced by A. tumefaciens and R. trifolii transconjugants carrying small nodulation clones of R. meliloti were completely devoid of intracellular bacteria.
A. tumefaciens---The genes encoded in the 8.7-kilobase nodulation fragment are sufficient in A. tumefaciens or R. trifolii backgrounds for nodule morphogenesis.
Thermoplasma acidophilum---Generation of a large, protonophore-sensitive proton motive force and pH difference in the acidophilic bacteria Thermoplasma acidophilum and Bacillus acidocaldarius.
Thermoplasma acidophilum---For this purpose we determined the components of proton motive force in the eubacterium Bacillus acidocaldarius and the archaebacterium Thermoplasma acidophilum.
B. subtilis---The Smith degradation of reduced samples of the teichoic acid-linked saccharide preparations from S. aureus and B. subtilis gave fragments characterized as 1,2-ethylenediol phosphate-(glycerolphosphate)3-N-acetylmannosaminyl beta(1----4)N- -acetylxylosaminitol and 1,2-ethylenediolphosphate-(glycerol phosphate)2-N-acetylmannosaminyl beta(1----4)N-acetylxylosaminitol, respectively.
B. subtilis---Thus, it is concluded that the ribitol teichoic acid chains in the cell walls of the strains of S. aureus and B. subtilis are linked to peptidoglycan through linkage units, (glycerol phosphate)3-N-acetylmannosaminyl beta(1----4)N-acetylglucosamine and (glycerol phosphate)2-N-acetylmannosaminyl beta(1----4)N-acetylglucosamine, respectively.
B. megaterium---The first Bacillus subtilis small, acid-soluble spore protein (SASP) gene has been cloned by using previously cloned B. megaterium SASP genes as DNA-DNA hybridization probes.
B. subtilis---Determination of the DNA sequence of the B. subtilis SASP gene showed that it codes for a 72-residue protein (termed SASP-1) containing a single spore protease cleavage site as well as other sequences conserved in Bacillus megaterium SASPs A, C, C-1, C-2, and C-3.
B. subtilis---The B. subtilis SASP-1 genes's coding sequence is preceded by a potential Bacillus ribosome-binding site, and is followed by a sequence that could form a stem-and-loop structure characteristic of transcription termination sites.
B. megaterium---Upstream from the coding sequence there are no obvious homologies with other B. subtilis sporulation genes, but similarities with B. megaterium SASP genes are evident.
B. subtilis---Upstream from the coding sequence there are no obvious homologies with other B. subtilis sporulation genes, but similarities with B. megaterium SASP genes are evident.
B. subtilis---The cloned SASP-1 gene hybridizes to three bands other than the SASP-1 gene itself in EcoRI or HindIII digests of B. subtilis DNA.
B. subtilis---Presumably these other bands represent SASP genes related to the SASP-1 gene, and we have been able to detect at least three such proteins in B. subtilis spores.

L. pneumophila---Genetic exchange mechanisms, to our knowledge, have not been reported for Legionella pneumophila, and consequently, studies on the genetic organization of L. pneumophila have not appeared in the literature.
Legionella pneumophila---Genetic exchange mechanisms, to our knowledge, have not been reported for Legionella pneumophila, and consequently, studies on the genetic organization of L. pneumophila have not appeared in the literature.
L. pneumophila---Escherichia coli strains carrying plasmids RP1 and R68.45 (IncP1), S-a (IncW), and R40a (IncC), but not plasmids of incompatibility groups FI, FII, and FV, served as donors in matings with L. pneumophila Knoxville 1 (LPK-1).
L. pneumophila---Recombinational exchange of a chromosomal trait was demonstrated when a thymidine auxotroph of L. pneumophila was repaired by R68.45-mediated chromosomal mobilization of a prototrophic donor strain.
B. subtilis---CAT levels in B. subtilis carrying the ctc/CAT fusion plasmid varied in a manner that was consistent with the known pattern of ctc RNA synthesis.
B. subtilis---Several of the B. subtilis mutants, both CAT overproducers and underproducers, also had acquired a sporulation-deficient phenotype.
B. subtilis---Analysis of RNA synthesized by mutant cells indicates that at least a portion of the mutants may be altered in the level of transcription from the ctc promoter and, hence, are likely to define B. subtilis genes which influence this process.
B. subtilis---The carboxy-terminal half of the precursor is a presumptive glucoamylase which contains several peptide segments showing a high degree of homology with alpha-amylases from widely diverse organisms including a procaryote (B. subtilis) and eucaryotes (Aspergillus oryzae and mouse).
S. diastaticus---Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA from S. diastaticus and a glucoamylase-non-secreting yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, revealed that the STA1 and STA3 loci of S. diastaticus showed a high degree of homology, and that both yeast species (S. diastaticus and S. cerevisiae) contained DNA segments highly homologous to those of the extracellular glucoamylase genes.
S. diastaticus---Restriction maps of the homologous DNA segments suggested that the extracellular glucoamylase genes of S. diastaticus may have arisen from recombination among the resident DNA segments in S. cerevisiae.
B. subtilis---A membrane-bound DNA sequence from Bacillus subtilis was subcloned into a plasmid which can replicate in Escherichia coli but not in B. subtilis.
B. subtilis---The plasmid integrated into the B. subtilis chromosome at the region of homology, conferring chloramphenicol resistance on the recipient.
B. subtilis---If this proposal were correct, B. subtilis mutants containing chloramphenicol-insensitive ribosomes should not permit chloramphenicol induction of either cat-86 or pC194 cat.
B. subtilis---However, we and others have been unable to isolate chloramphenicol-resistant ribosomal mutants of B. subtilis 168.
B. subtilis---Amicetin-resistant mutants of B. subtilis were readily isolated, and in none of six mutants tested was cat-86 detectably inducible by amicetin, although the chloramphenicol-inducible phenotype was retained.

B. cereus---Sequencing of [35S]Met-labeled pre-beta-lactamase I from phenylethyl alcohol-treated cells of B. cereus 569/H indicated that UUG is being utilized as the initiation codon for penPC.
B. cereus---The same result was obtained for the pre-beta-lactamase I from similarly treated cells of the closely related B. cereus 5/B strain.
Photobacterium phosphoreum---The acyl protein synthetase component (50K) of the fatty acid reductase complex from the luminescent system of Photobacterium phosphoreum has been found to catalyze the activation of fatty acid via formation of an enzyme bound acyl-AMP (carboxyphosphate mixed anhydride) immediately prior to the acylation of the enzyme.

P. mirabilis---A group of faecal isolates of Proteus vulgaris and P. mirabilis was studied for the presence of possible virulence factors such as growth rates in urine and broth, haemolysin production, hydrophobicity, sensitivity to the bactericidal activity of human serum and cell invasiveness.
P. mirabilis---These differences might explain why P. mirabilis is much more common in human urinary-tract infections than P. vulgaris.

Schistosoma mekongi---Schistosomiasis in Southeast Asia, caused by Schistosoma japonicum, Schistosoma mekongi and Schistosoma japonicum-like, have been reported from six different countries.
P. mirabilis---The following have been demonstrated: With a standardized model of P. mirabilis peritonitis in ICR mice, when optimal doses of an aminoglycoside antibiotic (kanamycin) are given so as to reduce mortality maximally, abrupt and significant increments occur in endotoxemia, which cannot be attributed to impairment of clearance of endotoxin.
P. mirabilis---MP, although unable to reduce mortality from P. mirabilis peritonitis in the absence of antibiotic therapy, does so when endotoxin is added to the challenge inoculum.
P. mirabilis---It is concluded from these observations that aminoglycoside antibiotic treatment can shift the lethal mechanisms during P. mirabilis peritonitis from those involving bacterial proliferation and low levels of endotoxemia to those involving bacterial death and release of large amounts of endotoxin.
P. mirabilis---Finally, since animals surviving after antibiotic treatment have significantly greater endotoxemia than those dying without such treatment and since MP does not reduce mortality in the absence of antibiotic therapy but does so if endotoxin is added to the challenge inoculum, it appears that endotoxin may not play a critical role in the pathogenesis of mortality from untreated P. mirabilis peritonitis.

A. praelongus---However, A. praelongus (30 microg/ml) venom initiated a significant direct contracture of muscle, indicative of some myotoxic activity.
A. antarcticus---The prior (10 min) administration of death adder antivenom (1 unit/ml), which is raised against A. antarcticus venom, markedly attenuated the twitch blockade produced by all venoms (10 microg/ml).
A. antarcticus---Administration of antivenom (1.5 units/ml) at t(90) markedly reversed, over a period of 4 h, the inhibition of twitches produced by A. praelongus (3 microg/ml, 72+/-6% recovery) and A. pyrrhus (3 microg/ml, 51+/-9% recovery) but was less effective against A. antarcticus venom (3 microg/ml, 22+/-7% recovery).

Gymnapistes marmoratus---Cardiovascular studies on venom from the soldierfish (Gymnapistes marmoratus).
G. marmoratus---The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of Synanceia antivenom in neutralising the in vitro and in vivo cardiovascular activity of G. marmoratus venom.
G. marmoratus---In rat paced (5 ms, 2 Hz, 7-12 V) left atria, G. marmoratus venom extract (40 microg protein/ml) produced a transient negative, followed by a sustained positive inotropic response.
G. marmoratus---As Synanceia antivenom neutralised the cardiovascular activity of G. marmoratus venom both in vitro and in vivo, we suggest that the venoms of the two species may share a similar component(s).
B. lanceolatus---We have investigated the coagulant and anticoagulant actions of B. lanceolatus venom on human citrated plasma and on purified plasma components.
B. lanceolatus---Although B. lanceolatus venom up to 50 microg/ml was unable to clot citrated plasma, at concentrations > or = 5 microg/ml the venom dose-dependently clotted purified human fibrinogen, indicating the presence of a thrombin-like enzyme.
B. lanceolatus---To investigate this possibility, B. lanceolatus venom was incubated with different plasma protease inhibitors and the activity on fibrinogen tested.
B. lanceolatus---A non-toxic, acidic phospholipase A(2) purified from B. lanceolatus venom prolonged the activated partial thromboplastin time in human plasma from 39.7+/-0.5 s (control with saline) to 60.2+/-0.9 s with 50 microg of PLA(2) (p&lt;0.001), suggesting an anticoagulant activity associated with this enzyme.

A. suum---Despite a deeper understanding of the immune response of a variety of hosts to infections with either A. lumbricoides or A. suum there is at present little prospect of an effective vaccine against ascariasis.
A. suum---The relationship between A. lumbricoides and A. suum is addressed, particularly since both species, if they are indeed separate species, occur in people and their pigs in many communities.
Mytilus galloprovincialis---Comparison of pectenotoxin (PTX) profiles of toxic dinoflagellate Dinophysis acuta, Greenshell mussels (Perna canaliculus) and Blue mussels (Mytilus galloprovincialis) collected from Wedge Point, Queen Charlotte Sound, New Zealand was carried out by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry with turbo-ionspray ionization.

B. thuringiensis---An aprA1 strain of B. thuringiensis that contained the wild-type gene for neutral protease A (nprA(+)) displayed levels of extracellular proteolytic activity that were similar to those of an aprA(+)nprA(+) strain.
B. thuringiensis---These results suggest that enhanced yield of certain crystal proteins can be obtained by deletion of the genes aprA and nprA which are the major extracellular proteases of B. thuringiensis.
Puumala hantavirus---DNA vaccination of mice with a plasmid encoding Puumala hantavirus nucleocapsid protein mimics the B-cell response induced by virus infection.
Puumala hantavirus---To study the humoral immune response induced by DNA vaccination we cloned the entire nucleocapsid protein-encoding sequence of the Puumala hantavirus strain Vranica/Hällnäs into the CMV promoter-driven expression unit of the plasmid pcDNA3, generating pcDNA3-VR1.

T. serrulatus---Here, we have sought evidence for a direct action of T. serrulatus venom on the isolated rat heart (Langendorff's method).
T. serrulatus---We show that the bradycardia induced by T. serrulatus venom was completely blocked by atropine, a muscarinic receptor antagonist.
T. serrulatus---The results clearly demonstrate that the chronotropic effects of T. serrulatus are dependent on neurotransmitter release, but the inotropic effects are not.
T. serrulatus---We suggest that this direct effect on cardiac fibers may play a role in the development of cardiac arrhythmias and contractility defects following envenoming with T. serrulatus scorpion.
Methanococcus thermolithotrophicus---Switching osmolyte strategies: response of Methanococcus thermolithotrophicus to changes in external NaCl.
Methanococcus thermolithotrophicus---Methanococcus thermolithotrophicus, a thermophilic methanogenic archaeon, produces and accumulates beta-glutamate and L-alpha-glutamate as osmolytes when grown in media with &lt;1 M NaCl.

Phaseolus lunatus---When developed inside Vigna unguiculata (cowpea) seeds, fourth instar larvae have minor quantities of the slow-migrating forms, but when reared on seeds of Phaseolus vulgaris (common bean) or Phaseolus lunatus, the two slow-migrating forms are expressed in higher amounts, while activity of the major form was independent of the host seed.
Phaenicia sericata---To determine the pattern-orientation discrimination ability of blowflies, Phaenicia sericata, a learning/memory assay was developed in which sucrose served as the reward stimulus and was paired with one of two visual gratings of different orientations.
Phaenicia sericata---Blowflies, Phaenicia sericata, can be trained to discriminate in a learning paradigm in which one of the two visual cues is positively rewarded.
Phaenicia sericata---These data suggest that Phaenicia sericata can learn a visual pattern with one eye region and later recognize the same pattern with another eye region.

Chromobacterium viscosum---Chromobacterium viscosum lipase is taken as the example.
A. tumefaciens---Southern analysis suggests that the gene encoding this elongation factor is present as a single copy in A. tumefaciens.
C. albicans---Because a strain lacking both C. albicans SEC20 alleles could not be constructed, we placed SEC20 under transcriptional control of two regulatable promoters, MET3p and PCK1p.
C. albicans---These results demonstrate the occurrence and function of Sec20p in a fungal species other than S. cerevisiae, but the lack of the N-terminal domain and the apparent absence of a close TIP20 homolog in the C. albicans genome also indicate a considerable diversity in mechanisms of retrograde vesicle traffic in eukaryotes.
T. aquaticus---Currently, very little is known about T. aquaticus transcription and no genetic system to study T. aquaticus RNAP genes is available.
T. aquaticus---To overcome these limitations, we cloned and overexpressed T. aquaticus RNAP genes in Escherichia coli.
T. aquaticus---Overproduced T. aquaticus RNAP subunits assembled into functional RNAP in vitro and in vivo when coexpressed in E. coli.
T. aquaticus---We used the recombinant T. aquaticus enzyme to demonstrate that transcription initiation, transcription termination, and transcription cleavage assays developed for E. coli RNAP can be adapted to study T. aquaticus transcription.
T. aquaticus---However, T. aquaticus RNAP differs from the prototypical E. coli enzyme in several important ways: it terminates transcription less efficiently, has exceptionally high rate of intrinsic transcript cleavage, and is highly resistant to rifampin.

Clostridium cellulolyticum---The metabolic characteristics of Clostridium cellulolyticum, a mesophilic cellulolytic nonruminal bacterium, were investigated and characterized kinetically for the fermentation of cellulose by using chemostat culture analysis.
C. cellulolyticum---Since with C. cellulolyticum (i) the ATP/ADP ratio is lower than 1, (ii) the production of lactate at low specific growth rate (mu) is low, and (iii) there is a decrease of the NADH/NAD(+) ratio and q(NADH produced)/ q(NADH used) ratio as the dilution rate (D) increases in carbon-limited conditions, the chemostats used were cellulose-limited continuously fed cultures.
C. cellulolyticum---From these results, C. cellulolyticum appeared well adapted and even restricted to a cellulolytic lifestyle.
B. thermoglucosidasius---Renaturation trials revealed that the addition of DNA to purified B. thermoglucosidasius HrcA can result in solubilization of HrcA free from the denaturing agent urea.
B. thermoglucosidasius---Results from band shift and light scattering assays provided three new findings: (i) any species of DNA can serve to solubilize B. thermoglucosidasius HrcA, but DNA containing the CIRCE (controlling inverted repeat of chaperone expression) element is far more effective than other nonspecific DNA; (ii) B. thermoglucosidasius HrcA renatured with nonspecific DNA bound the CIRCE element in the molecular ratio of 2.6:1; and (iii) B. thermoglucosidasius HrcA binding to the CIRCE element was stable at below 50 degrees C whereas the complex was rapidly denatured at 70 degrees C, suggesting that the breakdown of HrcA is induced by heat stress and HrcA may act as a thermosensor to affect the expression of heat shock regulatory genes.

A. ambivalens---Kinetics of electron and proton transfer during O(2) reduction in cytochrome aa(3) from A. ambivalens: an enzyme lacking Glu(I-286).
Acidianus ambivalens---Acidianus ambivalens is a hyperthermoacidophilic archaeon which grows optimally at approximately 80 degrees C and pH 2.5.
A. ambivalens---In this study we have investigated the dynamics of the reaction of the reduced A. ambivalens quinol oxidase with O(2).
A. ambivalens---Moreover, the overall electron and proton-transfer kinetics in the A. ambivalens quinol oxidase are the same as those in the E. coli ubiquinol oxidase, which indicates that in the A. ambivalens enzyme a different pathway is used for proton transfer to the binuclear center and/or other protonatable groups in an equivalent pathway are involved.
A. ambivalens---Potential candidates in that pathway are two glutamates at positions (I-80) and (I-83) in the A. ambivalens enzyme (corresponding to Met(I-116) and Val(I-119), respectively, in E. coli cytochrome bo(3)).

Scenedesmus obliquus---The green alga Scenedesmus obliquus is capable of both uptake and production of H(2) after anaerobic adaptation (photoreduction of CO(2) or photohydrogen production).
Corynebacterium glutamicum---Purification from Corynebacterium glutamicum and analysis of the QcrCBA operon encoding three subunit proteins of a putative cytochrome reductase complex.
Corynebacterium glutamicum---Electrophoresis of a Corynebacterium glutamicum membrane preparation in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, followed by staining for peroxidase activity (heme staining), showed only one band at about 28 kDa.
C. glutamicum---This 28 kDa protein was purified from C. glutamicum membranes by chromatography in the presence of decylglucoside using DEAE-Toyopearl and hydroxylapatite columns, as the sole c-type cytochrome in the bacterium.
C. glutamicum---A QcrCAB operon encoding the subunits of a putative quinol cytochrome c reductase was found 3'-downstream of ctaE encoding subunit III of cytochrome aa(3) in the C. glutamicum genome.
C. glutamicum---QcrA and qcrB of C. glutamicum encode the Rieske Fe-S protein and cytochrome b, respectively, although these proteins were not co-purified with cytochrome cc.
C. glutamicum---The phylogenetic tree of cytochromes b and b(6) show that C. glutamicum cytochrome b, along with those of other bacteria in the high G+C group, is rather different from the Bacillus counterparts, but highly similar to the Deinococci and Thermus cytochromes.

Melopsittacus undulatus---Distribution of tyrosine hydroxylase-containing neurons and fibers in the brain of the budgerigar (Melopsittacus undulatus): general patterns and labeling in vocal control nuclei.
Melopsittacus undulatus---The distribution of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) was mapped out in cells and fibers of the budgerigar (Melopsittacus undulatus) brain.
Poephila guttata---These findings are in contrast to previous findings in zebra finch (Poephila guttata), a close ended vocal learning songbird in which TH staining in vocal nuclei increases during development and remains greater than surrounding fields throughout adulthood.
Gambierdiscus toxicus---Ciguatera poisoning is little known in temperate countries as a potentially global problem associated with human ingestion of large carnivorous fish that harbour the bioaccumulated ciguatoxins of the photosynthetic dinoflagellate Gambierdiscus toxicus.

Burkholderia thailandensis---Burkholderia thailandensis is a nonpathogenic environmental organism closely related to B. pseudomallei.
B. pseudomallei---Subtractive hybridization was carried out between these two species to identify genes encoding virulence determinants in B. pseudomallei.
B. pseudomallei---Screening of the subtraction library revealed A-T-rich DNA sequences unique to B. pseudomallei, suggesting they may have been acquired by horizontal transfer.
B. pseudomallei---This gene was insertionally inactivated in wild-type B. pseudomallei to create SR1015.
B. pseudomallei---The 50% lethal dose (LD(50)) for wild-type B. pseudomallei is &lt;10 CFU; the LD(50) for SR1015 was determined to be 3.5 x 10(5) CFU, similar to that of B. thailandensis (6.8 x 10(5) CFU).
B. thailandensis---The 50% lethal dose (LD(50)) for wild-type B. pseudomallei is &lt;10 CFU; the LD(50) for SR1015 was determined to be 3.5 x 10(5) CFU, similar to that of B. thailandensis (6.8 x 10(5) CFU).
B. stabilis---In addition, DNA from Burkholderia mallei and Burkholderia stabilis hybridized to a glycosyltransferase fragment probe, and a capsular structure was identified on the surface of B. stabilis via immunoelectron microscopy.
Burkholderia stabilis---In addition, DNA from Burkholderia mallei and Burkholderia stabilis hybridized to a glycosyltransferase fragment probe, and a capsular structure was identified on the surface of B. stabilis via immunoelectron microscopy.
B. pseudomallei---Thus, the combination of PCR-based subtractive hybridization, insertional inactivation, and animal virulence studies has facilitated the identification of an important virulence determinant in B. pseudomallei.

P. carinii---P. carinii f. sp. carinii infecting rats differentiated by karyotypic profiles exhibit the same low level of genetic divergence manifested by organisms infecting humans.
P. carinii---P. carinii f. sp. carinii karyotype forms 1, 2, and 6 were inoculated into immunosuppressed rats, individually and in dual combinations, spaced 0, 10, and 20 days apart.
P. carinii---These studies showed that the time between inoculations was critical in establishing coinfections and P. carinii f. sp. carinii karyotype profiles were associated with differences in biological responses.
C. albicans---We cloned and sequenced the IMH3(r) gene from C. albicans strain 1006, which was previously identified as resistant to mycophenolic acid (MPA) (A. K. Goshorn and S. Scherer, Genetics 123:213-218, 1989).
C. albicans---We used this gene as a dominant selectable marker in clinical isolates of C. albicans and Candida tropicalis.
C. albicans---In the present study, we have shown that there are no other LIG4 homologues in C. albicans.
C. albicans---However, our data show that the NHEJ apparatus of C. albicans may control morphogenesis in this diploid organism.
Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans---Cloning and expression of the Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans thioredoxin (trx) gene and assessment of cytokine inhibitory activity.
Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans---In spite of this evidence, it has been reported that the oral bacterium and periodontopathogen Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans secretes an immunosuppressive factor (termed suppressive factor 1 [SF1] [T. Kurita-Ochiai and K. Ochiai, Infect.
A. actinomycetemcomitans---We have cloned and expressed the gene encoding the thioredoxin of A. actinomycetemcomitans and have purified the protein to homogeneity.
A. actinomycetemcomitans---The A. actinomycetemcomitans trx gene has 52 and 76% identities, respectively, to the trx genes of Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae.
A. actinomycetemcomitans---We therefore conclude that the thioredoxin of A. actinomycetemcomitans does not act as an immunosuppressive factor, at least with human leukocytes in cultures, and that the identity of SF1 remains to be elucidated.

Legionella pneumophila---Legionella pneumophila major acid phosphatase and its role in intracellular infection.
Legionella pneumophila---Legionella pneumophila is an intracellular pathogen of protozoa and alveolar macrophages.
L. pneumophila---We previously demonstrated that the PilD prepilin peptidase is crucial for intracellular infection by L. pneumophila and that the secreted pilD-dependent proteins include a metalloprotease, an acid phosphatase, an esterase/lipase, a phospholipase A, and a p-nitrophenyl phosphorylcholine hydrolase.
L. pneumophila---Three mutants defective in acid phosphatase activity were isolated from a population of mini-Tn10-mutagenized L. pneumophila.
L. pneumophila---The map mutants grew within macrophage-like U937 cells and Hartmannella amoebae to the same degree as did wild-type legionellae, indicating that this acid phosphatase is not essential for L. pneumophila intracellular infection.

Schistosoma haematobium---Human T- and B-cell responses to Schistosoma mansoni recombinant glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase correlate with resistance to reinfection with S. mansoni or Schistosoma haematobium after chemotherapy.
S. haematobium---Recently we reported that human T- and B-cell recognition of a 42-kDa protein (p42) in soluble extracts of adult Schistosoma mansoni worms correlates with resistance to reinfection with S. mansoni or S. haematobium.
S. haematobium---Lymphoproliferation and production of interleukin-4 and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) after in vitro stimulation with rSG3PDH and serum isotype responses to rSG3PDH were examined in individuals with extremes of resistance and susceptibility to reinfection after treatment of previous S. mansoni or S. haematobium infection.
Echinococcus granulosus---Modulation of human immune response by Echinococcus granulosus antigen B and its possible role in evading host defenses.
Echinococcus granulosus---Our objective was twofold: (i) to investigate further the role of Echinococcus granulosus antigen B (AgB) in the human early inflammatory response by determining its effect on polymorphonuclear cell (PMN) random migration, chemotaxis, and oxidative metabolism and (ii) to determine its action in acquired immunity by evaluating AgB and sheep hydatid fluid (SHF)-driven Th1 (gamma interferon [IFN-gamma] and interleukin 12 [IL-12]) and Th2 (IL-4 and IL-13) cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 40 patients who had cured or stable or progressive cystic echinococcosis.
P. gingivalis---When plated on Brucella blood agar, the mutant strain, designated P. gingivalis FLL92, was non-black pigmented and showed significant reduction in beta-hemolysis compared with the parent strain, P. gingivalis W83.
P. gingivalis---Expression of the rgpA, rgpB, and kgp protease genes was the same in P. gingivalis FLL92 as in the wild-type strain.
P. gingivalis---In contrast to the parent strain, P. gingivalis FLL92 showed increased autoaggregration in addition to a significant reduction in hemagglutinating and hemolysin activities.
P. gingivalis---In in vivo experiments using a mouse model, P. gingivalis FLL92 was dramatically less virulent than the parent strain.
P. gingivalis---A molecular survey of this mutant and the parent strain using all known P. gingivalis insertion sequence elements as probes suggested that no intragenomic changes due to the movement of these elements have occurred in P. gingivalis FLL92.
P. gingivalis---Taken together, these results suggest that the recA downstream gene, designated vimA (virulence-modulating gene), plays an important role in virulence modulation in P. gingivalis W83, possibly representing a novel posttranscriptional or translational regulation of virulence factors in P. gingivalis.
C. tropicalis---Using the gene SAPT1 as a probe and under low-stringency hybridization conditions, three new closely related gene sequences, SAPT2 to SAPT4, encoding secreted proteinases were cloned from a C. tropicalis lambdaEMBL3 genomic library.
C. tropicalis---All bands identified by Southern blotting of EcoRI-digested C. tropicalis genomic DNA with SAPT1 could be assigned to a specific SAP gene.
C. tropicalis---Therefore, the SAPT gene family of C. tropicalis is likely to contain only four members.
C. tropicalis---Interestingly, the SAPT2 and SAPT3 gene products, Sapt2p and Sapt3p, which have not yet been detected in C. tropicalis cultures in vitro, were produced as active recombinant enzymes with the methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris as an expression system.
Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae---Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae iron transport and urease activity: effects on bacterial virulence and host immune response.
Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae---Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, a porcine respiratory tract pathogen, has been shown to express transferrin-binding proteins and urease during infection.
A. pleuropneumoniae---We used two isogenic A. pleuropneumoniae single mutants (DeltaexbB and DeltaureC) and a newly constructed A. pleuropneumoniae double (DeltaureC DeltaexbB) mutant in aerosol infection experiments.
A. pleuropneumoniae---Neither the A. pleuropneumoniae DeltaexbB mutant nor the double DeltaureC DeltaexbB mutant was able to colonize sufficiently long to initiate a detectable humoral immune response.
A. pleuropneumoniae---These results imply that the ability to utilize transferrin-bound iron is required for multiplication and persistence of A. pleuropneumoniae in the porcine respiratory tract.
A. pleuropneumoniae---The A. pleuropneumoniae DeltaureC mutant and the parent strain both caused infections that were indistinguishable from one another in the acute phase of disease; however, 3 weeks postinfection the A. pleuropneumoniae DeltaureC mutant, in contrast to the parent strain, could not be isolated from healthy lung tissue.
A. pleuropneumoniae---In addition, the local immune response-as assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter and enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot analyses-revealed a significantly higher number of A. pleuropneumoniae-specific B cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of pigs infected with the A. pleuropneumoniae DeltaureC mutant than in the BALF of those infected with the parent strain.
A. pleuropneumoniae---These results imply that A. pleuropneumoniae urease activity may cause sufficient impairment of the local immune response to slightly improve the persistence of the urease-positive A. pleuropneumoniae parent strain.

Legionella pneumophila---Legionella pneumophila entry gene rtxA is involved in virulence.
Legionella pneumophila---Our laboratory has been examining the role of early events, adherence and entry, in the pathogenesis of the facultative intracellular pathogen Legionella pneumophila.
L. pneumophila---Currently, the mechanisms used by L. pneumophila to gain access to the intracellular environment are not well understood.
L. pneumophila---We have recently isolated three loci, designated enh1, enh2, and enh3, that are involved in the ability of L. pneumophila to enter host cells.
L. pneumophila---In the current study, we demonstrate that the L. pneumophila rtxA gene is involved in adherence, cytotoxicity, and pore formation in addition to its role in entry.
L. pneumophila---Furthermore, an rtxA mutant does not replicate as well as wild-type L. pneumophila in monocytes and is less virulent in mice.
L. pneumophila---Thus, we conclude that the entry gene rtxA is an important virulence determinant in L. pneumophila and is likely to be critical for the production of Legionnaires' disease in humans.

Treponema pallidum---Dendritic cells phagocytose and are activated by Treponema pallidum.
Treponema pallidum---Cell-mediated immune processes play a prominent role in the clinical manifestations of syphilis, a sexually transmitted disease of humans caused by spirochetal bacterium Treponema pallidum.
T. pallidum---The immune cell type that initiates the early immune response to T. pallidum thus far has not been identified.
T. pallidum---Electron microscopy revealed that T. pallidum was engulfed by DCs via both coiling and conventional phagocytosis and was delivered to membrane-bound vacuoles.
T. pallidum---Both T. pallidum and a synthetic lipopeptide (corresponding to the 47-kDa major membrane lipoprotein) activated the XS52 DC line, as indicated by the secretion of interleukin-12 (IL-12), IL-1beta, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and IL-6 and elevated surface expression of CD54.
T. pallidum---The combined data support the contention that DCs stimulated by T. pallidum and/or its proinflammatory membrane lipoproteins are involved in driving the cellular immune processes that typify syphilis.

B. afzelii---It is likely that the suppression of macrophage microbicidal mechanisms contributes to the inhibitory effect of tick saliva on the killing of B. afzelii spirochetes, thus facilitating the transmission of this important pathogen.
Chlamydophila abortus---Identification of protective epitopes by sequencing of the major outer membrane protein gene of a variant strain of Chlamydia psittaci serotype 1 (Chlamydophila abortus).
L. mexicana---Here, we demonstrate that the lesions induced by L. mexicana are delayed compared to those induced by L. major but rapidly develop at later time points.
L. mexicana---Interestingly, while LACK-tolerant BALB/c-derived IE-LACK transgenic mice were resistant to L. major, they were susceptible to L. mexicana and developed lesions similar to those observed in wild-type BALB/c mice.
L. mexicana---The latter result was observed despite the fact that (i) LACK was expressed by L. mexicana, (ii) splenocytes from BALB/c mice were able to stimulate LACK-specific T-cell hybridoma cells when incubated with live L. mexicana promastigotes, and (iii) LACK-specific T cells contributed to IL-4 production in L. mexicana-infected BALB/c mice.
L. mexicana---Thus, in contrast to what was observed for L. major-infected mice, LACK-specific T cells do not play a critical role in determining susceptibility to L. mexicana.
L. mexicana---Although BALB/c mice are susceptible to both L. major and L. mexicana, the mechanisms which are responsible for susceptibility to these parasites are likely to be different.
Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae---Study of antigenic heterogeneity among Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae serotype 7 strains.
A. pleuropneumoniae---Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae serotype 7 strains were studied for their antigenic heterogeneity using rabbit polyclonal hyperimmune sera against all the known twelve reference strains of A. pleuropneumoniae and a battery of different serological tests such as coagglutination (COA), immunodiffusion (ID), indirect hemagglutination (IHA), counterimmunoelectrophoresis (CIE), rapid dot-ELISA (RDE), serum soft-agar (SSA) and growth agglutination (GA).

T. equinum---Especially high degree of nucleotide sequence similarity of more than 99% was noted between the Chs1 gene fragments of M. equinum and A. otae, and those of T. equinum, T. interdigitale and A. vanbreuseghemii, respectively.
A. vanbreuseghemii---The phylogenetic analysis of their sequences revealed that M. equinum was genetically very close to A. otae and T. equinum to A. vanbreuseghemii.
T. equinum---The phylogenetic analysis of their sequences revealed that M. equinum was genetically very close to A. otae and T. equinum to A. vanbreuseghemii.
T. equinum---A molecular analysis of Chs1 genes will provide useful information for the genetic relatedness of M. equinum and T. equinum and confirm the value of DNA sequencing in identification of these two dermatophytes.
C. albicans---One of these series of C. albicans isolates became resistant, with an associated increase in mRNA specific for a CDR ATP-binding cassette transporter efflux pump (K. A. Marr, C. N. Lyons, T. R. Rustad, R. A. Bowden, and T. C. White, Antimicrob.
C. albicans---Here we study this series of C. albicans isolates further and examine the mechanism of azole resistance in a second series of C. albicans isolates that caused disseminated infection in a recipient of bone marrow transplantation.
C. albicans---In the absence of fluconazole, the addition of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), or IL-4 had no effect on the growth of C. albicans.
C. albicans---In the presence of fluconazole, only the addition of IFN-gamma resulted in an increase in the growth of C. albicans.
C. albicans---In the absence or presence of C. albicans the addition of fluconazole, all of the cytokines studied, and combinations of fluconazole and selected cytokines caused increases in nitric oxide (NO) production (P &lt; 0.01).
C. albicans---Similar observations were made for superoxide (O(2)(-)) only in the presence of C. albicans.
C. albicans---The greatest concentrations of NO and O(2)(-) were produced when C. albicans alone was present in the assays.
C. albicans---Our results demonstrate that in the presence of low concentrations of fluconazole (0.1 times the MIC), selected cytokines and their combinations significantly increase the microbicidal activity of MDM against intracellular C. albicans.

B. fragilis---With inocula of 5 x 10(5) CFU/ml and trovafloxacin concentrations of &lt;/=2 microg/ml, a maximum observed effect (E(max)) of >/=6.1 (log(10) CFU/ml) was attained with all pure and mixed cultures within 24 h. With inocula of 10(8) CFU/ml, a similar E(max) and a similar concentration to produce 50% of E(max) (EC(50)) for B. fragilis were found in both pure cultures and mixed cultures with E. coli.
B. fragilis---However, to produce a similar killing of B. fragilis in the mixed cultures with VREF, a 14-fold increase in the concentration of trovafloxacin was required.
B. fragilis---A vancomycin-susceptible strain of E. faecium and a trovafloxacin-resistant strain of E. coli were also found to confer a similar &quot;protective&quot; effect on B. fragilis against the activity of trovafloxacin.
B. fragilis---Using inocula of 10(9) CFU/ml, the activity of trovafloxacin was retained for E. coli and B. fragilis and was negligible against VREF.
B. fragilis---The importance of using mixed cultures and not pure cultures is clearly shown by the difference in the killing of B. fragilis in the mixed cultures tested.
B. fragilis---However, due to its ability to retain activity against large cultures of B. fragilis and E. coli, trovafloxacin could be beneficial in the treatment of intra-abdominal abscesses.
A. baumannii---Regardless of the surveillance method, Enterobacteriaceae, P. aeruginosa, and A. baumannii demonstrated similar rates of susceptibility to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin.

P. brasiliensis---The low nucleotide variation among three P. brasiliensis 18S SSU rDNA sequences contrasts with the surprising amount of nucleotide differences between the two sequences of L. loboi used in this study, suggesting that the nucleic acid epidemiology of this hydrophilic pathogen will be rewarding.
C. albicans---In a recent study (P. Staib and J. Morschhäuser, Mycoses 42:521-524; 1999) of 14 C. dubliniensis and 11 C. albicans isolates, it was suggested that the ability of C. dubliniensis to produce rough colonies and chlamydospores (chlamydoconidia) on Staib agar (SA) provided a simple means of differentiating it from its close relative C. albicans.
C. albicans---In the present investigation, we examined the colony morphology and chlamydospore production of 130 C. dubliniensis and 166 C. albicans isolates on SA and on the related defined medium caffeic acid-ferric citrate agar (CAF).
C. albicans---All of the C. dubliniensis and C. albicans isolates produced chlamydospores on the control medium, i.e., rice-agar-Tween agar.
C. albicans---However, while none of the C. albicans isolates produced chlamydospores on either SA or CAF, 85.4 and 83.8% of the C. dubliniensis isolates produced chlamydospores on SA and CAF, respectively.
C. albicans---All of the C. albicans isolates grew as smooth, shiny colonies on SA after 48 to 72 h of incubation at 30 degrees C, while 97.7% of the C. dubliniensis isolates grew as rough colonies, many (65%) with a hyphal fringe.
C. albicans---In contrast, 87.4% of the C. albicans and 93.8% of the C. dubliniensis isolates yielded rough colonies on CAF.
C. albicans---Although the results of this study confirm that SA is a good medium for distinguishing between C. dubliniensis and C. albicans, we believe that discrimination between these two species is best achieved on the basis of colony morphology rather than chlamydospore production.

P. carinii---BACKGROUND: Prophylaxis against Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia is indicated in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection who have less than 200 CD4 cells per cubic millimeter and in those with a history of P. carinii pneumonia.
P. carinii---METHODS: We conducted a randomized trial of the discontinuation of primary or secondary prophylaxis against P. carinii pneumonia in HIV-infected patients with a sustained response to antiviral therapy, defined by a CD4 cell count of 200 or more per cubic millimeter and plasma HIV type 1 (HIV-1) RNA level of less than 5000 copies per milliliter for at least three months.
P. carinii---After a median follow-up period of 20 months (758 person-years), there had been no episodes of P. carinii pneumonia in the 240 patients who discontinued prophylaxis (95 percent confidence interval, 0 to 0.85 episode per 100 person-years).
P. carinii---After a median follow-up period of 12 months (123 person-years), there had been no episodes of P. carinii pneumonia in the 60 patients who discontinued prophylaxis (95 percent confidence interval, 0 to 4.5 episodes per 100 person-years).
P. carinii---CONCLUSIONS: In HIV-infected patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy, primary and secondary prophylaxis against P. carinii pneumonia can be safely discontinued after the CD4 cell count has increased to 200 or more per cubic millimeter for more than three months.
P. carinii---Whether secondary prophylaxis against P. carinii pneumonia can be safely discontinued in patients who have a response to highly active antiretroviral therapy is not known.
P. carinii---METHODS: We analyzed episodes of recurrent P. carinii pneumonia in 325 HIV-infected patients (275 men and 50 women) in eight prospective European cohorts.
P. carinii---No cases of recurrent P. carinii pneumonia were diagnosed during this period; the incidence was thus 0 per 100 patient-years (99 percent confidence interval, 0 to 1.2 per 100 patient-years, on the basis of the entire follow-up period, and 0 to 1.3 per 100 patient-years, on the basis of the follow-up period during which CD4 cell counts remained at or above 200 per cubic millimeter).
P. carinii---CONCLUSIONS: It is safe to discontinue secondary prophylaxis against P. carinii pneumonia in patients with HIV infection who have an immunologic response to highly active antiretroviral therapy.

C. albicans---VER-002-treated animals showed a significant dosage-dependent clearance of C. albicans from the tongue, oropharynx, esophagus, stomach, and duodenum in comparison to that for untreated controls.
C. albicans---In vitro time-kill studies and a rabbit model of endocarditis and pyelonephritis were used to define the impact that the order of exposure of Candida albicans to fluconazole (FLC) and amphotericin B (AMB), as sequential and combination therapies, had on the susceptibility of C. albicans to AMB and on the outcome.
C. albicans---The contribution of FLC-induced resistance to AMB for C. albicans also was assessed.
C. albicans---In vitro, AMB monotherapy rapidly killed each of four C. albicans strains; FLC alone was fungistatic.
C. albicans---This antagonistic effect persisted for at least 24 h. Simultaneous exposure of C. albicans to AMB and FLC [AMB+FLC(simult)] demonstrated activity similar to that with AMB alone for AMB concentrations of > or =1 microg/ml; antagonism was seen using an AMB concentration of 0.5 microg/ml.
C. albicans---Thus, our in vitro and in vivo studies both demonstrate that preexposure of C. albicans to FLC reduces fungal susceptibility to AMB.
Hypericum perforatum---Hypericin is a natural derivative of the common St. Johns wort plant, Hypericum perforatum.
Morganella morganii---Holomycin, a member of the pyrrothine class of antibiotics, displayed broad-spectrum antibacterial activity, inhibiting a variety of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, with the exception of Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
C. albicans---A new bioassay in RPMI agar containing methylene blue was developed using C. albicans DSY1024, a mutant rendered hypersusceptible to FLC constructed by the deletion of the multidrug efflux transporter genes CDR1, CDR2, CaMDR1, and FLU1.

B. adolescentis---The two 16S rDNA sequences of B. adolescentis E-981074(T) exhibited microheterogeneity differing in eight positions over almost the total length of the gene.
B. cereus---Two tomato lines, one previously found to support high and the other low growth of B. cereus UW85 in the spermosphere, had similar effects on growth of each of a diverse, worldwide collection of 24 B. cereus strains that were inoculated on seeds and planted in sterilized vermiculite.
B. cereus---In contrast, among RILs that differed for support of B. cereus UW85 growth in the spermosphere, we found no difference for support of growth of the biocontrol strains Pseudomonas fluorescens 2-79 or Pseudomonas aureofaciens AB254.
B. cereus---Thus, while the host effect on growth extended to all strains of B. cereus examined, it was not exerted on other bacterial species tested.
B. cereus---When seeds were inoculated with a marked mutant of B. cereus UW85 and planted in soil, RIL-dependent high and low support of bacterial growth was observed that was similar to results from experiments conducted in sterilized vermiculite.
B. cereus---Neither RIL supported detectable levels of growth of indigenous Bacillus soil bacteria, while the line that supported growth of inoculated B. cereus UW85 supported higher growth of indigenous fluorescent pseudomonads and total bacteria.
B. cereus---The vermiculite system used in these experiments was predictive for growth of B. cereus UW85 inoculated on seeds and grown in soil, but the patterns of growth of inoculated strains-both Bacillus and Pseudomonas spp.-did not reflect host genotype effects on indigenous microflora recruited from soil to the spermosphere.

After 24 h of storage at 26 degrees C, oysters were transferred to a refrigerator at 3 degrees C and then analyzed 14 to 17 days later.
V. parahaemolyticus---The V. parahaemolyticus numbers were determined by the most-probable-number procedure using alkaline phosphatase-labeled DNA probe VPAP, which targets the species-specific thermolabile hemolysin gene (tlh), to identify suspect isolates (MPN-VPAP procedure).
V. parahaemolyticus---The two direct plating methods in which nonradioactive DNA probes were used were equivalent to the MPN-VPAP procedure for identification of total V. parahaemolyticus, and they were more rapid and less labor-intensive.

B. licheniformis---Although extracellular gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) activity was always present in PGA-producing cultures of B. licheniformis under various growth conditions, there was no correlation between the quantity of PGA and enzyme activity.
B. subtilis---Moreover, the synthesis of PGA in the absence of detectable GGT activity in B. subtilis S317 indicated that this enzyme was not involved in PGA biosynthesis in this bacterium.
B. licheniformis---Glutamate repression of PGA biosynthesis may offer a simple means of preventing unwanted slime production in industrial fermentations using B. licheniformis.

Providencia stuartii---The emergence of a strain of Providencia stuartii resistant to multiple antibiotics with the exception of amikacin provided a test organism for a microbiological assay for this new semisynthetic aminoglycosidic aminocyclitol.
P. stuartii---The resistance of P. stuartii to all currently used antibiotics allows the utilization of this technique in the presence of other concurrently administered antibiotics and therefore eliminates the need for their inactivation in the assay procedure.
Providencia stuartii---Proteus rettgeri and Providencia stuartii were notably more susceptible to verdamicin.
S. salivarius---Whereas the bacteriocin activity of eight strains of Streptococcus mutans was unaffected by growth in the presence of sucrose, such a medium rendered five S. mutans and one S. salivarius indicator strains unsusceptible to the bacteriocins.
S. faecalis---In contrast, the susceptibility of three S. faecalis and one S. pyogenes strains was unaltered when these indicators were grown in the presence of sucrose.
S. faecalis---Since the S. mutans and S. salivarius strains produced extracellular polysaccharides from sucrose whereas the S. faecalis and S. pyogenes strains did not, it was concluded that a coating of extracellular polysaccharides rendered normally susceptible organisms unsusceptible to bacteriocin action.
S. salivarius---Since the S. mutans and S. salivarius strains produced extracellular polysaccharides from sucrose whereas the S. faecalis and S. pyogenes strains did not, it was concluded that a coating of extracellular polysaccharides rendered normally susceptible organisms unsusceptible to bacteriocin action.
Penicillium avellaneum---A quantitative microbiological assay and a bioautography system with Penicillium avellaneum UC-4376 was developed for the antitumor drugs maytansine, and its homologues, maytanprine and maytanbutine.
B. fragilis---An interpretive scheme for B. fragilis to tetracycline was statistically derived on the basis of the distribution of zone sizes of susceptible and resistant strains: resistant, 18 mm or less; indeterminant, 19 to 20 mm; and susceptible, 21 mm or greater.
Clostridium ramosum---Susceptibility of Clostridium ramosum to antimicrobial agents.
Clostridium ramosum---The susceptibility of 49 strains of Clostridium ramosum to 10 antibiotics was determined by agar dilution and disk diffusion tests.
C. ramosum---Results showed that, among the anaerobes, C. ramosum is second only to Bacteroides fragilis in its resistance to antimicrobial agents.
Plectonema boryanum---The M component of virginiamycin inhibited growth of Plectonema boryanum under both photoautotrophic and heterotrophic conditions.
P. boryanum---Deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis was blocked virtually without delay by virginiamycin M. Since virginiamycin inhibited protein synthesis in a similar fashion in the unicellular Anacystis nidulans, as well as in the filamentous P. boryanum, the mechanism of action of this antibiotic is probably the same in all blue-green algae.
Lactobacillus acidophilus---Mutanolysin had lytic or bactericidal activity against the living cells of Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sanguis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Actinomyces viscosus, which are considered to be etiologic agents of dental caries, but had no activity against S. aureus and all gram-negative strains tested.
B. fragilis subsp---In order to determine the therapeutic value of penicillins in the management of anaerobic infections caused by Bacteroides fragilis, the antibacterial activity of penicillin G, ampicillin, and carbenicillin against 10 strains of B. fragilis subsp.
B. fragilis---Minocycline at 3.1 mug/ml inhibited 72% of C. perfringens, 81% of other Clostridium species, and 66, 75, and 100% of B. fragilis, B. melaninogenicus, and Fusobacterium, respectively.
B. fragilis---B. fragilis was resistant to both penicillin and carbenicillin at 6.2 mug/ml.
B. fragilis---Concentrations of 25 mug/ml for penicillin and 100 mug/ml for carbenicillin were needed to inhibit more than 90% of B. fragilis.
B. fragilis---Organisms other than B. fragilis were moderately or extremely susceptible to the penicillins.
Cephalosporium acremonium---Synthesis of deactoxycephalosporin C by a mutant of Cephalosporium acremonium.
Cephalosporium acremonium---A number of Cephalosporium acremonium mutants blocked in the synthesis of cephalosporin C were investigated for accumulation of other beta-lactam compounds.
Elatobium abietinum---Supercooling and the low-temperature survival of the green spruce aphid Elatobium abietinum.
Elatobium abietinum---Laboratory investigations into the low-temperature tolerance of the green spruce aphid, Elatobium abietinum, revealed that the insect was killed by freezing.
Acholeplasma laidlawii---Serological tests and electrophoretic analysis of protein preparations indicated no relationship to Acholeplasma laidlawii, although this organism survived for at least 10 wk after injection into E. plebejus.
Raphanus sativus---Sugar, organic acid, phenolic acid and plant growth regulator content of extracts of honeydew of the aphid Myzus persicae and of its host plant, Raphanus sativus.
Scenedesmus obliquus---Time course of microsecond-delayed light emission from Scenedesmus obliquus.
Scenedesmus obliquus---The time course of microsecond-delayed light emission and that of prompt fluorescence was measured during the period of light adaptation for the wild-type strain and mutants Nos 8 and 11 of Scenedesmus obliquus, Strain D3, exposed t stimulus light in a photon-counting apparatus.
