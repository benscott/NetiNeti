This is a digital copy of a book that was preserved for generations on library shelves before it was carefully scanned by Google as part of a project 

to make the world's books discoverable online. 

It has survived long enough for the copyright to expire and the book to enter the public domain. A public domain book is one that was never subject 

to copyright or whose legal copyright term has expired. Whether a book is in the public domain may vary country to country. Public domain books 

are our gateways to the past, representing a wealth of history, culture and knowledge that's often difficult to discover. 

Marks, notations and other maiginalia present in the original volume will appear in this file - a reminder of this book's long journey from the 

publisher to a library and finally to you.

The very large sale of about twenty thousand copies of Gh>odrich^s Pictorial Geoo* 
SAPHY OF THE WoRLD io those limited parts of the country (confined almost exclusively 
to New England), in which hitherto it has been extensively brought to the public 
notice, afford abundant proofs of its merits, and its adaptation to the purposes which its 
sagacious and accomplished editor had in view. 

The lapse, however, of fifteen years since its first publication could not, in this pro- 
gressive and stirring age, but leave the work as originally produced, somewhat behind 
the present times, particularly in respect to population, commerce, and public works, 
which, in certain parts of the world, advance at present with such rapid strides. 

To remedy this defect, and to adapt this valuable woric to the political and social 
changes which have taken place since its first publication, the original text has under- 
gone a very careful revision. With a view to the arrangement of the work in two 
separate and independent volumes, â€” one devoted to the Old World, the other to the 
New, (including America and Oceanica), â€” the Chapters have been arranged in a new 
Older. Some, which had become antiquated, have been omitted altogether, and their 
places supplied by new ones ; and in almost every page of those which have been re* 
tained, important, and often extensive, correctipns have been introduced. 

But the improvements which could thus be made did not seem sufficient entirely to 
accomplish the object which the present publisher had in view ; and to complete his 
design he has added to each volume a Supplbbient (separately paged), chiefly devoted 
to those topics upon which the reader might desire information more extensive and 
complete than is given in the original work. The Supplementary Introduction ap* 
pended to the first volume will be found to contain, besides some original views on the 
subject of climate, many valuable and interesting scientific details derived from the most 
recent publications. The supplementary view of the Old World, also appended to the 
first volume, is mainly devoted to the great leading States of Europe, â€” the British, 
French, Austrian, and Russian empures, and the German Confederation ; particularly to 
the British Empire, as being that country of the Old World as to which, for a great 
variety of reasons, the American reader would desire the fullest knowledge. 

The Supplement to the second volume, â€” ^that relating to the New World, â€” is 
largely devoted to the British North American Provinces, which are but very slightly 
treated in the original work, but whose rapid progress in population and wealth, and 
whose intimate oommercial and social connections with the United States, make them 



iv ADVEETISEMENT. 

objects of daily increasing interest. A more foil and complete account of these provin. 
ces is here given than can be found in any other work. The articles devoted to the 
United States embody all the most material information embraced in the pubUshed 
reports of the late Census, as well as full descriptions of those States and Territories 
organized, acquired or explored since the publication of the original work. There is 
also added a pretty full account of the growing British AusliaUan colonies, to which 
the recent gold discoveries have attracted so general attention. 

On the whole, the publisher cannot but hope, that the entire work, taken together, in 
the shape in which it is now presei|ted will afford, npt less by its profuse illustrations 
than by its printed text, a full view of tbe World, precisely suited to meet the wants 
of that great mass of readers who desire to find in a single work a complete geo* 
graphical encyclopedia â€” not too dry ip be studied with pleasure, and adapted to 
entertain as well as to instruct; â€” while, at the same time, it should constitute a reliable 
work of reference upon those valuable and indispensable subjects of knowledge arising 
Â£rom a view of the world in which they live, and of tim beings who inhabit it 

The author of the original work i^ well known; it is pro|)er to state distinctly to the 
public that the re-airangement, revisioB and supplement of tbe work in its present form, 
have been prepared by another but it is believed equally competettt band.

of the sphere into equal hemispheres, the one 
north, and the other south. All places situated 
on the equator have no latitude, and the dajs 
and nights are always of the same length. 
Longitude is also reckoned in degrees of the 
equator. 

BqvinocHal is a great circle of the heavens 
corresponding to the equator on the earth. It 
cuts the horizon of any place in the east and 
west points; and when the sun arrives at this 
circle, it rises and sets in these points, and the 
days and nights are then equal all over the globe. 
Declination is reckoned north and south from it. 

MiqtdnoxeM are the times when the sun enters 
the equinoctial points. This is about the 21st 
of March and the 2dd of September; the former 
being the vernal, and the latter the autumnal 
equinox. 

BvaporoHan is the conversion of water into 
vapor, which, by this process, is raised into the 
atmosphere, and, by a si^bsequent, but partial 
condensation, forms clouds. As a very consid- 
erai^e part of the earth's surface is covered 
with water, which is constantly evaporating and 
mixing with the atmosphere m the state of va- 
por, a precise determination of the rate of evap- 
oration must be of great importance in physical 
geography. Accordingly, many experiments 
have been made by different philosophers to de-' 
termine this point. From these we learn, that 
evaporation is confined entirely to the surface 
of the water, to which it is consequentljr pro- 
portional. Much more vapor, therefore, rises in 
m*r 'time countries, or those interspersed with 
.akes, than in inland countries. More also rises 
during hot weather than cold ; hence the quan- 
tity of evaporation depends upon the tempera- 
ture. 

Oeographg is a description of the earth's sur- 
face ; but the enlarged sense of the term in- 
cludes a description, both of the inhabitants and 
productions of the terrestrial globe. Maihemai' 
ual geography describes the figure and magni- 
tude of the earth, its diurnal and annual revolu- 
tions, the cause of day and night, the succession 
of the seasons, the method of determining the 
positions of places on the earth's surface, and 
the comparison of linear measures, with the 
construction and use of maps. Physical geog" 
rapky delineates the principal features in the as- 
pect of nature, by which the diversified regions 
of the globe are distinguished Crom each other, 
and portrajrs their agency on its inhabitants and 
productions. Cml or PoUlieal geography delin- 
eates the empires, kingdoms, and states, which 
occupy the surfiioe of the earth, and exhibits the 
monuments of human industry and skill. 

CRaeUn is a name given to extensive fields 
of ice among the Alps. Some of them clothe 
the elevated valleys on these lofty regions, 
while others envelope the sides and summits of 
the mountains ; the former are denominated 
kywer, and the latter upper gladers. Those in 



the valleys consist chiefly of solid ice. On the 
sif mmits of the mountains they are composed of 
snow. 

Chaviialion is the tendency which every par* 
tide of matter has to every other particle, st 
finite distances from each other. What is cdlsd 
gravitation with respect to the gravitating body, 
IS called attraction, in reference to the body 
gravitated to. As all bodies, whatever may be 
their nature or magnitude, are only aggregated 
particles, gravitation takes place proportionally 
between tl^m; and this power thus becomes the 
most universal agent of the mate'hal world. It 
is by it that bodies retain their forms ; that the 
component parts of the earth, and the other 
planets, are not dissipated in the boundless re- 
gions of space ; that terrestrial bodies, when 
unsnpportecl, descend to the earth ; that the 
planets and their satellites are retained in their 
orbits ; and that the solar system itself naia- 
tains its place in the universe. 

Harbor is a place of safety for ships. 

Hemisphere is half the globe when it is sup- 
posed to be cut throuch the centre by the plane 
of one of its great circles. Thus the equator 
separates the northern and southern bemis- 
pberes ; the meridian divides the eastern and 
western, and the horizon the upper and lower. 

Horizon iB the great circle of the sphere which 
divides its surface into the upper and lower 
hemisphere. In this sense it is called the ra- 
tional horizon, and its plane passes through the 
centre of the earth. 

Horizon sensible or tisible is the small circle 
of the sphere which bounds the observer's view, 
and separates the visible from the invisible part 
of the globe. 

IsloM is a portion of land wholly encoropan- 
ed by water; as Ghreat Britain or Ireland. 

Isthmus is a narrow neck of land uniting two 
continents, or frequently a peninsula to a conti- 
nent ; as the Isthmus of Darien. 

Leike is a portion of water, either entirely 
surrounded by land, or having no other outlet 
than a river, by which its contents are dis- 
charged. When a lake is very extensive, it 
obtains the denomination of sea ; as the Caspi- 
an Sea. 

LaHhtde is the distance of a place f^om the 
equator, and is estimated in degrees, minutes, 
&c., on th^ arc of the meridian passing through 
the place. Hence the latitude is either north 
or south, as the place is situated on the north 
or south side of the equator. The latitude of a 
place is always equal to the elevation of the 
pole above the horizon of that place. 

League is the 20th part of a degree. 

Loi^ilude is the distance of a place eastward 
or westward from the first meridian, and is meas- 
ured on an arc of the equator. It is by the 
combination of latitude and longitude that the 
situation of a place on the earth's surface is de- 
1. As a degree of longitude is the 380th

islroduce but kttle alteration into the configura- 
6mm of the countries it contains. Otherwise, 
the naakiplicity of objects it must comprehend, 
and the alteration they would undergo, would 
laador the representation altogether inadequate 
to the purpose. If, for instance, it is intended

enables the geographer to present the old and 
aav continents unbroken ; the one being ezbib- 
iled in the eastern, and the other in the western. 
Hm piBoipal aim in this choice should be to 
a^bit the most fiiUiul picture of the regions 
to be represented, upon the largest scale which 
the size of the map will admit, and consequent- 
If lo ezclude ot^ thing foreign to the object in

the bottom south, the right hand east, and the 
NK hand west. 

Mtantrt. The English statute mile consists of 
5,8aO feet, 1,760 yards, or 8 furlongs. The Rus-

chains of these eminences. 

JVbri4 is that point of the horizon which is 
equally distant from the east and west points, 
and is diametrically opposed to the south. 

Oa$i$ is a term frequently applied to a fbrtile 
district amidst vast deserts of sand. Several of 
these occur in the sandy oceans of the African 
deserts; where the contrast was so great, as to 
induce the ancients to regard them as the Htt- 
peridei, or isles of the blessed. 

Ocean is the term by which the vast mass of 
waters covering about two tiiirds of the earth's 
surface is designated. For the sake of perspi- 
cuity, geographers have supposed it to be divid- 
ed into various parts, to which they have given 
particular names. 

Pampas is a name given by the South Ameri 
cans to the vast plains, which characterize theii 
country. 

PanUUh of laHhtde are small circles c( the 
sphere parallel to the equator. 

Pernnsvla is any portion of land nearly sur- 
rounded by water. The term is generally ap- 
plied to those parts which project into the 
ocean, and are joined to the mam land by an 
isthmus. 

Plateau is an elevated plain, or an^high table- 
land terminated on all siaes by dechvities. The 
central parts of Asia, the middle regions of 
Spain, and the vast elevated lands on which' 
Mexico is situated are all of this kind. 

Polar drcka are two small circles of the 
sphere which encompato the fHgid zones, and 
are 23^ S8' distant from the poles. 

Pole is the point on the earth's surfiice where 
it is penetrated by the axis. As this axis termi- 
nates in two opposite points, the one is the north 
and the other the south pole, and each is 90^ 
from the equator. 

Prairie is a term applied to the unwooded 
tracts in the great valley of the Mississippi. 

Promontory IB a portion of land projectinff into 
the sea, the end of^ which is generally caUed a 
cape. 

Kiver is a considerable body of water collect- 
ed in the mora elevated parts of the land, and 
descending into the lower, ekher discharging it- 
self into another river or flowing into the sea. 
The courses of rivers always mark the greatest 
declivities of land over which they flow, and 
their magnitude is generally proportional to the 
height and distance of their sources. 

Savanna is a term by which Uie vast extend- 
ed plains in America are frequently denoted. 

Sea^ in its general extent, imphes the whole 
of that vast b(My of water which covers a great 
part of the globe. It is, however, used to de-

INTRODUCTION. 



I. ASTRONOMICAL PRINCIPLES. 

1. Oeaeroi Fwim oJ iht Vnietrse. IT we look upward, yiB observa a Mm vault slreiehM 
over our heads, which at night is illumiDated by a multitude of stars. If we go to Europe, 
we obserre the same wonderful display above us. If we travel to Arabia, or China, or the 
idnds of the Pacific, or to the Fobr regioos, wher#er we may go, still the sl^ b ovet 
IB, ttxl the sun, moon, and stars shine down upon us. The earth is evidently swung in the 
nr Gke a ball, supported by no foundation, and only kept in its place by the power of an 
Almighty Being. 

If we keep our attention fixed upon our earth and the heavenly bodies, we shall soon dis- 
cover that several of them are in motion. The moon revolves around the globe. Some of 
S

ibe stars changs tfaeir phicw. The son itself is obaenred to lum roiiiMl. IT we inTesdntf 
still tiirtber, we dmll discover that these brilliant orbs, which occupy the heaveiis, are all of 
them worlds, Bome of them larger and some smaller, all moving in their appointed courses, and 
all ful611ing the will of the Almigh^ Architect who made ibem. 

The study of the heavenly bodies is called astronoray : geography, strictly speaking, is a 
description of the earth. However interesting and wonderftd Uie subject of astronomy mty 
be, we can only attend to it here, so far as may be aecessary to complete our view of ihe 
globe we inhabit. 

3. Fixed Stars, CotuUllationt. The stars nearest to our earth are groupAl into signs or 
constellations, for the convenience of description ; but the more distant appear to the eye as 
nebulous patches or streaks of diluted light, which optical instruments have enabled us to 
resolve partially into clusters of stars, and these analogy teaches us to regard as myriads of 
suns ; while imagination, ranging through illimitable space, pictures still more remote orbs, 
whose ll|ht has for ages travelled the vast profound, without yet reaching the abodes of disb. 
The great mass of these stars appear to us to remain in the same relative situation, and have 
therefore been called Fixed Stars, although it is probable that they are all in a state of motion, 
fllheir number seems to be beyond calculation, their distance from the earth is loo great to be 
measured by huiran skill ; but mathematical considerations show us, that it cannot be so small 
as nineteen trillions of miles ; bow much larger it may be we know not. 

3. Solar Si/sUm. But the celestial bodies with which we are most familiarly acquainted, 
are those which are called plattets or wanderers, and which revolve around the sun as their 
common centre of gravity. These bodies, of which the terraqueous globe is one, together 
with several secondary planets which revolve around the larger, an unknown number of 
comets, and the Sun itself, the great central mass, form what is called the Solar Syslem, 

(1.) Primary Planets. Those planets which revolve around the sun are called pritnary 
planets, and the number known is twenty six, beside our Earth, but it is not at all improb- 
able that there may be others yet undiscovered. Four of them are remarkably large and 
brilliant. Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn ; another. Mercury, is also visible to the naked 
eye as a large star, but, on account of its nearness to the sun, is seldom conspicuous ; a sixth, 
Uranus or Herschel, is barely discernible without a telescope ; the remainder including Neptune 
and the asteroids, are not visible to the naked eye. Five of these planets. Mercury, Venus, 
Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, have been known and named from the earliest ages of history ; 
Uranus or Herschel was discovered by Herschel in 1781 ; the other twenty have been dis- 
covered stilt more recently. Saturn is distinguished from the other planets by its being sur- 
rounded by two luminous rings concentric with itself, which are visible only by means of a 

(2.) Satellites. The smaller bodies, which revolve round 
several of the primary planets, and probably serve as moons 
to (heir inhabitants, are called secondary planets or salrlliles. 
The number of satellites certainly known is fourteen, four 
more are suspected, and it is not impossible that tlie number 
may even be larger ; of these, one, the moon, belongs to the 
earth, four to Jupiter, seven to Saturn, and certainly two,* 
probably five or six, to Uranus. 

(3.) Comtts. A third class of bodies belonging to the 
sotar system, are the comets, with the nature of which we have 
but slight acquaintance. Their actual number is unknown, 
but is supposed to amount to some thousands. They gener- 
ally consist of a large and splendid, but ill-defineii nebulous 
7t<jrÂ«BB. mass of light, called the head, which is usually much brighter 

I towards die centre, and ofiers the appearance of a vivid 
I nucleus, like a star or planet. From the head, and in a 
dire^on opposite to that in. which the sun is situated from the 
comet, appear to diverge two streams of light, which grow 
broader and more dilfused at a distance from the bead, and 

â€” ; â€” which sometimes unite at a litde distance behind it, and some- 

Satmn witk Ut sutUtu*. times continue distinct for a great part of their course ; this 

it called the tail Some cornels, however, have no tail, and some have as many as five or 




INimtDUCnOK. . 19 

MX. The ieaglh of these a^^endagos is sometimes immense ; thtt of tbe oomet of 1680 wu 
40 iDillion leagues. These bodies revolve round the sun in vety elliptic orbits, some inovii^ 
with great Telocity, others with extreme slowness, some u a direct, and others in a retrograde 
romse ; but it has been shown that their motions are regulated hj the same general laws as 
those of the planets, and the limes of the revolutions of several are known. 

4. Rotation of the Sun and Plantti. From the phenomena of the spots, which, by the aid 
(^ a telescope, are visible on the sun's disc, we are led to the conclusion, that that body re- 
Tolres from east to west on an axis, in about twenty-five days and a half. If a spot is carefully 
watcbed, when first discovered on the eastern edge of the disc, it will be found fo move 
gradually toward the centre, and thence toward the western edge, until at length it enlirely 
disappears in that direction ; and in about fourteen days it is often seen again on the eastern 
side. That the moon, and Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, have each a rotation 
from west to east is Inferred in like manner from the spots that are seen to traverse their discs. 
The moon always presents the same side to the â‚¬artb, and must, therefore, revolve on her axis in 
the same time in which she is carried round the earth by her revolution in her orbit. In the 
remaining planets no appearances have been disco^'ered which enable us to ascertain whether 
or not tbey revolve on axes ; though from analc^ it is highly probable that they do.

6. tSpparent Animal Motion of tht 5tm. Zodiac. Beside the apparent daily motion of 
the suD round (he earth, he also appears to move eastward among the fixed stars. The circle 
which the plane of the path or orbit thus annually described, marks out on the sphere of the 
heavens, is called the tcUptic. It passes through twelve constellations, which are called the 
(mire tigm. This has given rise to the division of the ecliptic into twelve equal parts, which 
are also called Hgns, and each of which of course contains 30 degrees, or one-twelftb of a 
whole circle of 360 degrees. The twelve signs are contained in a zone or belt of the starry 
heavens, 47 degrees in breadth, called the Zodiac. The names of these constellations, witD 
the characters by which they are usually denoted, are as follows :

6. Equinox. Sohtict. A circle of the celestial sphere, whose plane passes through the 
earth's cenlrei and is perpendicular to its axis, is called the ctleslial eyvator ; this circle is c\t 
by the ecliptic in two opposite points, called liie eguinoctial points. The first point of Aries 
coincides with the point of the vernal equinox, and the first point of Libra with that of the 
autumnal tqmnox. As the sun on leaving the point of the vernal equinox advances id the 
ecliptic, his meridian altitude above our horizon daily increases, and hence arises a gradual 
increase in the length of the day, until the sun reaches his greatest ahitude, and the day acquires 
its greatest length ; the point of the ecliptic at which the maximum takes place is called the 
â€¢Summer Solstice. Having reached this point the sun now turns hack towards the equator 
which he crosses at the point of the autumnal equinox ; his meridian altitude and the length of 
the days are now gradually diminishing, and the point at which ihey become least is called the 
Winter Solstice. The vernal equinox falls about the 21st of March, the summer solstice oo 
the 31st of June, the autumnal equinox about the 33d of September, and the winter solstice 
the 23d of December.

The following illustration of the relative magnitudes and distances of tbe parts of our system, 
as stated in tbe above table, is given by the celebrated astronomer Herschel. " Choose,"

II. THE EARTH, ITS FIGURE, DIMENSIONS, &c. 

1. Tkt Karth, The earth is a planet, of a globular shape, and forming very tiearly a 
periact globe or sphere. Like the other planets it has two motions ; its rotation on its ovm 
axis, completed io about 23 hours and 56 minuter, caus- 
es the apparent daily revolution of ilie sun and heavens 
round the earth, and thus produces the alternation of day 
and night ; its motion in its orbrt, which carries it rcund 
the sun \o about 365 days and 6 hours, produces Uie al- 
ternation of the seasons. That the earth is round, is 
proved by several considerations, such as the shape of 
Its shadow on the moon during an eclipse ; the fact [hat 
it is constantly circumnavigated, so that a ship, by steer- 
ing in a general direction, either eastward or westward, 
arrives a^in at its point of departure, and also by the 
appearances, exhibited by vessels at sea. At a short 
SsObb* die boll of the vessd is sunk below the horizon ; a little further the lower sails dis- 
â– pMT, and then ifae topsails. 
* 2. ^xU, Pola. The axU 

of the earth is an imaginary 
line passing through Its cen- 
tre, and about which it re- 
volves ; the extremities of 
the axis are called ihe poles ; 
the north pole is called Src 
lU,M,r^t^,^,hssphÂ«^^tk*E.rth. ift pole, from its being in 

the direction of the Great Bear (in Gre^ ^rctoi) ; the south pole, the Antarctic. 

3. Equator, Meridian, An imaginary great circle, passing round the earth from east to 
west, and equally distant from both poles, k called the equator ; imaginary great circles drawn 
rouod the earth from north to south, passing throu^ the poles, and intersecting the equator at 
rigbt aisles, are called meridiatu. 

4. Latitude and Longitade. The relative position of a place on the earth's surface is 
determined by its distance north or south of the equator, and its distance east or west of any 
^en meridian, called the prime meridian ; on English and American maps and globes the me- 
ridiaa of Greenwich in England, is generally assumed as the prime meridian ; but American 
EWgraphers often adopt that of Washington, and other nations those of their respective capitals. 
DisUnce from the equator is called latitude j distance from the prime meridian is called 
Ingitvde. 

5. Btgrtet, ^. The geographical measure of distance is a degre* or 860th part of a great 
circle of the earth ; the degree is divided into 60 minutes and the mmute into 60 seconds. 
Circles passing round the earth parallel to the equator at given distances from each other, 
i^Mher of one, five, or ten degrees, are called parallelt of latitude, and serve to show at what 
Antnce from the equator are the points through which they pass. In the same way meridians 
â– redrawn round the earth's surface from north to south at the same distances. 

6. TVopiea. In spring and autumn, the sun appears to move round the earth over the equa- 
torid regions ; but in summer the sun appears to be 23^ degrees ncrth, and in winter the same 
tUmx south of the equator. Circles passing round the earth at these points are called tropict. 
Tin u the south of the equator beuig the tropic of Capricorn, and that at the north the uopic 
ttCtmxi. 

7. Polar Circlet. When the sun is in the tropic of Cancer, he is not vbible round the 
Ailarctic pole for a distance of 231 degrees ; and on the contrary, when he is in the tropic of 



22 INTEODUCnON. 

Capricorn, he is not visible for the same distance round the Arctic pole. Circles dnwn rouDd 
!, are called respectively the iSrctie and â€¢SntarcHe circU, 
'cles and the tropics divide the surface of the earth into five bands or 
between the tropics, on both sides of the equator is called the fanrii 
the tropic of Cancer and the Arctic circle, is called the northern teÂ»- 
luded within the Arctic circle the northern frigid zoiih. Between ihs 
the Antarctic circle, is the touthern temperate zone, and withia ibe 
them frigid zone. 

DiviHone of the Earth. The mean diameter of the earth is 7,913 
e at the equator nearly 34,900 miles ; and its area 198 million squire 
vided into land and water ; ihe former occupies about 50 million sqiuit 
I millions, being nearly three fourths of the whole surface. 
' the Earth. In order to obtain a correct conception of the appearanct 
tb, representations of that surface, on a small scale, ought to be pre- 
lere are two ways in which the earth may be thus represented to our 
d by maps. 

ipearance of the surface of the earth may be delineated upon the sur- 
face of a solid having the same figure as the earth. 
This is the roost accurate mode of representttioD, 
for an exact image of it may in this way be form- 
ed. Such an image of the earth is called a ter- 
restrial globe. 

12. jilaps. The other way of represenlii^ tbe 
earth's surface, is by drawing a part of it upon i 
plane. 8uch drawings are caUed maps. The 
necessity of maps arises from large globes being 
ver)' expensive and inconvenient for use ; while 
on small ones sufficient details cannot be intro- 
duced. 

Maps are constructed by making a prqiec^on of 
the globe, on the plane of some particular circle) 
supposing the eye placedit some particular point, according to the rules of perspective. 

In maps three things are required ; First to show the latitude and longitude olplaces, wluch 
is done by drawing a certain number of meridiaas imd parallels of latitude ; Secomlly, ^ie 
shape of the countries must be exhibited as accurately as possible ; for real accuru^r cannot 
be obtained by projection, because the map is on a plane surface, whereas the earth is globu- 
lar ; Thirdly, the bearings of places, and their distances from each other must be shown. 

In all maps, the upper part is the north, the lower the south, the right the east, and the left 
(he west. On the right and left the degrees of latitude are marked. 



III. LAND AND WATER. 

1 . ContinetUs. The land surface of the earth is divided into three vast masses caUed em- 
tinentn, and numerous smaller tracts, called ialandi. The tattem continent comprises thrte 
great divisions called Asia, Europe, and Africa, lying chiefly upon the north of the equator ; the 
weitern continent comprises two divisions called North America and South America ; and the 
tovthem continent or New HoUand lies to the south of the equator. The eastern conlineut 
has an area of 31,500,000 square miles ; the western of 14,800,000 ; and the southern of 
4,200,000. 

2. Ulandt. Smaller portions o^ land scattered over the ocean, or otherwise surrounded by 
water, are called islands ; some of ihAe form considerable masses, as Borneo and Madagascar, 
the largest known islands. A number of islands lying near each other is called a grovp or 
cluster ; several groups lying near each other are often called an archipelago. Small islands 
are also called islets ; keys are rocky islets, which are sometimes numerous along the coasts 
of continents or lai^e islands.

Ibw Guinea 



3, Capa, Ptnintuhu, &cc. A part of the land runniHg out into the sea, and joined to the 
mualaDd only b^ a narrow neclc is called a peninrala ; projections of land of less extent, reach- 
ing but a little way into the sea are called eapti^ headlands, promontoriKt, or pointo. A uairow 
neck of land joining latter masses is called an ufAmiu. 

4. Octant. There is in fact one continuous mass of water, called the ocean, surrounding 
(bo land which rises above its level in continents and islands ; but for conTenience sake dt&r 
at puts of it have distinct names given to them, as appears by the following table : 

I. Tbe great Sovthea^m Bonn, the waters of which cover nearly half the globe, 
â– wltides : 

t. The Paeijie Ocean 1 1 ,000 miles in length from east to west, and 8,000 in breadth, occu- 
pfii^ a superficial space rather larger than the whole mass of the dry land. It extends from 
Befaraig's Straits on the noitb, to a line drawn from Cape Ham to Van Diemen's Land on the 
Kunh; and from America on the East, to Asia, Malaysia, and Australia on the west. In 
coojequence of the wide expanse of Its surface it is remarkably exempt from storms, except 
uar its mountainous shores, and hence its name. It is often also called the South Sea ; 

II. Tbe Indian Ocean, lying between Africa on the west, and Malaysia, and Australia on 
the east, and between Asia on the north, and a line drawn from the Cape of Good Eope to 
Vai Diemen*s Land on the south, is about 4,500 miles in length and breadth ; it covers a 
nttce of about 17,000,000 square miles ; 

HI. The Sovtkern or Antarctic Octan surrounds the south pole, lying to the south of a line 
fawn qiute round the ^obe from Cape Horn, aloi% the southern extremity of New Zealtodt 



21 lMTBO0IX7Xi(HC* 

Van Dieman's Landi and Africa, back to the point of startbg. Jt embraces an area of 
30)000,000 square miles. It is generally covered with floating ice as far north as 60^ south 
latitude, and in higher latitudes appears to be blocked up by an impenetrable barrier of fixed 
ice. 

II. The Wtstem Basin forms a channel between the eastern and western continents, and 
washes their northern shores. It mcludes : 

I. The Jitlantic O^ean stretching from the Southern Ocean to the Arcdc circle ; it is about 
6,500 miles in length, varying much in breadth, and it covers an area of 25,000,000 square 
miles ; 

II. The JircHc Ocean surrounding the north pole ; it is in part covered with unpenetrable 
fields of perpetual ice, and it contains large masses of land of unknown extent, lit b often 
called the lev or Frozen Ocean or Polar Sea ; 

5. Uses of the Ocean. Althoi^ it presents to the eye only the image of a watery waste, 
the ocean sustains an important part in the economy of nature. It is the fountain of those 
vapors which replenish the rivers and lakes, and dispense fertility to the soil. By its action on 
the atmosphere it tempers the extremes of heat and cold. It affords an inexhaustible supply 
of food and of salt, a substance hardly less important. As the great highway of commerce it 
connects the most distant parts of the globe, affording facilities of intercourse to nations tlie 
most remote from each other. 

6. Seasj Gulfs^ and Bays. When the ocean penetrates into the land fonning a large ex- 
panse of water, this inland portion of the ocean is usuaUy termed a sea ; such a bodv of water 
of less extent is generally called a gulf or bem ; but these three terms are often contounded. 

The following are the principal bays : Baffin's, Hudson's, James's, Fundy, Passamaquoddy, 
Machias, Penobscot, Casco, Massachusetts, Buzzard's, Narragansett, Delaware, Chesapeake, 
Campeachy, Honduras, Bristol, All Saints, Qardigan, Donegal, Galway, Biscay, Bengal, Wal- 
wich. Fable, False, Angola, Natal, Saldanha, and Botany. 

The following are the principal gulfs : St. Lawrence, Mexico, Darien, California, Panama, 
Guayaquil, St. George, Bothma, Finhmd, Riga, Genoa, Naples, Tarento, Venice, Salonica, 
Persian, Ormus, Siam, Tonquin, Corea, Obi, Guinea. 

The principal seas are the following : Chinese, Carribeau, Mediterranean, Okhotsk, Celebes 
and Corea, Black, North, Red, Baltic, White, Azof, Marmora, and Irish. Â» 

7. Straity Sounds Sic. A narrow passage of water leading from one sea or gulf to another, is 
called a strait ; a wider passage between two large bodies of water is called a channel or sound. 

The principal channels and straits are the following : Davis's, Hudson's, Belle Isle, Mich- 
illimackmac, 6ehring's, Magellan, Skager Rack, Cattegat, Dover, Gibraltar, Bonifacio, Mes- 
sina, Dardanelles, Constantinople, Enghsh, St. George's, North, Babelmandel, Ormus, Mozam- 
bique, Sunda, Malacca, Endeavor, Bass's, Dampier's, and Cook's. 

The foUowii^ are the principal sounds : Long Island, Albemarle, Pamlico, Prmce Wil- 
liim's, Queen Charlotte's, and Nootka. 

8. Harborsj Roadsteads, Sic. SmaU bays or arms of the sea, completely landlocked, or 
so much so as to protect i^ps lying in them from the winds and the sea-swell, are called Dorto, 
hitrbors^ OT havens ; more open arms of the sea, which afibrd good anchoring ground^ are 
called roads or roadsteads. A good harbor must be deep, capacious, and safe. 

9. Jkpih of the Ocean. The bottom of the sea appears to have inequalities similar to the 
surface of the dry land^ and the depth of the water is, therefore, various. There are vast 
spaces where no bottom has been found, and if it is true that the depth of the sea bears any 
IHiilogy to the elevations of the dry land, it would be in some places from 20,000 to 26,000 
feet ; the greatest depth ever sounded is 7,200 feet. 

10. THdes. Tides are regular periodical oscillations in the waters of the ocean, which are 
caused by the attraction of me sun and moon, and which take place twice every twenty-four 
hours, in the open sea they are at their height three hours alter the moon has passed the 
a^ridisui of the place, and the meridian opposite. Their greatest elevations take place in 
narrow seas, where the acdon of the sun and moon is assisted by winds, currents, the position 
of the coast, &c. The highest tides known are in the Bay of Fundy, where the flood rises to 
the height of 70 feet. 

11. Currents. Beside the motions produced by the tide, it has been found that there are 
permanent oceanic currents, always setting in the same direction. There is one called the 
polar current which sets from each pole towards the equator, as appears from the masses of 



mTBCa)UCTI<Â»T. 9B 

Aoilmg ice, eonsttntly movU^; in tfau directioD. Another cuirent, called the Iropitmt cuirent, 
â€¢eti, within the tropics, from east to west ; bo that vessels coming from Europe to America, 
descend tn the latitude of the Canaries, where they are carried rapidly westward, and in going 
fans Ajnerica across the Pacific to Asia, a similar eSect is observed. The Gulf Stream b 
OM of die nuMt remarkable uid best known of the oceanic currotts. 

12. Whirlpools. When two oppoale 
currents of about equal force meet one 
another, they sometimes, especially in 
narrow channels, turn upon a centre an<l 
assume a spiral form, giving rise to toAiVt 
pools. Sometimes the most violent of 
these, /when agitated fay tides or winds, 
become dangerous to navigators. 

13. Saltntgg of the Sta. The waters 
of the sea hold in solution several salts, 
among which are conunon salt or muriate 
of soda, Epsom salt or sulphate of mag- 
nesia, and Glauber's salt or sulphate of 
soda. The salloess of the sea vaiies in 
different places, but is generally less to- 

'^P'"^ wards the poles than near the tropics, and 

ia mkai seas or bays Aap in the open ocean. la some places springs of fresh water rise up 
b Ibe midst of the sea*. The hittemees of sea-water is supposed to be owing to the decom- 
med animal matter which it contains. It is easier to perceive the ereat advantages aridng 
tioa the sahness of sea-water than to discover its origin. Without this saltness and without 
the ablation in which its waves are constantly kept, the ocean would become tainted. It is 
Ronrkable, that the saltness of the sea is less toward the poles than under the equator. 

14. Color of the Sea. The green and yellow shades of the ocean arise from marine plants. 
The spokling of the sea at night presents an imposing spectacle. A vessel, while ploughing 
her way througb the billows, oflen appears to mark out a furrow of fire ; sometimes every 
ttoke of the oar of a boat, emits a light either brilliant and dazzling, or trannull and pearly-. 
Tlus wonderful phenomenon is supposed to be produced, at least in part, by multitudes of small 
pbosphorescent animals that live in the water. 

15. TtiMeratnrt of the Ocean. The temperature of the sea changes much less suddenly 
dan that ot the atmosphere, and it is by no means subject to such extremes of heat and cold 
tube latter. 

IV. SURFACE OF THE LAND. 

1. IntqvaliHe* of Surface. The inequalities of the earth's surface arising from mountains and 
nfieyi, m^ be Kkeoed to the rouglmesses on the rind of an orange compared with its general 
â€¢MS. Tlie highest mountain known does not exceed five miles in perpendicular height ; this 
ii oiJy one IdOOth part of the euth^s diameter, and on a globe of 16 inches in diameter, such 
a mountain would be represented by a promberance 
of cuie hundredth part of an inch, which is about the 
thickness of drawing-paper. The deepest mine 
does not penetrate half a mile below the surface ; 
and 4 scratch or pin-hole duly representing it on the 
surface of such a globe, would not be perceptible 
without a magnifier. The greatesi depth of the. sea 
does .not probably much exceed the greatest eleva- 
tion of the continents, and the ocean would be re* 
presented by a mere Glm of liquid, sucb as in our 
model would be left by a brush dipped in color, and 
drawn over those parts intended to represeni the sea. 
3. Mountains. The greatest elevations of the 
earth's surface ere called mountains ; elevations of 
an inferior height are called kills. Mountains are 
Pinrtflh tfya sometimes completely insulated, but they are more 



26

commonly disposeo in cnains ; a cAotn is a series of mountains, the bases' of which are cob 
Unuous. Several chains are of^en connected with each other, forming a grovp ; and serenl 
groups in the same manner form a syxtem. 

The height of mountains is their elevation above the level of the sea, and as the bases an 
often situated upon elevated plains, the apparent height of the mountainous peaks is much ien 
than their ahsolute height. Cols or necks are depressions in mountainous chains afibrding i 
passage from one dechvity of the ridge to the opposite ; they are sometimes called gaUt, 
gap$, or patta.

3. Formt and Use of JHountairu. Mountains, in their exterior forms, exhibit some vane- 
ties, which strike the most inatteotive observer. The highest mountains most frequentlj 
present a surface of naked rock. In some places they shoot up in the form of euormoui 
crystals with sharp angles. Sometimes there appears an immense, steep, and abrupt surface, 
which seems to lay open to view the bowek of the mountain itself. These appearances ire 
described under the names of needlei, peoJti, &ct There are other mountains, the tops of 
which present circular outlines, which ^ve ihem an air of tranquillity. The mountains of New 
England and the Appalachian chain generally, are of this character. Some mountains rise in 
majestic and regular gradations, like a vast amphitheatre ; others present a large mass cut 
perpendicukrly in the form of an altar, like the Table Mountain at Uie Cape of Good Hope. 
There are mountains in China which resemble the heads of dragons, tigers, and bears. Id 
other places there are labyrinths of rocks, which rise in the form of pillars. In the south- 
eastern part of France, there is a mountain in a single mass in the form of a large nine-pin. 
In another part of France, there are mountains wbi^ are described as resembling the old- 
fashioned frizzled wigs. lu short, the varieties in toe form of mountains, as described bj 
travellers, seem to be almost infinite. Some of them are highly picturesque and beautiful, anl 
Gil the mind of the beholder with pleasing emotions. Others are lofty, ru^ed, and sublime, 
and awaken feelings of awe and astonishment. 

The utility of mountains is very great. They attract the clouds and vapors, which become 
condensed by cold, and fall in the shape of snow and rain, thus giving birth to innumerable 
streams, which descend and spread fertility and beau^ over the surface of the earth. 

4. Voleanots. Those mountaini 
which send forth from their summtli 
or sides, flame, smoke, ashes, aod 
streams of melted matter or Ian, 
are called volcanoes. The deep 
hollow from which Jliese substanca 
are emitted is called a crater. Some 
elevations merely discbarge mud or 
air, and have received the name of 
air or mud volcanoes. 

Many mountains present appea^ 
ances, which prove that at some 
former time they must have beeo 
outlets of fire, although they hive 
long ceased to have any volcanic 
action ; these are ' called extitd 
PHMw. Tolcanoei. 



INTRODUCTION. 87 

From most active volcanoes, smoke issues more or less constantly ; but the eniptions, whicb 
ire discbarges of stones, asbes, end lava, with columns of flame, violent explosions, and 
concussions of the earth, happen at irregular, and sometimes at loi^ intervals. There are 
about 300 volcanoes upon the surface of the earth. 

A vast volcanic zone surrormds 
Greece, Italy, Germany and 
France. Several isl)|nds in tbe 
Grecian Archipelago, have been 
' raised from the sea by volcanic 
convulsions. Etna has burnt for 
many ages, and is surrounded by 
extinguished volcanoes, which ap- 
pear still more ancient. The Li- 
pari ishinds seem to be formed 
chiefly of the lava and other sub- 
stances which have been thrown 
from their volcanoes. Other parts 
of Europe exhibit traces of vol- 
canoes now extinguished. Iceland 
bas several volcanoes, of which 
Hecla, is the most remarkable. 
The very bottom of tbe ocean in 
the neighborhood of this island, 
is sometimes convulsed, and the 
wares often heave up whole fields 
I of pumice stones. 

The origin of volcanoes is t 
FoUaiutldamdi>,ih*Sm. Buhiect upon which scieoliflc men 

Lave entertained different opinions ; the modem geologists regard them as funnels, or ouileu to 
the moulien substance, of wbicb they suppoci the inteiior of the earth tb be composed. 

Tbe eruption of a volcano is a most frightful and majestic phenomenon. The first ugni 
which announce that the invisible combat of the elements has already commenced, bm violent 
movements, which shake tlie earth afar off, prolonged bellowings and subterranean Uunders, 
which roll in the sides of the agitated mountain. Soon the smoke ascends in the shape of a 
black column. This is dispersed by the winds, and formed into trains of clouds. A volume 
oC flame rises above the clouds, seeming like a pillar of fire, wbich rests upon the ground and 
threatens to set the skies in a blaze. A black smoke environs it, and from time to time inter- 
cepts tbe dasziing brightness. Lighmings appear to flash from die midst of the burning mass. 
On I sudden, the vast pillar of fire seems to fall back mto the crater, and its fearful splendor is 
succeeded by profound darkness. But now ashes, dross, and burning stones are projected in 
diver^ng lines, and fall around tbe mouth of the volcano. Enormous fragments of rocks 
^pear to be heaved against the skies. A torrent of water is often thrown out with impetoosiiy, 
md rolls hissing over ^e inflamed rocki. There is then raised from the bottom of the crater a 
Bquid mass of burning lava, which fills the cavi^ and reaches to the very top of the opening. 
Tbis is the prelude to real disasters. The liquid matter overflows, and runs down the sides 
of tbe mountain. It advances like a large end impetuous river, destroys whatever it meets 
nihil] its course, flows over those obstacles which it cannot overturn, passes along tbe ram- 
pirts of shakes cities, invades a space of country of several leagues in extent, and transforms, 
IB a short time, flourishing fields mio a burning plain. 

5. Earthquakes. Earthquakes are supposed to be intimately connected with volcftioes, and 
usually take place in volcanic countries. There have been frequent earthquakes near the 
borders of the Mediterranean Sea, and around the Gulf of Mexico. These dreadful phenom- 
wa ofmn change the surface of a country, so that it is difficult to recognise it. During the 
coavulsion, enormous gaps in the earth appear to disclose to the living the empire of the dead ; 
tbeie fissures emit blue flames and deadly vapors. Vineyards descend from their heights, and 
wile in the midst of fields of com ; farms and gardens quit their glares and become attached 
u distant villages ; towns are ibaken down, villages are swallowed up, mountains sink uto 



TaBeys, lakes disappear, and rocks end islands rear tlieir wet summits from the bosom of <fae 
(bammg sea. 

6. Valleys. The spaces which separate one mountain from another, or one cham from 
another, are called ealteyt, and thetr lowest part is generally the bed of a river, which rises to 
the higher grounds, or of a lake. The tenn valley is abo applied in a wider sense to the whole 
extent of country drained by a river and its branches. 

7. Plaint. The surface of the earth seldom forms a perfect level for any great extent ; it 
has A more or less perceptible inclination, generally rising from the coasts towards the interior, 
and even those regions which are ()escribed as plains, have an undulating surface. In some 
instances there are extensive plains of great elevation, called plateaux or table-landt, the de- 
scent from which to the low countries, exhibits to the inhabitants of the latter the appearance 
of a long chain of mountains. 

8. Deserts, Steppet^ &c. There are vast tracts consisting merely of wide plains of sand tn 
sliingle, or occasionally broken only by bare rocky heights, destitute of water and vegetation, 
and shunned equally by man and beast ; these are called desertt. Interspersed over these 
oceans of sand, we sometimes find fertile spots, watered bv springs and covered with trees, 
called oaaes. In some places we meet with vast plaius entirely destitute of trees, nut bearii^ 
grasses, saline and succulent plants, and dwarfish shrubs. Those which bear nutritive herbage 
are called prairies, llanos, or pampas ; while those which have a scanty, and often only a tern* 
porary vegetation, are called steppes or karroos.

I. Lakes. An inland body of water not immediately connected with the ocÂ«an or any d 
its branches, is called a laki ; but some bodies of this description are also commonly called 
teas. They are generally fresh, but are sell when situated in districts of which the soil contuna 
saline matter. 

3. Classes of Lakes. There are four sorts of kkes. ^1.) The first class mcludes those 
which have no outlet and receive no running water ; these are usually very small. 

(3.) The second class comprises those which have an outlet, but which do not receive any 
nmning water. They are geneially m elevated situations,' and are often the sources of large 
rivers ; they are formed by springs rising up into a lai^e boUoW| until the water nina out over 
the lowesfk part tX the edge of the basin. 

(3.) The third class embraces those lakes which receive and discharge streams of water, 
and is the most numerous. These lakes are tlie recepucles of the waters of the neighboring 
country, but in general have but one outlet which bears the name of the principal river that 
enters the bke. Such a river is said to uaverse or flow through ihe lake, though not v/'a'a 
strict propriety, since its current 's commonly lost in the general mass of waters, and the outlet 
IS in fact a newly formed river. The largest lakes of this class are the great lakes which lie 
en the nortliern frontier of the United States, and of which the St Lawrence is the oniy outlet 
to the sea.

(4.) The focNtb ctass of hftetf iiMshides those which receive without discharging rhrers. 
The hrgest of these is the Caspian Sea, which swallows up several large rivers ; Lake Aral 
ibo belongs to thb class. They are both salt, and this b the case with most of those which 
have no outlet.

3. Periodical Lakes, In tropical countries the violence of the rains often forms temporary 
lakes, covering spaces of several hundred miles m extent. South America has larse lakes 
which are annually formed during the rainy season, and are therefore called periodical lakes ; 
the^ are again dried up by the beats of a vertical sun. 

4. Lagoons, The waters of cme river or several rivers, before reaching the sea, sometimes 
spread oat over a lai^e sur&ce, fflling a shallow basin, which communicates with the ocean by 
a narrow channel. The eastern shore of the Southern States, and the coasts of the Gulf of 
Mexico present a great number of these basins, described under the various names of sounds, 
lakes, and bays ; they may be more properly and conveniently denominated lagoons. 

5. Springs, Springs are small reservoirs, which receive their waters from the neighboring 
ground through smaQ channels, and which are usually discharged by overflowing. The origin 
of springs must be referred to various causes ; among these the most common are the falling 
of rain and dew, and the melting of ice and snow. Mountains attract the fogs and cloudb 
whicb float around them ; consequently more rain and snow (all upon them Uian upon the 
plains. The waters descend, forming innumerable streams, some in the shape of rivers, and 
others in the form of springs. 

Spoutmg springs are formed by having their source considerably elevated above the aperture 
at which they issue. They are constructed on the same principles as artificial fountains, â€” the 
colimm of water being thrown upwards by the pressure from above. Hot spouting springs 
doubdess obey the same laws, the water being heated by volcanic masses in the earth. Boiling 
springs are found in various countries. Periodical, or intermitting springs, are very curious 
works of nature. At Como, in Italy, there is one which rises and falls eveiy hour. There is 
a spring in Provence, in France, which rises eight times in an hour, and another in Languedoc, 
the period of whose elevation each day, is fifty minutes later than the preceding dav. England 
(umishes examples of several springs which rise and fall with the ebb and flow of the sea. 

6. Glaciers. Glaciers, which crown the tops of the highest mountains, have a close con- 
oetion with the origin of springs. The snows which have accumulated for whole centuries, 
Ak down and are consolidated by alternate thaws and frosts. Thus the tops of the mountains 
ire covered with ice ; these masses gradually extend, and the high valleys become filled. Th^ 
QMSses continuing to increase, sometimes for a series of years, even extend to the lower parts 
of the mountains. They have in Switzerland filled up whole vaUeys, buried villages, and shut 
op the pass between Le Valais and the Canton of Berne. The scenes which these bodies of 
ice present to the traveller, are various and striking ; sometimes they resemble the waves of 
the sea ; again they appear like mirrors of brilliant glass. Here a thousand spires glitter in ilie 
stmshbe ; sometimes they assume the appearance of ruins fallen and crushed ; and again vast 
fpuoiis and obelisks are presented to the astonished beholder. 

These glaciers are of essential service in furnishing to the adjacent regions, slowly and in 
flniost a regular manner, waters, which without this congelation would be precipitated with 
nnpetuosiiy from the heights of the mountains, so as to overflow and devastate the countries 
which they now fertilize. 

7. Mineral Springs. The water of springs always contains air and some saline ingredients. 
In good drinkable water the air is usually equal to about one twenty-fifth of its volume, and the 
sÂ«Bne contents form about one 6000th of its weight. Such springs are called soft^ and 
answer well for domestic purposes ; when the solid ingredients exceed this quantity, the water 
Â» fcard, and is less fitted for cooking, dissolving soap, &c. When these substances are in 



39 



such quantities as to produgd very perceptible effects upon tbe animal system, or to show 
decided chemical powers in other ways, the spring becomes a mineral uaUr ; if ihe tempera- 
ture of the water is above the ordinary temperature, then we have thermal or warm springs. 
Mineral waters maybe, 1. acidulous; 2. chalybeate; 3. sulphureous; 4. saline. The first 
generally owe their sparkling appearance and acid qualities to fixed air or carbonic acid. 8ucb 
are the waters of Tunbridge, in En^tnd, of Pyrmont, Spa, and Setters, in Europe, and 
others. The chalybeates generally contain several grains oi oxide of ux>n^ mixed with other 
salts , of this class are the Barrowgate springs, b England, the celebrated springs of Sarati^ 
and Ballston, in New York, and many others in this country. Sulphureous waters owe their 
qualities to the presence of sulphuretted hydrc^en, and some salts m which sulphuric acid is 
combined (sulphates) ; such are the fine group of sulphur springs in Western Virginia, and the 
waters of Aix-la-Chapelle, m Europe. Saline waters contain large quantities of different salts, 
such as common salt, Epsom, Glauber's salt, &c. Those which have but a small portion of 
the medicinal salts, are used for the manufacture of common salt, as in New York, Western 
Virginia, Pennsylvania, and all over the Western States. The source of the peculiar impr^- 
nation of these various waters, is the mineral beds throueh which they flow. The temperamre 
of thermal waters varies from 50^ or 6(P to boiling pomt ; the Hot Springs of Virgmia are 
about 106^, those of Arkansas nearly 200^, and the Geysers of Iceland 212^, or at boiling 
point. Thermal waters are sometimes pure, and sometimes contain mineral ingredients. In 
some cases carburetted or^ sulphuretted hydrogen issues from the ground in great quantities, 
forming blowing or burning springs. The village of Fredonia, in New York, is lighted by 
natural gas, supplied in thb manner. 

8. Rivers. Rivers are natural drains, which convey to the sea that portion of the waters 
falling upon tbe earth, which does not pass off by evaporation, or go to nourish organic bodies. 
The sources of rivers are generally springs, or small streams, fed by the melting of snow and 
ice upon the mountains, or by rains. 

9. Basin. The district from which the waters of a river are derived, is called its basin. 
The basin is bounded by highlands, which are sometimes mountainous, and which divide it 
from oth6r basins. The water descending from the water-shed or dividing ridge collects into 
brooks, the brooks unite into rivulets ; the rivulets united form the main trunk or river, which 
conveys the waters of the whole to the sea. All these descend over inclined planes, so that 
the lowest point of each brook is that where it joins the rivulet ; the lowest point of the rivulet 
that where it unites with the main stream ; and the lowest point in the whole system that where 
the river falls into the sea. These basins form important natural divisions. Those streams 
which empty themselves into larger streams are called the tributaries of the latter.

10. Bid^ Bankty i^. The cavi^. or chaiuiGl, in which a river flows is called its itd, and 
gBKrallj has the appearance of having been cut or worn by the current iiself. The borders 
of the channel are called the banka of the river ; that bank which is to the right of a person 
deaceodiog the stream, or facing the mouth of the river, is called the right bank, and the oppo- 
site is the left bank. The moviK of a river is the point, ivhere it enters into a lake, sea, or 
KOtber river ; in the latter case the point of junction of the two strenms is cslled the con- 
jbnec 

11. Â£t(uan/, Dtlta. Many of the largest rivers mingle with the sea by means of a single 
outlet, Id which case they often spread into wide expanses, called eilvarift or fritfts. Others 
before their termination divide into several branches, embracing a triangular spabe of land 
cdled a delta, from its resemblance to the shape of the fourth letter of the Greek alphabet (A). 

â–  - â–  .. â–  â– __ 12. FalU, Rapids, Bore. When 

the bed of a river suddenly changes 
its level, so that the water plunges 
down a considerable descent, it 
forms a fall, cascade, or cataract. 
When its current is accf leraied by 
a considerable inclination in its 
bed, or broken by a. series of de- 
scents of little height, it forms 
rapids. Some streams rush with 
great force into the sea, carrying a 
large mass of water, which en- 
counters tlie ocean tide, advancing 
in the opposite direction ; the col- 
lision of the opposing currents 
produces a tremendous shock ; this 
phenomenon is called a bore. 
FalUiif/fUgara. 13, ffars. The opposition which 

tiies place between the tide and the cunents of rivers causes, in many instances, collections 
of mud or sand at their mouths, which are called bars, on account of the obstruction wliicli 
die; o&er to navigation. 

U. Periodical Floods. All rivers are more or less subject to occasional or periodical 
floods or inundations. Within the tropics, these floods are produced by the annual rains, and 
oaxa during the summer months, but beyond the tropics, they occur at various seasons, and in 
b!^ latitudes chiefly in the spring, when the snow and ice melt. In some cases where the 
rirer banks are high, the water merely rises in the bed of the river ; but where the banks are 
but little above the level of the river-bed, the waters overflow them, forming vast lake-like 
npuies. 

15. Allueial Deposits. Rivers which pass through low and level tracts in thetr annual mun- 
WoQs, deposit the earth, sand, and graveJ brought down by their waters, on their banks, and 
raise them gradually above the surrounding country, while a part of the matter carried to the 
Ml extends the coast, or forms sand or mud banks, which rise by degrees above the water, 
h ii thus that the Ganges, Po, Nile, Mississippi^ and many other rivers flow on the top of 
â– xlges, behind wbicfa are cijtivated and inhabited districts, lying lower than the level of the 



At INTSODGCmoCI 

waters. During floods, the elevated sides are aomettmeB btirst through, and the waters wUeh 
escape staguate in temporaiy lakes, or return uiio the main streuu lower down, or travel to dn 
sea by a separate mouth 

VI. CLIMATE, WINDS, &c. 

1. Climate. The term climate expresses the particular combination of temperature and 
moisture which characterizes the atmosphere of any particular place. We may disUnguisb io 
general six different combinations or climates, which, however, are infinitely diversified a 
degree ; thus we have warm and moist, warm and dry, temperate and moist, lemper&te and 
dry, cold and moist, and cold and dry climates. 

2. Causes of CItmatt. There are nine circumstances which detennine the character of 
climate : I . The sun's action upon the atmosphere ; 2. the temperature of the earth ; 3. the 
elevation of the ground above the level of the ocean ; 4. the general slope of the ground and 
its particular exposure ; 5. the position and direction of moimtaius; 6. the neighborhood and 
relative siiuation of great bodies of water ; 7. the nature of the soil ; 8. Uie degree of cuhiva- 
tioo and density of population ; and 9 the prevailing winds. 

3. Modijicalioru of Climate. The whole of America, north of latitude 55Â°, may be con- 

sidered a frozen region. In Greenland, and 

around Hudson's Bay, brandy freezes during 

the winter. Tbe ice and snow accumulate on 

the land and water, and cover a great part of 

the country throughout the year. The winter 

begins in August aod continues for 9 months. 

In summer the heat is as great as in New 

England. It continues, however, for too short 

a period to bring grain to maturity, and the 

cultivation of the soil is very little practised. 

Vegetation is too scanty to supply the inbatu- 

tants with any considerable part of their food ; 

tbey therefore live chiefly on seals, and other 

productions of the sea. 

.Â«Â«r^ o, Â« f Â«-r â„¢pâ„¢ Between 55Â° and 46Â°, the climate of North 

America is still severe. In winter, the cold is intense ; and tbe snow, which begins to fall in 

November, remains ull May. The summer advances with such rapidity, that the season of 

spring is scarcely known. In June the fields and forests are covered with luxuriant verdure. 

Grass is abundant, and in some parts grain b cultivated with success. 

The temperate portions of North America may be considered as extending from 45Â° to 
37Â° north latitude. These regions are prolific in grass, grain, and various kinds of fruit, as 
apples, pears, peaches, &c. From 37Â° north to the latitude of 40Â° south, the climate is hot, 
and the products are tobacco, indigo, cotton, rice, and various fruits, and plants called tropical, 
as oranges, lemons, figs, pine apples, sugar cane, coflee, &c. Beyond latitude 4(P south, the 
climate again becomes cold, and at Terra del Fuego, it is severe. At the Georgian Isles m 
latitude 54Â° south, the climate appears to be frigid. 

It seems, therefore, that the temperature in general becomes cold or warm as we approach 
or recede from the equator. Here, beneath a vertical sun, reigns perpetual summer, and na- 
ture puts on a magnificent array of vegetation. As if enchanted by these regions, birds of 
beautiful plumage are seen in flocks amid the ever-verdant groves ; monkeys are sporting on the 
trees, and lurking amid marshes and thickets, are Jaguars, Cougars, and the Jacumana. As we 
leave these countries and proceed to the north or south, there is a gradual change ; not only 
does vegetation assume a less and less exuberant character, but the trees and plants are ex- 
changed for others. The orange gives place to the peach and vine ; these disappear, and the 
hardier fruits, such as apples and pears, are suspended from the trees. These disappear again, 
and forests of dark pine cover trie land with gloom. These dwindle by degrees, until only 
here and there a stunted birch, or willow, the hardiest of trees, is found to endure the mhospi- 
table climate. * 

But while the climate of a country thus chiefly depends upon its nearness to the equator 



INTEODDCTIQN. $$ 

ibne are other circumstanecB which modify or change the cUmate of particular places. Islands 
and coasts feel the influence of the sea air, which is not only moist, but is neither very hot nor 
very cold : it therefore softens the severity of winter, and abates the heat of summer. Conse- 
quendy, places exposed to its influence are rendered more temperate. 

Great accumulations of ice and snow materially aflect climate. The great masses of snow 
and ice in the regions of Greenland impart their chilling influence to the winds, which visit us 
froffl the north, and constitute one of the causes of the greater coldness of our climate, than that 
of other countries in the same latitude. These cold winds, mingled with the sea breezes, 
uhich come from the Atlantic, give that harsh and chilling quality so remarkable in the easterly 
uiods of New England. 

Mountains which shelter a country from cold winds, render the climate warmer. In all 
parts of our country, the southern declivities of mountains, and places tying south of them, 
sheltered from the north winds, are well known to be much warmer. So great b the difierence 
observed in such places, that in some cases plants, which would flourish on the southern side 
of a mountain, would perish oq the northern. 

Elevation above the level of the sea is*an important circumstance in climate. The city of 
Mexico, which according to its latitude should be excessively hot, being elevated 7000 feet 
above the level of the sea, enjoys a climate of perpetual spring. Quito, which lies under the 
equator, has a similar cliniate. Withm sight ol this city, at an elevation of 15 or 16,000 feet, 
the tops of the mountains are so cold as to be covered with never changing masses of snow and 
ice. At the distance of a few miles, the inhabitants of Guayaquil, living oa a low and level 
margin of the sea, experience an intense and sickly degree of heat. 

Thus we have illustrated, in referring to the climate of An^erica, most of the causes which 
form or modify climate generally. It may be here added, that man exercises a slow but pow- 
erful influence upon the climate of those countries, which become the subjects of bis labor. 
By the levelling of forests and the draining of marshes, the sun is let in upon the soil, and the 
climate is rendered warmer, drier, and more salubrious. Such is the powerful influence of this 
cause alone, that our own winters are much shorter, the quantity of snow that falls is conside- 
rably smaller, and the cold far less intense than when our forefathers first settled the country. 
Some parts of the western country, in the United States, once esteemed exceedingly unheal- 
thy, since the clearing up of the forests, have become remarkable for salubrity. 

The climate of Europe is afiected by various circumstances, rendering some parts more 
temperate, and others colder or warmer than might be expected from their latitude. The 
eastern portion of Europe, including two thirds of Russia in Europe, is rendered colder by 
the winds which sweep over it, chilled by the immense masses of snow and ice embosomed in 
the mountains of central Asia. The southern parts of Europe are rendered warmer by the 
hot winds which visit them from the burning deserts and plains of Africa. The extremes 
bodiof heat and cold are diminished in those countries which border upon the Atlantic, by the 
constant action of the sea aur. These appear to be the three great causes, which modify the 
(climate of Europe, and render it so diflerent in some parts, from what it is in others of the same 
latitude ; and so diflerent from the climate of those portions of America, which lie in the same 
parallek. 

There is another fact to be taken into consideration, in comparing the climate of the Atlan- 
tic part of Europe with that of the Atlantic part of North America. In Greenland, and the 
adjacent regions, there are immense masses ol snow arid ice, which accumulate from year to 
year, or are broken up, in the form of icebergs, sometimes reaching the tropics fcefore they 
are melted. On the contrary, on the borders of Europe, such accumulations do not take place. 
The gulfe of Norway are almost always open, while the coast of Greenland, exactly oppo- 
^te, is frequently rendered maccessible, from fixed or floating barriers of ice. 

These considerations will be sufficient to account for most of the contrasts, which we 
observe between our own climate, and that of the Atlantic parts of Europe. The climate of 
England, being surrounded by the sea, is rendered by the sea air much more temperate. The 
>nniers b that country are less extreme, than those of the southern parts of New England. New 
â€¢ouodland, although surrounded by the sea, and further south than England, swept by the winds, 
which come from the icy regions of the north and the adjacent countries, experiences a winter 
so iotense as almost to render it uninhabitable. Spain, Italy, and Turkey in Europe, illustrate 
the mflueoce of the warm winds of Africa. Situated in the latitude of Rlassachusetts and New 
Vofk, they produce oranges, lemons, figs, and grapes, which in our country are the products

4>f regions at least 13 degrees fbnber south. The difference of the eBmaie betnnsm ^ msH 
em aod westero parts of Europe in the same latitude, is shown by the &ct, that at Mosoofir, 
which is in the k^tude of Edinburgh, the winter is so inclement, as to render every precantioii 
necessary to guard against it, while at the latter place it is not more serere than at Boston. 

4. Seasom 0/ the Torrid Zont, There are only two seasons in the torrid Bone ; the diy 
and the rainy or wet. The latter prevails in the tropicd regions over which the sun is verti 
cal, and is succeeded by the dry season, when the sun retires 10 the other side of the equator. 
The rains are produced by the powerful action of a vertical sun, rapidlv accumulating vapors 
by evaporation, which then descend in rains ; this arrangement is wisely adapted to afford a 
shelter from the perpendicular rays of the sun. In some regions there are two rainy seasons, 
one of which is much shorter than the other. Nothing equals the majestic beauty of the sum- 
mer in the torrid zone. The sun rises vertically ; it traverses rapidly the red clouds of the 
east, and fills the heavens with a light, whose brightness is unobscured by a single shade. The 
moon shines here with a more brilliant lustre. Venus blazes with purer and more vivid rays, 
and the milky way glitters with augmented brightness. To all this we may add the serenity 
of the au*, the luxuriance of vegetation, and the gigaidc forms of plants and .animals ; all nature 
more grand and more animated, at the same time, that the seasons are more c(Â»isUait and 
unvarying. 

5. Seasons of the Temperaie Zones, The four seasons which we distinguish b this countty, 
are known only in the temperate zones, which alone are blessed with the varied charms of 
spring and autuma, the tempered heats of summer, and the salutary rigors of winter. In the 
part of the temperate zone bordering on the tropics, the climate resembles that of the intertrop- 
ical regions ; and it is between 40^ and 60^ of latitude, that the succession of seasons is motX 
regular and perceptible. 

6. Seasons of the Frigid Zones, Beyond the 60th degree of latitude only two seasons 
take pkce ; a long and severe winter is th^e suddc^y succeeded by insupportable heats. The 
rays of the sun, notwithstanding the obliquity of their direction, produce powerful effects, be- 
cause the great length of the days favors the accumulation of heat ; in three days the snow b 
dissolved, and flowers at once begin to Mow. 

7. Winds. Wind is a current of air moving in some particular direction ; the velocity and 
force of winds are irtirious. The following table shows the degrees of velocity of different winds. 

Velocity, â€” 4 or 5 miles an hour. Jfamt of the Wind. â€” Gentle wind, 
10 to 15 Brisk Gale, 

30 to 35 Hi^ wmd, 

50 Storm, 

80 to 100 Hurricane. 

The utility of winds is very great ; they ptnify the atmosphere, and dissipate the miasmata 
exhaled from marshes and stagnant waters. They raise and transport the clouds destined to 
fertilize the earth. Millions of seeds, furnished with little pinions, are scattered by them fin 
and wide, thus extending the empire of vegetation. They propel a vast deal of machinery, 
and transport ships from pole to pole on the great highway of nations. 

8. Permanent^ Periodical^ and Variable toinds. Winds may be divided into three class 
es ; permanent winds, or those which blow constantly in the same direction ; periodical winds, 
<n t}K>se which blow in one direction only a certain part of the year, and variable wbds, which 
are constantly changing their direction. 

9. Trade-mnds. The permanent winds blowing constantly between, and a few degrees 
beyond the tropics, from east to west, are called trade-mnds. They prevail in the Pacific, 
Atlantic, and parts of the Indian ocean, to about 30^ each side of the equator, being on the 
north a little from the northeast, and on the south from the southeast. In sailing, therefore, 
fetitk the Canaries to Cumana, or from Acapulco to the Philippines, the winds blow so steadily, 
that it is hardly necessary to touch the sails. 

10. Monsoons. In the Indian ocean to the north of 10^ S., and in the seas around Ma- 
laysia, there prevail periodical winds called monsoons, which blow half the year from one quar- 
ter, and the other half from the opposite direction ; at the time of their shifting or breaking iip. 
variable winds and violent storms prevail. On the north of the equator a southwest monsooo 
elows from April to October, and during the rest of the year a northeast monsoon ; ob the 
south of the equator a southeast wind prevails from April to October, and a northwest wind the 
other half of me year

1 1 . iMti and Sm Bntzti. Tbere is another kind of perioral trinds, commoa on ndnids 
â– Dd coists in tn>|Hcal countrias. During the day, when the air over the land is heated by the 
nin, a cool breeze sets in irom the sea ; this blows from about 10 A. M. to G P. M. At ni^t, 
on tbe coBtnry, a land-breeze prevails, that is, tbe wind sets off from the land till about 8 
A. M., when it dies awaj. 

12. Avnconei, Wkirlwinia, WdUrtpovU, &c. Hurricanes are violent storms of wind, 

blowing with great fury, often from 
opposite points of tne compass, 
ana causing dreadful devastaUons, 
They are rare beyond the tropics. 
"Whirlwinds are sometimes caused 
by two winds meeting, each from 
different directions, and then turn- 
ing rapidly round upon a centre ; 
and sometimes by the form of 
mountains, which occasions gusts 
of wind to descend with a spiral 
or whirling motion. Waterspouts 
which are met with at sea, and are 
dangerous to ships, have been sup- 
posed to be formed, by the raisbg 
up of wsler from the sea by whirl- 
winds. This opinion, however, 
WiuwnML seems to be doubtful ; for accord- 

ing to some observers, the water 
dischuged on the bursting of a waterspout is idways fresh, and therefore must have passed into 
tbe air in tbe form of vapor. The rimoom of the desert of Sahara, the lamitl of the Arabian 
deserts, the cAanueen of Kgjrpt, and tbe karmaltan of Guinea, the tolano of Spain, the sirocco 
of Italy, and the northwest wind of New South Wales, are noxious, hot winds, some of which 
aierely produce languor, while others, if admitted into tbe lungs, cause suffocation. 

13. Clavds. Every part of the land and water is constantly imparting to the atmosphraw 
portions of its substance, in the form of rapor. This is condensed by cold, and formed into 
imsts and clouds. In ascending to the summits of high mountains, the traveller sometimes passes 
dirough a zone of clouds, and beholds the extensive vapors of which it is composed stretched 
under bis feet, like a vast plain covered with snow. He wiU, however, discover other clouds 
ir above the tops of tbe loftiest peaks. There is no part of nature which more adorns the 
Bovene than tbe clouds. The beauty of their various tints, the variety of their forms, the 
saUimity of their .masses, the grandeur of their movements, are all calculated to affect the 
tmgTDation, and direct tbe attention to their great Author. 

The utility of the clouds is no less obvious than their' beauty. They scatter over tbe land 
tbe dew, rain, snow, and hail ; all of which contribute to refresh and fertilize Uie earth. We 
observe all nature to languish, when the clouds retain their stores too long ; plants fade and 
<tm>p ; animals feel their strength failing them ; man himself, breathing nothing but dust, can 
widi difficulty procure shdter from the sultry heat, by which his frame is parched and overpow- 
ered. No sooner has the water fallen from the clouds, than all living diings begin to revive, 
tbe fields resume their green attire, tbe flowers their lively tints, animals the sportive freedom 
of their motions, and the elements of tbe air their healthful equihbrium. 

Tbe association of certain forms of clouds with the state of the wetthÂ« has long been ob- 
KTved, and meteorologists have divided them into seven species : 1 The cimu, resembling a 
lock of hair of a feather ; it is high and indicates a breeze ; 2. The cumulvf, a dense cloud 
newer the earth, the prognostic of settied weather ; 3. The riratiu, a low, continuous, level 
sheet of cloud, indicative of serene weather ; 4. The cirro-cumtiint consists of dense rounded 
susses, at different heists, also a sign of fine weather ; 6. Tbe dm-^ratui is long and nar- 
tow, but changeable, often high, but descends to the earth as ^ soaking danse mist ; when 
stidmary it indicates -rcin or snow ; 6. The cvmulo-itratui, in which the cumulus is mixed 
with tbe cirro-stratus or cirro-cumulus ; the thunder-cloud is of this species ; 7. The mmfrtu 
is a shower seen in profile ; tha thunder-cloud, cw discharging its etectncity, generally passes 
Mo tbe nimbus.

14. Mirage. The mirage, or 
appeaiSDce of objects nhicn tre 
not actually in the horizon, or 
which exist there in a difiemu 
situation, is one of (he most re- 
markable of optical illusions. At 
sea, rocks and sands concealed 
under the water, appear as if thef 
were raised above the surface. 
The Swedish sailors long search- 
ed for a pretended magic island, 
which from lime to lime could be 
descried between the isle of Aland 
and the coast of Upland. It 
prored to be a rock, the image of 
which was presented in the air by 
die mirage. At one time the 
fata MoTgtMa. English saw with terror the coast 

of Calais and Bologne, in France, 
apparently approaching the shores of their island. Bat the mos| celebrated example of mirage 
is frequently exhibited tn the straits of Messina. The inhabitants, standing on the Italian side, 
perc&ive images of palaces, embattled ramparts, houses, and ships, and all the varied objects 
of towns and landscapes, in the air. This appearance is regarded by the people as the work 
of fairies, and is called Fata Morgana. 

15. Aurora BorealU. This phenomenon is 
commonly called the northern lights ; it is fre- 
(]ueatly to be seen in New England, and general^ 
in the north. It usually commences two or three 
hours after sunset, and consists of a whitish light, 
sometimes appearing and disappearing, and occa- 
sionally flashing nearly up to the zenith. Pre- 
vious to the war of the Revolution, these lights 
assumed a reddish hue, and were imagined to 
represent, in their bloody outlines, the marchmg 
of armies and the turmoil of battle. Id more 
northern regions they offer a more brilliant dis- 
play than in our country. Various esplanations 
are given of these remBrkab|e phenomena ; but

Vir. STRUCTURfi OF THE EARTH. MINERALS. 

I . Arrangement of the Materiab. Persons unaccustomed to examine the siruciure of the 
crust of the earth, are apt to ima^e that mineral masses present a confused heap of matter, 
without any particular order or arrangement. But wherever water- courses, artificial excava- 
tions, or precipices, expose the structure, we find striking proofs of the agency of causes tbit 
must have acted with great uniformity over vast portions of the surface, and that have produced 
a general resemblance between the structure of widely distant countries. Much of the materials 
is arranged in beds, of different extent and thickness, but indicating ilie operation of one com- 
mon agent. Such beds are termed Hrata, and the general fact is expressed by the term strati- 
fication. These strata sometimes consist of loose or slightly consolidated masses of clay or 
sand, and sometimes of hard, stony bodies, which are easily split ji ttie direction of the strata. 
The schists or slates are an example. Wherever natural or artificial sections lay open the 
earth's crust to a sufficient depth, we generally find the strata resting on a different kind of rock, 
which has no marks of a stratified structure. Hence the distribution of rocks into two great 
divisions, the stratified and the AtnHratiJied ; examples of the latter are granite, quartz, Ac- 
All of the unstrauGed and some of the stratified rocks have a granular or crystaline structure, 
which indicate that they have formerly been melted by the action of fire ; while the rr^lai 



im'HODucricw.

^tribuoott into layers or strata, shows that the masses so arranged have been formed b^ 
aqueous deposits, or the gradual throwing down of earthy particles from water. When the 
stratified rocks are crystalioe, we are led to infer that they have been, at least partially, melted 
by fire, since they were deposited by the waters in their existing order. All these processes 
may still be seen going on at the mouths of rivers, around springs, and in volcanic regions, but 
on B smaller scale than in former ages of die world. 

3. Organic lUmaint. Almost 
all the stratified rocks contain the 
remains of organic beings, animal 
or vegetable, or both, and it is in 
these relics of the past, that the 
geologist reads some portions, at 
least, of the former history of ihe 
earth, in periods long anterior to 
tradition, or even the existence ol 
man on this globe. Plants, shells, 
and corallines, were first noticed 
as entering into the composition 
of rocks, and next the remains of 
fishes and of other vertebrated 
animals, were distinctly recog- 
nised. These relics are some 
times of marine and sometimes of 
fresh-water origin, and sometimes 
are the productions of the land. 
The rocks, in which they are 
contained, and which are now 
often at great depths beneath the 
surface, â€” covered by a nu- 
merous series of strata, several 
thousand feet in thickness, - 
once formed the surface of the 
earth's crust ; the lower rocks in 
' the series will generally be found 
to contain marine remains ; the 
stratum above will, perhaps, con- 
tain fresh-water shells ; above this 
we shall perhaps find plants or the 
remains of huge saurians or lizards, 
indicadng vast swamps or marshes ; 
higher up we shall meet with quad- 
rupeds which occupied dry bnd ; 
in this way we may show that the 
spot in which these discoveries 
are made, has been successively 
the bottom of the sea, the bottom 
of a lake or river, a marsh or 
swamp, high and dry land. Some- 
times these remains alternate with 
each other, so that, for instance, 
the layers will present marine re- 
mains, then fresh water, then ma- 
rine again, then land, then marine 
or fresh water, and so on ; proving 
that the surface has been some- 
times raised and sometimes de- 
pressed, so as to emei^e from the 
ocean, become the habitation of 
other creatures, and aj^ain be nib

aiBigffd Inneith the watÂ«n. Is the lower strata of the aeries it is to be obserred, that irinle 
genara and species of sDimals are found which do not now exist id the known world, fan 
â– 3 we rise in the series, we find some genera, and at last some species, identical with thow 
now in existence. Yet eren these show great changes to bare taken place ; for it b am- 
mon to find the remains of tropical plants and animals beneath the surface of countries in which, 
on account of the coldness of the climate, they could not now live. 

3. ^ge of Rockt. The stratified rocks having been deposited from water, it is obrioai 
that the lowest in the series must hare been first deposited, or in other words are the tMtsi 
formations, and that the upper beds are the more recent. No such chronological data irc 
afforded by the unstratified rocks, though their relations to stratified materials afford just infe- 
rences respecting their true era. Thus if the latter are wholly below all the strau, we infer 
that they of course existed before any of the stratified rocks were deposited upon them ; but 
if they form lines penetrating some of the strata, and overlying them, then the latter bad 
assumed their present condition befwe the melted mass was poured into its actual positioD. 
Such lines of crystaline rock running through the stratified rocks, are called vtins or diket, and 
are of common occurrence. Superposition of strata is, then, the chief indication of the reli- 
tire age of rocks ; but as certain organic fossib hare been found to be peculiar to ceruin 
formations, it is often easy t6 identify particular rock-formalions by their mcluded organized 
remains, and when the order of superposition cannot be readily ascertained, the nature of these 
remains will serve to determine the geological age of the rocks. It is on such a basis that the 
receired geological classification of strata has been established ; and geologists usually divide 
them into three great classes, the primary, the secondary, and the tertiary. 

4. Primary Roekt. The j/rimary strata are such as do not include any organic bodies. 

They are the lowest in the series of 
strata, and are found to repose on 
crystaline unstratified rocks, general- 
ly on granite, which, as far as tbe 
crust has been penetrated, has the 
appearance of being the general fun- 
damental rock. The name primitwit 
was originally given to these rocb, 
because they were supposed to have 
been deposited before the creatiim of 
organized bodies ; but this cannot be 
proved, since the cause which cryi- 
talized them, or their fusion, maj 
'- have occasioned the disappearance m 

organic remains. 

6. Secondary Rocki. The Hcondary strata are generally less crystaline in structure, lad 
in their lower beds the organic remains are few, being chiefly marine productions ; but these 
increase in number and variety io the upper beds, which end with the chalk formation. The 
organized bodies are chiefly marine productions, as zoophytes, Crustacea, shells, and fishes ; 
reptiles, amphibious animals, and plants, are also found in secondary strata. During the depo- 
siuoQ of the secondary strata the land appears to have been gradually rising above the level d 
the waters which once covered it ; and during the same period there are marks of more sudden 
changes or disturbances of the strata, which appear to have been owing to the forcible imip- 
tion of melted rocks from the bowels of the earth. 

6. Ttrtiary Rocks. Above the cretaceous or highest secondary strata, another system of 
deposits appears, which has received the name of Uie tertiary strata. These have' been in 
part deposited from fresh water, by which circumstance and by their organic remains they are 
distinguished from the secondary strata. There are, indeed, some fresh-water animals found 
m the latter, but these are rare, and the formations that include them, seem to have been made 
in the estuaries of great rivers. But decided alternations of fresh and salt water deposits are 
characteristic of the tertiary period. All the fossils of the secondary rocks belong to ezliact 
species, and are distinct from those of the tertiary strata. In the latter, mammaUa first appear, 
and there are a few species identical with those now existing. 

7. Dilmial Formatitm. In many' countries vast tracts are covered with a confused misi 
of water-wcffn rocks, gravel, and a mixture of other fragmentary substances, which completely 



hvy and hide (rem sight the more coasolidated and regubr raiases above deacnbed. The 
locks 109 rounded, their sharp edgei having been evidently worn off by fricttoD, and the earthy 
materials have as evidently been produced by the grindiog dowo of the rocky fragments, durii^ 
the aaioe process. Eveiything here bears the mark of the action of powerful floods of water, 
which have swept away and ground up or rounded the iiragments of native rock ; as this forma 
tioo i) die effect of some great deluge, it is called the diluvial formation. Sometimes the 
BMSses which have been moved in ibis manner from their native beds are of ^ea( size, and il 
ii possible to trace the direction of the diluvial current by ascertaining their original situation. 
By tkis process it is shown that such a flood has swept over the United States from northwest 
to southeast, scattering over the surlace immense numbers of those lost rocks or traveUrif as 
they are often called by the people, or bowlders or trralic bUicIa, as the geologists term them, 
10 distinguish them from rocky masses in place, that is, in their native beds. 

8. Cavern*. Fissures and cavities are some^mes found of great extent, forming vast caverns 

in the bowels of the earth, which 
are either empty or filled with water. 
Instances of these on a great scale 
occur in the limestoue strata of 
many countries, especially of Car- 
niola aod the United States. The 
cavera of Adelsbe^, in Camitda, 
extends several leagues in iu va- 
rious branches, and contains a sub- 
terraoean lake and river ; the nol 
less remarkable Mammoth cave of 
Kentucky has been traced several 
miles, and is also in limestone. 
. Some of these caves are brilliantly 
ornamented with crystals of every 
shape and hue ; such is Weyer'i 
cave, in Virginia, which consists of 
numerous large apartments and gal- 
leries filled with stalactites, or crys- 
taline masses resembling various 
natural and artificial objects. The 
celebrated spar cave, of the Isle 
of Skye, is in sandstone ; there is 
also one in a slaty rock in the island 
of Thermic, and the great Icelandic 
cave of Surtshellir is in lava. This 
last is nearly a mile m length, and 
appears to have been formed io 
â–¡owmg lava by the disengagement 
of gaseous matters, as it has all 
the appearance of being the con- 
sequence of an enormous air-bub- 
ble, having its roof ornamented 
with projections of black slag. The 
celebrated Columnar cave on the 
FWaj'* cwh Stafa. 'sle of Staffa, well known as Fin* 

gal's cave, is in trap-rock. 

9. JffintraU. Minerals are divided into four classes ; acidiferous, earthy, inflammahle, and 
aetaUic. 

Of the first class, we may notice limestone, calcareous spar, or carbonate of lime, that u, 
lune combined with carbonic acid. It is the most abundant of aiiy known mineral substance 
00 the earth. It is one of the principal constituents of rocks. It is also found in its pure 
ibte in immense beds or banks ; of stratified earth it forms more than half. It is also founrf 
combined with clay, and thus constitutes the various marls. It forms vast beds, in the sb^ 
of didk, mingled with large masses of shells.

Carbonate of fime, confusedly crystaUzed, forms a common species of buSding stone in some 
countries. When it possesses a finer grain, it forms marble of no great value. As it becomes 
harder and more refined, it is better adapted for sculpture, and is then properly called marble 
White statuary marble from Carrara, in Italy, is esteemed most valuable, and the purest of any. 
It must be observed, that some kinds of marble are primary and others secondary. There is 
a fine species of clouded marble found near Middlebury, Vermont. White m^le is foimd 
in Stockbridge and Pittsfield, Massachusetts, and Washington, Connecticut, and in many other 
States. A beautiful species, variegated with green, yellow, and black, is found at Milford, near 
New Haven, Connecticut. In Pennsylvania, several kinds of marble are found, some of which 
appear to be of primary formation. On the banks of the Potomac, a fine kind of secondary 
marble, called Breccia, is obtained. The superb pillars which support the dome of the Rep 
resentatives' chamber in the capitol at Washington, are of this species. Variegated marble is 
found at Thomaston, in Maine. 

Of the second class, or earthy minerals, quartz may be mentioned as one of the most con- 
spicuous. It is everywhere a common stone, and b frequently denominated white flint. Gravel 
and sand are composed of this mineral. Sometimes it is found in regular crystals, and is then 
called rock crystal. When transparent it is esteemed very beautiful ; and is used for various 
ornaments. These crystals, when colored, take the name of the precious stones they resem* 
ble, and great deception is sometimes practised in making them pass for real gems. 

Of this class of minerals, are also the precious stones, which are almost entirely composed 
of argil, or pure clay. Among the most valuable of these are the ruby, sapphire, emerald, and 
topaz. The finest rubies and sapphires are found in India and the bland of Ceylon. The 
most beautiful emeralds are obtained in Peru. The most valuable topazes come fix)m Brazil. 

Feldspar, also belonging to the second class of minerals, forms the base of a multitude of 
rocks. The whitish particles observed in granite are feldspar, which constitutes two thirds of 
Its substance. Extensive mountains are in some mstances solely composed of it. It some- 
times occurs in large masses, beautifully colored, and is used for various ornaments. It is found 
more frequently in the mountains of Asia than in those of Europe. America affords it in large 
quantities. 

Mica consists of thin scales of a metallic brilliancy. It forms a part of the substance of 
granite, and may be recognised by its sparkling surface. It is also mixed in other rocks, and 
constitutes a portion of almost every soil. It sometimes occurs in large plates, and is often 
called isinglass. It is found in Russia, Siberia, and Soongaria, in large masses, the leaves being 
sometimes several feet square. In Russia it is used in windows instead of glass. 

Asbestos, a celebrated mineral, is chiefly found in the fissures and cavities of pnmitive rocks, 
of which it seems to be a decomposition. A detached tuft of this mineral can hardly be imagin- 
ed, at first sight, not to be a bunch of fine white silk. The ancients made towels, napkins, and 
head-dresses of it. When these became soiled by use, they were thrown into the fire, and 
upon being taken out were found to be whiter than if they had been washed. This mineral 
abounds in Corsica, in the Uralian mountains, and in Greenland. The longest that has. been 
found came from the Pyrenees. 

Of the third class of minerals, or inflammable substances, we may first notice sulphur, which 
is discovered in various situations. . It occurs at the mouths of volcanoes, in the form of pow- 
der, and sometimes in crystals. It is also found in veins or beds, among sulphate of lime and 
potter's clay. In this latter situation it is chiefly obtained. Bitumen, in a liquid state, called 
mineral tar or naphtha, filters through the earth and rocks, and sometimes floats on the water 
like oil. There are springs of it in Persia. In Parma, in Italy, it is drawn up from wells sunk 
in the earth for the purpose. It is called asphaltum, and gives name to Lake Asphaltites, or 
the Dead Sea, in Syria. In Persia, Japan, and other countries, it is used for lamps. In 
Auvergne, in France, glutinous bitumen covers the earth, and sticks to the feet so as to impede 
the traveler. 

Pit coal is of two kmds, bituminous and anthracite. The former bums most freely, and is 
most common. Of this kind are the coal mines in England. This coal consists of bitumen 
united to an earthy base, and is supposed to be formed of vegetable and animal remains, long 
since deposited in the earth, where, by a process of nature, they have assumed their present 
form. Anthracite coal consists of carbon accidentally mixed with flint and iron. Of this 
ppecies are the Lehigh and Schuylkill mines in Pennsylvania. 

Carbon exists in nature to a great extent. It enters into the composition of a multitude of 



introduction; Â« 41 

, and constitutes a chief ingredient of animal and vegetable matter. Common 
cfatrcod consists almost entirely of carbon. The diamond, the most precious of all minerals, 
k pnre carbon. It has been ascertained, by repeated experiments, that the diamond is com- 
plelely combustible. This, as well as ihe other fine gems, is found chiefly in South America 
and in India. It is remarkable, that the precious stones, as well as the precious metals, are con- 
fined cbiedy to equatorial regions. Amber must be regarded as a mineral, though it seems to 
be I resinous gum, produced by trees. It is chiefly found in the countries bordering qd the 
souihern part of the Baltic Sea. It was formerly taken by the fishermen, in nets, but is dow 
procured by digging in the hills of sand along the coast. The largest piece ever obtained 
wdgbed I3| pounds, and is preserved in the royal museum of Berlin. 

The fourth class of minerals comprehends the metals. Flatina, the heaviest of these, and 
even more valuable than gold itself, is found in the gold mines of America, and in the Ural 
momiiains. It has been obtained only In small quantities, but has been coined in Russia. 
Some gold is found in Norway and Sweden. The gold mines of Hungary are more pro- 
ductive ; but all the gold mines of Europe are trifling in comparison with those of South 
America. These mines we shall notice elsewhere, as well as tliose of Mesico. Gold, in 
connderable quantities, is found in tlie Southern States. The islands of Borneo, of Ce- 
lebes, and of Sumatra, situated under the equator, contain very rich mines of this metal. 
Noriy all the rivers of Africa bring down with them particles of it, mixed with the sand. 
Cpon the coast of Guinea, it is said, that one person may pick up several ounces In a day. 
SOver B foÂ«md in various forms, but most commonly mixed with arsenic, In the state of 
ofB, There are mines in Siberia, Norway, Saxony, the Hartz Mountains, and other places 
in Europe ; but the amount of silver obtained from them is small. The silver mines of Fotosi, 
once the most prolific in the world, are now exhausted. Peru, and many other parts of South 
America, abound in silver. Mexico has produced annually more than 30,000,000 of dollars. 
Mecmy is foimd in small quantities, both in America, and in Europe. This metal requires so 
irtde brat for its fusion, that It always remains in a liquid state in our climate. In the arctic 
repoos it becomes solid ; it is then almost as malleable as tin. 

Lead is generally found mineralized by sulphur, forming an ore called galena, which is almost 
ilwiys mixed with iron, with antimony, and especially with silver. Lead Is not found in abun- 
<lÂ»ce anywhere in the north of Europe or Asia. It exists In great quantities In Germany, France. 
ittJ England. The lead mines of Missouri, Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin, are elsewhere de- 
Knbed. Copper is an abundant mineral, and Is found In alt parts of the world. Tin abounds 
in Cornwall, in England. It is also found in Saxony, but scarcely ever in other parts of Eu- 
rope. America and Africa produce little of it. It is found in Hin^oostan, Malacca, and the 
tsnds of Sumatra and Japan. Iron is extensively distributed throughout the earth. The 
nxnmtuns of Norway and Sweden contain immense quantities of it. In the southern part of 
Sweden and in Missouri are mountains composed entirely of iron ore. I'he north of Asia 
iboonds In iron. Souihern Africa, all parts of the United States, and Canada, are also pro- 
rated vrith ample stores of this useful metal. 



DTTRODUCTION. 



VTII GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF PLANTS. 



IVttpicaJ VtftUlim. 

1. Diffusumof Vtgtttttum. Tbe geographical distributioa of vegeuble forma is cmeflj 
affected by climate, including under this head noi only temperature and moisture, but de- 
gree of light, and density or rarity of the air, and by soil. We God, indeed, traces of vege- 
Ution in the deptha of the ocean, in dark caverns, in the hot waters of thermal springs, on the 
loftiest mountains, and even in the bosom of perpetual snow ; but these are comparatively 
isre and feeble, and the full vigor and glory of vegetable life appear only where it is unfolded 
under favorable influences. Ld regard to temperature it will be found, that the distribution of 
heat, rather than its d^ee, has the greatest influence upon vegetation; the growth of plants 
which require a long and moderate heat, depends on the average summer temperature ; tliat 
of those which require a ehort but great heat, on the temperature of the warmest month, and 
that of those which are unable to resist a considerable cold, on the temperature of the coldest 
month. Thus many of the fruits of southern Europe cannot be raised to 'advantage in some 
parts of the United States, because tbe plants are killed by the frosts, although tbe length and 
warmth of tbe summer are sul^cient to ripen their fruits. So maize or Indian com and tobac- 
co are produced in some parts of America whose winters are excessively severe, becatise the 
genial heats of a short summer are more favorable to their maturity than the lunger and milder 
summers of Europe. Some plants require much moisture, but dso need the strong light and 
heat of a clear sun, and will not thrive in the cloudy climates, where a serene sky is almotii 
unknown. Sandy or siliceous soils are necessary for some vegetables, and calcareous ingre- 
dients are equally essential to others. 

3. J^umbtr and Dittribuiion of Species. Each plant has generally a determinate climate to 
which it is best adapted ; there are other climates, however, m which it can be raised, though 
less advantageously, but beyond certain limits it ceases to grow altogether. The whole number 
of species at present known amounts to 50,000, but it is estimated that the total number of 
existing species is upwards of 100,000. 

Tbe most simply organized plants, such as mosses, lichens, grasses, &c, which form the 
lowest order of the vegetable creation are the most widely diffused ; the more perfect tribes 
are in general limited to particular regions, and, in some cases, as for example, the cedar of 
Lebanon, to a particular mountain or district. 

3. Vegetation of the Frigid Zones. There are properly no plants which are peculiar to 
the frigid zone, because the mountains of the torrid zone, embracing every variety of climaU- 
between their base and summit, are capable of producing all the vegetables of the temperate 
and fiigid regions. The number of v^etable species in the frigid zone is Â«mall ; the trees are 



nmoDCCTicaf. M 

few and dwbifish, Bud, as we 
adrance tdwards the polea, fi- 
nally disappear. But mosset, 
licbeos, fems, creeping plants, 
and some borry-beariDg siini>s, 
tlirive during the short sum- 
mer. 

4. VegetiOion of the Tempe- 
rate Zones. In tbe high kili- 
tudes are the pine and tbe fir, 
which retain their verdure dur- 
ing tbe rigors of winter. To 
these, on approaching the equa- 
Farint UndM ef Mosiat, tor, succeed the oak, elm, 

beecb, lime, and other forest 

ireei. Several fruit-trees, among which are tbe apple, the pear, tbe cherry, and the plum, grow 

better io tbe higher latitudes ; while to tbe regions nearer the tropics belong the obve, lemon, 

orange, and Gg, the cedar, cypress, and cork-tree. 
Between 3()Â° and 50Â° is the counUy of the vine and the mulberry ; wheat grows in 60^, and 

otu and barley a few degrees further. Maize and rice are the grains more commonly cultivated 

IB lover latitudes. 

5. Figetalion of the Torrid Zone, Tbe vegetation of the torrid zone, where nature sup- 
[dies most abundantly moisture and beat, is the most remarkable for its luxuriance and the variety 
of ita species. Tbe most Juicy fruits and the most powerful aromatics, the most magnificent 
ad gigantic productions of the vegetable crea^on, are foimd in tbe intertropical regions. There 
die euth yields the sugar-cane, tbe cofiee-tree, the palm, tbe bread-tree, the immense baobab, 
(be date, tbe cocoa, the cinnamon, tbe nutmeg, the pepper, tbe camphor-tree, &c., with so 
nnny dye-woods and medicinal plants. At different elevations of soli, the torrid zone exhibits, 
in addition to its peculiar forms, all the productions of tbe other regions of tbe earth. 

6. Vegetation of Northern Hemisphere. The northern hemisphere, wiib which we are best 
icquainted, is divided by Humboldt into 6 bands, as follows : Ist band has a mean temperature 
ihore 77^^ Pahr. and may be considered tbe natural region of palms, tbe banana, and the coiTee- 
tree. It extends northward hi the old continent to 32Â° N. lat., and in the new to 23Â° 30'. 
3d bud, with a mean temperature ranging between 77Â° and 68Â°, is the proper regym of tbe 
citron and its varieties. In the old continent it reaches to 37Â° or 38Â° N. lat. ; in ibe new to 
39^. 3d band, with a mean temperature from 68Â° to 59Â°, is the true region of the olive and 
dw vine, exteotUng to 43Â° 30* in tbe old worid, and in eastern Asia and tbe new, to 33Â° or 
33^. 4tb band, with a mean temperature from 59Â° to 50Â°, produces tbe vine, and in perfec- 
don the oak and wheat. In Europe it extends to 53Â° 35', in America and eastern Asia to 40Â° 
N. ht 5th band, with a mean temperature from 50Â° to 41Â°, is the region of the various cer- 
catit, and of forests of Quercus robur. In Europe it extends to 60Â° N. lat , in America to 
ibcnt 50Â°. â‚¬th band, with a mean temperature from 41Â° to 33Â°, is the native region of tbe 
pbe, the bircb, and the willow. In its lowest parallels, and of Alpine plants, lichens, and byssi, 
mdie b^er ; it reaches to the limits of perpetual irost, extending, in Europe, to 71Â° N. lat.. 
n Asia, to the Arctic circle, and, in eastern America, to about 60Â°. 

IX. GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF ANIMALS. 

1. AntnaU. Tbe animal kingdom presents a vast and varied field, at which we can only 
CM I glance. Every department of nature, ibe earth, air, and sea, is full of animated beings : 
Kline o( them seem nearly allied to vegetables and minerals. From these, we may ascend in 
dw scale, through an a.mo5t infinite series of existences, up to man, who constitutes the highest 
m tbe animal kingdom. Among the most remarkable animals, we may mention the coral in- 
Kcts which are chiefly found in the equatorial regions. These creatures, so minute as scarcely 
to be perceived by the naked eye, exist in the sea, in such inconceivable numbers, and labor 
*idi such activity, as to construct vast beds of coral, which at length raise tbelr tops above the 
' I islands are graduallv buih in the bosom of the ocean, by insignificaul 



4A B?TRODUCTKaT. 

Wherever man has not dramed the marshes, and cleared ihe forests, insects reign with resist' 
less sway. History has recorded several examples of Iowds and countries rendered miuihabi 
table by the multitudes of bees, wasps, and gnats. Armies and whole tribes have been com- 
jpelled to fly before these feeble creatures, rendered invincible by their numbers. 

Id Asia and Africa, there is a remarkable animal of the ant kind, called termites, or White 

Ants. When they find their 
way into houses, nothing less 
hard than metal or glass es 
capes their ravages. Their 
favorite food is wood, and 
such is the multitude of the 
assailants, and such the ex- 
cellence of their tools, that 
all the timber-work of a spa- 
cious apartment is often de- 
stroyed by them in a single 
I night. Outwardly every thing 
appears as if untouched, but 
; they destroy first llie inside, 
and conceal their operations

with a coat of clay. 
Fishes, though generally confined to the sea, sometimes forsake their native element. In the 
West Indies, there is a kind of walking fish, which takes to the land, and throws itself along by 
jerks, in this way traveling considerable distnnces. The flying-fish skims through the air ; eels 
traverse the meadows ; and, on the coast of Coromandel, there is a kind of perch that climb . 
palm-trees.

The alligator and crocodile, as well as other lizards, are mostly found in or near tropical 
countries. The largest serpents are also confined to these regions. 



INTBODUCmON. 



Varima kiruU ^ Birdt. 

The Condor seldom forsakes the Cordilleras of Mexico, and the Andes, though he Is some* 
limes found in the Rocky Mountains. Vultures, whose office it is to prevent contagion, by 
roDoriDg animal remains in hot countries, abound in tropical climates. The bird of paradise 
is found only in New Guinea and the adjacent regions. Parrots and paroquets are natives of 
trarm latitudes. The ostrich is found only in Africa and Arabia. The cassowary is found 
only io Java and the Asiatic Islands ; the emeu in New Holland. The rhea, sometimes called 
iIm ostrich, is found in the southern part of South America. It is remarkable, that nearly 
iQ ibe land birds of America are of difierent species from those of the other continent : about 
SO species of water birds common to the United States, are also found ii^ Europe. 

Among the quadrupeds which are distributed 'nearly oveiUhe surface of the earth, we may 
meatioD the dog, cow, sheep, goat, horse, ass, pig, and cat, in a domestic state . in a wild 
state, the fox, bear, hare, rabbit, stag, deer, squirrel, rat, mouse, and ermine. Tlio dog, the 
raithful companion of man, has followed him into every climate. In many countries, he is the 
only domestic animal, and supplies the place of the horse apd ox. Toward the equator, as 
ffell IS It the pole, he loses his voice, and his harking degenerates into a kind of growling noise. 

Among quadrupeds confined to the cold parts of the northern hemisphere, we may enumer- 
Ue (be reindeer, musk ox, white. bear, polar fox, otter, beaver, martin, and lynx. The camel 
with two humps, lives as far north as the 52d degree of north latitude, and seems to have been 
brought originally from BactrJana, or Great Bucharia, in Asia. The camel with one hump, or 
(be dromedary, appears to have come from Arabia and Africa, and is used in those countries, 
â– ad generally in the southern parts of Asia. The chamois prefers the mountains of the tem- 
perate zone. There are various kinds of antelopes, some of which remain in warm, and others 
in cold regions. The hyena and jackal live near the equator. Most of the quadrupeds of 
America are peculiar species, not found in the other continent. 

AiDoi^ the animals confined to tropical countries, we may notice apes, monkeys, and baboons. 
Tlie ^rafie, zebra, hippopotamus, and rhinoceros, belong to the warm regions of Africa. The 
eieploDts of Asia and Africa are different races. Those of Afiica do not advance furthei 
Dortb than the 20th degree of north latitude. The Asiatic elephant inhabits only India, Chiga 
B iar north as the 30th degree, and some of the Asiatic Islands, to which it has been trans- 
ported by man. Afiica has always been the most celebrated country for lions. They are 
Iwnd in nearly all parts of it. Those which rove in the burning plains south of the Atlas 
MouDiains, are distinguished for strength and fierceness. The lions of Asia are inferior to 
ibose of Africa. They are also less abundant, and seem only to be found in the deserts of 
â– \nbii, in Hindostan, and perhaps in some of the Asiatic islands. 

. The royal tiger, which is the largest species, is confined to Hindostan, the Birman empire, 
â– nd Ibe ishnds of Ceylon and Sumatra. The true tiger is not found in Africa. The pantbdl 
â– d.leopud are. found in Africa atone.

2. dumber and Distribution of Species, The number of species in the animal kbgdom 
has been estimated at about 100,000. Each genus is generally confined to a particular regioo 
or climate, and where the same genus is found in different continents the species are different. 
Most of the domestic animals (the horse, cow, dog, sheep, goat, hog, and cat) thrive in nearly 
every variety of climate, although some of them become more or less degenerate in high lati- 
tudes. The camel and the elephant on the contrary cannot be naturalized in the colder cilmates. 

3. Zoological Regions. The earth appears to be divided into at least eleven zoological 
regions or districts, of which each is the residence of a distinct set of animals ; 

(I.) The Arctic region contains several tribes common to the eastern and western con- 
tinents, a circumstance owing doubtless to the communication between them afforded by means 
of ice. (2.) The temperate regions of the eastern continent are inhabited by peculiar races, 
quite distmct from the kindred tribes of the (3.) corresponding zone in the American continent. 
The equatorial region contains four extensive tracts, widely separated from each other by seas, 
and each peopled by distinct races ; these are (4.) the mtertropical parts of Asia ; (5.) those 
of Africa ; (6.) those of America ; (7.) the islands which constitute Malaysia ; and (8.) Pa 
pua and the surrounding islands. (9.) The extensive region of New Holland forms a distinct 
soological province, inhabited by several very singular tribes ; and the southern extremities (10.) 
of America, and (11.) of Africa, separated from the northern temperate re^ns of their re- 
pective continents by the heats of the torrid zone, are each distinguished by peculiar races. 

4. Antmals of Islands. The animals of idands situated near continents are m general the same 
m those of the neighboring mainland. Small idands lying at a ereat distance from contiiieiits wn^ 
nearly or quite destitute of quadrupeds, except such as appear to nave been carried to them 1^ mSB.

X. MAN. 



1. Mm, ai birdt the most helpless of animals and seemingly the most exposed to the acci> 
dents of Dature, is yet the most universal and mdepei\dent of the animal creation. Gifted frith 
ibe diviae powers of reason and speech, he is separated by a wide gulf from the mere animal 
nature ; yet phTsically considered be stands at the head of the animal kingdom. The buman 
nee forms but one species ; yet exhibits those physical diversities which constitute varieties. 

2. Forietiu of the Human Race. The physical differences which exist in the human 

TffniiftUFitaRaetat^Mtm. family, are diversity of com- 

plexion ; difference of stature 
and shape ; varieties of form 
in tbe skull ; color and nature 
of the hair ; Sic. Some naf- 
uralists, taking complezioo as 
the basis of their division, dis 
tinguish the human face into 
three varieties; 1. the white 
or Caucasian ; 2. the yellow 
or Mongolian ; and 3. tbe 
black or Ethiopian. Others 
adopt the form of tbe skull as 
tlie characteristic, and make 
five varieties ; 1 . the Cauca- 
sian, including tbe European 
nations and some of the West- 
em Asiatics, in which tbe 
bead is almost round, the face 
oval, and tbe features not very 

firominent ; 3. Tbe Mongo- 
ian, in which tbe bead is 
ahnost square, the cheek-bones 
prominent, and the face broad 
and flattened ; 3. The Ethio- 
pian or Negro, in which the 
head is narrow, tbe forehead 
convex, tbe nostrils wide, the' 
jaws lengthened, the lower 
part of tbe face projecting, the 
nose spread and 'flat, and the 
lips thick ; 4. Tbe American, 
io which the cheek-bones are 
prominent, tbe face broad, the 
forebead low, and tbe eyes 
deeply seated ; 5. And the 
Malay, in which the forehead 
is slightly arched, the upper 
jaw projectmg, and the featuref 
m many respects approachine 
those of the eecond and fourtn 
varieties.

Of these five races the Caucasian deserves to be considered the first. Not only is the 
*^nniteiiance more beautiful, but the intellectual and moral endowments of this race are of a 
l^dwr character. Whenever they have met with the other races, they have ultimately pre- 
'md. Tbey have excelled all others m literature sad the arts, and seem to have given birth 
to OM of the valuable institutions of human setdetr.

3. Languages, Some writers have endeavored to arrange the human tribes into classes or 
families, according to the relations of their languages ; comprising under the name of family 
those nations whose languages are closely connected in grammatical structure or in the etymol- 
ogy of their roots. Thus the German, Swedish, Danish, Dutch, and English languages bear 
a close resemblance to each other, and the nations speaking those languages are considered as 
kindred tribes, forming a family of nations to which has been given the name of the Teutonic 
family. The whole number of known languages is about 2,000. Of these fifteen are spoken 
or understood over a wide extent of country or by a great number of individuals : viz. the 
Chinese, Arabic, Turkish, Persian, Hebrew, Sanscrit, German, English, French, Spanish, 
Portuguese, Russian, Greek, Latin, and Malay. 

4. Population of the Globe, Very different estimates have been made of the entire popu- 
lation of the globe ; a regular enumeration has been made only in a few states, and the whole 
number of individuals in some has been calculated from a consideration of the known number 
of males, or of men capable of bearing arms, or of taxable polls, &c. But these data are 
not possessed in regard to many countries, and there are extensive regions of the world quite 
unknown to us. Accordingly the most trustworthy estimates of late writers differ considerably 
on this subject, some calculating the number of individuals of the human race at 1,000 millions, 
and others at 650 or 700 millions. Supposing the population of the globe to be rather less 
than 750 millions, the following table exhibits an estimate of its distribution in the five great 
divisions, of the world.

XI. POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS. 

1. Origin of Government. Let us for a moment go back to the very infancy of socie^i 
and trace its progress in the formation of government. The ties which unite husband and wile. 



INTRODUOTI<Â»^. i|9 

MMra and cbildrÂ«i, formed the iaikiily, or domestic circle. Those &milie& diat happtn to 
live in the same neighborhood, after quarreling for a while, at last agree to live in harmony 
together ; certain rules become established among them, which for a time are only considered 
customs. The union of these families does not form a state, but only a civil society. These 
small societies soon perceive, that their customs and observances require to be clearly ex- 
pressed, and to be invested with the authority of laws. Men of superior capacity become the 
lawgivers of these hamlets or villages. As soon as the rights and duties of individuals become 
thus established, political society commences. 

But this is a community without efficient government. They have laws ; but these, in order 
to render them effectual, require some power to execute them. The want of this power leaves 
society a prey to anarchy and confusion. The experience of these evils teaches mankind to 
establish some system, by which laws shall not only be framed, but enforced. Such a system 
is government, and when once established in a community, that community becomes a king- 
dom, empire, or republic, according to the particular form of government that is adopted. 

In the earliest state of society, the patriarch or head of a family is naturally regarded as its ruler. 
Thus the patriarchal form is used in the infancy of society. In time of war, the strongest and 
most sagacious leader naturally assumes tlie principal authority and becomes the ^ chief. As 
society advances and the nation increases in number and weahh, the chief assumes the rank and 
authority of a prince or king. A prince of a warlike disposition conquers the adjacent coun- 
tries, and, ruling over several nations, becomes an emperor. Convinced, by experience and 
observation, that monarchical forms of government are not adapted to promote the highest 
happiness of the people, the inhabitants of a country throw off the yoke of tyranny, and frame 
a system, in which the authority shall be placed in the hands of persons chosen, from time to 
time, by themselves, thus giving rise to a free government. 

2. Goveminefii. The government of a state is the body or bodies of men, to which are 
intrusted the power of making and executing the laws, the management of the public concerns, 
and the defence and promotion of the genera] welfare. 

3. Powen and Branches of Crovemment, The most important powers of a government 
are, that of making laws, or the kgislative power ; that of interpreting or applying them to 
individual cases, or the judicial power ; and that of executing them, or the executive power 
Each of these powers is, in many states, confided to a distinct body, and the government is, 
therefore, divided into three independent branches, the legislature, the judiciary, and the 
etecutive. 

4. Forms of Gotemment. There are various forms of government differing in their cbarac 
ter and appellation, according to the disposition of the powers of government in few or many 
iiands, and the organization of the different branches ; 

(1.) A monarchical government is one in which the supreme power is exercised by a single 
individual ; if the sovereign succeeds his predecessor by right oi inheritance, it is a hereditaiy 
monarchy ; if he is chosen by the nation, or certain privileged classes, or dignitaries, it is atn 
elective monarchy ; 

(2.) When the sovereign has no law but his own will, and can dispose at pleasure of the 
lives, persons, and property of his subjects, the government is a despotism ; il the sovereign 
unites allpowers in himself, but is bound by the laws, the government is an absolute monarchy ; 

(3.) When the authority of the head of the state is restricted by the conciu-rent authority of 
the representatives of the nation or of certain privileged classes of the nation, the govemmelit 
IS called a limited or constitutional monarchy ; 

(4.) A republican government is one in which the supreme power is in the hands of the 
<^bole body of the people, or is exercised by the principal citizens ; in the former case> it is 
cidled a democracy or democratic republic ; in the latter an aristocracy or aristocratic republic ; 

(5.) States are also differently denomraated according to the title of the sovereign, without 
reprd to the form of government ; thus a monarchy is styled an empire, kmgdom, duchy, 
priactpality, electorate, landgraviate, &;c., according as the head of the state bears the title 
of emperor, king, duke, prince, elector, landgrave, &c. ; 

(6.) Of the popular form of government, that of the United States furnishes the leading 
example. This is founded upon the theory, that the true end and first object of government 
should be to secure the highest happmess of the people, and that the surest mode of accom- 
pfishing this end, is to mtrust the government to the people. It may safely be asserted, that 

7 



fO INTRODDCTION 

BO couDtiy on (he earth enjoys so mucli freedom, so equal a disttibution of rights and priTilegei, 
whb so little confusion and anarchy, as our own. 

The other republican governments which now exist, some of them ostensibly modeled after I 
our own, exert by no means so happy an influence. It is obvious, that a popular governtnau ! 
mist be good or bad, according to ihe character of the people from whom it flows. Wise 
laws cannot be framed by the ignorant. Free institutions cannot proceed from slaves. An 
upright, virtuous, and just administration cannot be expected, where tlie people are vicious and 
debased. Let us draw this lesson from the spectacle exhibited by the other republics, thai t 
form of government, however good, will not secure the happiness of a people, unless they are 
wise and virtuous, and choose the wise and virtuous to admmister it. 

5. Coloniea. CoUmiM are estabUshments founded by states, or sometimes by individuals, 
in foreign countries, for commercial or benevolent purposes ; and subject to the authority of 
the mother country. Factories are tradmg stations established in foreign countries. Colonies 
founded by the transportation of convicted criminals are called penal coloniet. 

6. Tount. CititM. VillagtB. The name of town or city, strictly speaking, is not ^ven 

to a collection of houses on account either of 
its extent or population, but in consequence of 
certain privileges which the place enjoys. A 
city has a local government, at the head of 
which is a mayor, or other officer, to regulate 
its internal affairs. It has also a court, police, 
and system of local laws. 

A town has also some privileges, such as the 
right to enact certain by-laws appertaining to 
the place ; or laying taxes for the support of 
the poor, for the mamtenance of schools, and 
for various other purposes. 

Vill^es are generally mere collections of 

houses. In different countries, cities and 

towns have different privileges, and these termi 

Wathagum. are, of course, used with various significations. 

It may be remarked, that the great cities of 

Europe surpass our own in population and the splendor of their public edifices. The cities 

of Africa aud Asia, though many of them very populous, are inferior both to those of Europe 

and America, in beauty, comfort, and convenience. A lai^e proportion of the houses are of 

mud ; the streets are generally narrow, gloomy, and without pavements, and the houses low, 

with flat roofs. In Persia, and parts of India, there are some gorgeous palaces, which have 

a cenain degree of magnificence ; but they cannot compare with those of Europe for beauty 

and elegance. 

XII. RELIGION. 

1. Varieties of Retigious Sifsttmt. All the various religious systems, professed by different 
nations, may be reduced to two great classes ; the one comprising those which acknowledge the 
existence of a Supreme God, the Creator, Preserver, and Ruler of all things, and the other in- 
cluding those which do not recognise the existence of a Supreme Intelligence. 

2. Fitichism. Sabeism. To the latter class belong (he innumerable forms of superstition 
which prevail among ignorant and barbarous tribes. FeticMsm is the worship of fetiches, that 
is, of various living or inanimate objects of nature ; the elements, rivers, fire, trees, and what- 
ever else the credulous savage sees endowed with powers of good or evil, become the objects 
of gratitude or fear and worship. Different forms of fetichism prevail among the negro tribes 
of Africa, in Australia, Polynesia, and in some parts of Asia and America. The sacrifice 
of human victims often forms a part of its horrid rites. Sabeitm is the worship of the 

. heavenly bodies, the sua, moon, and stars ; this is ao ancient form of religious fiuih, but has 
ceased to prevail very extensively. 

3. Judaitm. Judaism acknowledges no revelaUon, but that made to the Hebrews b? 
Moses and the prophets. The Jews are the descradants of the ancient Hebrews, and 



INTHODUCnON. Jg] 

though dispersed over all parts of tbe world, they preserve their ceremonies and frith. 
Tbeir stored books are the books of the Old TestameDt, written originally in Hebrew ; they 
stiti expect the coming of the Messiah promised by their prophets, and observe the sevenu 
day of the week or the Sabbath. Since their dispersion, they have ceased to offer the 
sacrifices prescribed by the law, and instead of their ancient priests or Levites, they have 
substituted Rabbins or learned men, ivho expound the law in the synagogues. Among the 
Jewish sects are the Talmudists, so called bscause ihey receive the Talmud, a collection 
of traditions and comments upon their sacred books ; the Caraites, who reject the absurd 
traditions and superstitious follies of the Talmud ; liie Rechabites, who live in tbe Oases near 
Mecca, and receive only the earlier books of the Old Testament ; and tbe Samaritans, who 



mly tl 
still offer sacrifices on Mount Gerlzim. 

4. Chrutianily- Although founded on Judaism, and originating among tbe Jews, Chris- 

tianity teaches, ibal the Messiah, promised hy 
the Jewish prophets, bas come, and brought 
a new revelation to men, and that Jesus Christ 
is this Messiah ; the New Testament contains 
the revelations of this divine Teacher. 

Among all the religions of ancient and 
modern times, there is none which wilt bear 
tbe lest of a rational investigation, except 
Christianity. Tliis is the only system which 
can pretend to a divine origin, and tbe only 
one to which mankind can look for a remedy 
against the various moral evils which are seen 
to pervade every branch of the great human 
family.

Roman Catholic, Latin, or Western church, maintains the supremacy of tbe Pope, prevails â€¢ 

in many parts of Europe, and bas a considerable number of followers in North America. 

In some of the West India islands, in Mexico, Guaiemalaj and South America, it is the 

esi^lished religion. 

The Protestants are those who protest against the Pope, and take tbe Bible of the Old and 
New Testament as their guide. They are divided into many sects, of which the principal 
ire Lutherans, Methodists, Presbyterians, Episcopalians, Congregationalisis, Baptists, Qua- 
kers. Unitarians, and Unlversalists. The Protestant religion, in its various forms, prevails 
in die United States, England, Scotland, Wales, Holland, and some other European coun- 
tries. 

5. Mahometanism. Islamism or Mahometanism was founded by Mahomet or Mohammed. 
n Arabian, wbo, admitting tbe divine mission of Moses and Jesus Christ, and acknowledging 
ihe sacred character of the Old tod New Testaments, claimed to be charged with new 
feveJations from God. Islamism teaches the immortality of the soul, a future judgment, &.c. ; 
n prescribes prayer five times a day ; frequent ablutions ; fasting during tbe month Kamazan ; 
yearly alms, to the amount of the fortieth of one's personal property ; pilgrimage to Mecca, 
lad some other rites ; the temples are called mosques, and divine service is performed in tbem 
erery Friday. 

The sacred book of the Mahometans is the Koran, an Arabic word signifying the Book ; 
it b written in Arabic. The principal Mahometan sects are the Sonnites, who acknowl 
edge the authority of certain traditions and commentaries on the Koran ; the Shiites, in- 
eluding the Nosairians, Ismaelians, Druses, &c., who reject these traditions ; the Yezids, 
whose religious system consists of a mixture of Christianity and Mahometanism ; and the 
Wihabites, an Arab sect, which arose during the last century, and has endeavored to effect 
1 reformation of Islamism by purging it of human comiptioos and restoring its primitive sim-

9Z INTRODUCTION. 



n recognises ihe existence of a supreme intelligence, Brdhm, 
but teaches, that he governs the world through 
the medium of numerous subordinate deiiiet. 
The principal of these are Brahma, the Crea- 
tor, who presides over the land ; V'^ishnu, the 
Preserver, presiding over water ; and Sivi, 
the Destroyer, who presides over fire ; ihese 
three persons are, however, but one God, and 
form the Trimourii or Hindoo Trinity. Tbe 
Hindoos, who profess this faith, heve several 
sacred books, called Vedas, "written- in San- 
scrit, and forming their code of religion aod 
philosophy ; they teach the metempsychosis 
or transmigration of souls, and the immortality 
of the soul, and prescribe a great number of 
fasts, penances, and rites. Pilgrimages, vol- 
untary death, self-torment, ablutions, &c. ate 
practised, and the females of tlie two hi^iei 
Brahma Â«n4 FitknM. Castes are required to burn themselves on the 

dead bodies of their husbands. 

7. Bnddhism. Buddhism resembles Brahmanism in many points ; it is the prevailing religion 
in Thibet, Ceylon, the Birman empire, and Annam ; and is professed by a portion of the peo- 
ple of China, Corea, and Japan. Buddhism teaches, that the universe is inhabited fay several 
classes of existences, partly material and partly spiritual, which rise by successive transmign- 
tioDS to a higher degree of being, until, at last, they attam the supreme felicity of onnihilatioi). 
The highest beings are called Buddhas. ' Tbey appear from time to time upon earth in a human 
fbiTD, to preserve the true doctiine among men ; four Buddhaa have appeared, the last uodac 
the name of Shigemooni, Godama, or Fo. 

8. JVbn<fcÂ«m. Nanekism, or the religion of the Seiks, founded by Nanek in the fifteenth 
century, is a mixture of Mohammedanism and Brahmanism. The Seiks adore one God, be- 
lieve in future rewards and punishments, and reject the use of images as objects of worship ; 
they receive the Vedas and the Koran, as sacred books, but think that the Hindoos have cor- 
rupted their religious system by the use of idols. 

9. Doctrines of Confucius. The Doctrine of the Learned, or the Religion of Confucius, 
is the received religion of the educated classes of China, Annam, and Japan ; it uses no ima- 
ges, and has no priests, the ceremonies being performed by the civil magistrates. The riles, 
such as the worship of the heavens, stars, mountains, and rivers, genii, and souls of the depert- 
edj are esteemed merely civil institutions. 

10. Magianism. Magianlsm or the Religion of Zoroaster, teaches the existence of a su- 
preme being, Zervan or the Eternal, subordinate to whom are Ormuzd, (he principle of good, 
and Ahriman, the principle of evil, who wage a perpetual warfare ; numerous inferior deities 
and genii take part in the struggle, in which Ormuzd will finally prevail. The sacred books of 
the Magians are called the Zendavesta. The ceremonies consist chiefly in purifications, ablu- 
tions, and other rites, performed in the presence of the sacred fire, the symbol of the primeval 
life ; hence the Magians are erroneously called fire-worshippera.

GENERAL YSBW 



THE GLOBE. 



1. Northern and Southtm Hemisphere. The temqueous globe is divided by tbe eqwUr 
into two equal parts, called the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. But the slightest rlance 
at a map of the world will show, that there Is a much greater accumulaticHi of dry land id the 
former than in tbe latter ; recent voy^es have, indeed, sbowu, that this iDeqiality is not so great 
as was thought by geographers of the last century, lai^e masses of land having been discovÂ«ed 
io tbe Antarctic Seas, and the Northern coasts of Asia and America having been shown not to 
extend so far north as was once supposed. Tbe following statement will ^ow the comparative 
distribution of land and water in the two hemispheres. If we divide the whole surface of die 
eirtli into 1000 parts, we shall find 

Und. Wtter. 

In the whole sphere, 266 parts. 734 parts. 

Southern Hemisphere, 66-7 " 431-3 " 

Northern Hemisphere, 197-3 " 302-8 " 

Tbe whole of Asia, Europe, and North America, much the greater part of Africa, and a 
part of South America, lie north of tbe equator, and large masses of land advance to within 
26 degrees of tbe north pole, and considerable tracts much nearer. While only a small poraon 
of Auica, with New Holland, the bulk of South America, and some islands, rise above tbe 

waters in the south. 
There is, indeed, a much 
larger tract about tbe 
south than around the 
north pole, that has not 
been explored, and it is 
now ascertained that an 
Antarctic continent lies 
in that quarter. Amer- 
ica reaches only to 56Â° 
South Lat., Africa to 
34Â°, and New Holland 
to 45Â°, while on the 
north, Asia, Europe, 
and America, project 
above tbe 70tb parallel 
of latitude. 

ft. Eastern and WeA- 
em HemUpkere. The 
two great continents of 
whh:h the land is com- 
posed, are commonly so 
projected on maps as to 
form two separate hemi- 
Epheres. The eastern

tion to the continental 
portion, New Holland

pnses most of the small islands of the Pacific with the American continent. The distribution 
of land and water is not less unequal in this than in the former division. Thus we have

In the Eastern Hemisphere, 320 parts. 186 parts. 

Li the Western Hemisphere, 414 ^^ 80 



C4 



Jfarthem Coast, 



Another strikmg circumstance in the conformation of the two continents, is the different 
disposition of the land in each. In the old continent, the principal extension is to the west and 
east, the breadth from north to south being comparatively inconsiderable, particularly if we leave 
out the southern tongue of Africa ; in the new, the great extension is from north to south. 
In the former, we may draw continuous straight lines over land of great extent, but in 
the latter, in order to draw lines of much length, it will be necessary to make them winding. 
Thus a straight line from the Gulf of Guinea to the northwestern coast of Siberia is 9,000 
miles in length ; the longest straight line we can draw on the new continent is from Cumana to 
Terra del Fuego, 5,400 miles. Conformable to this general extension of the land, is the 

direction of the great 
mountain chains in the 
two hemispheres. The 
Rocky Mountains, the 
Cordilleras, and the An- 
des, stretch north and 
south ; while starting 
with the Pyrenees and 
the Alps in Europe, we 
may follow an almost un- 
broken chain of lofty 
mountains, comprising the 
Tauro-Caucasian, Hima- 
laya, and other Asiatic 
chains, to the shores of 
the Pacific ocean. Even 
the direction of the small- 
er portions of both con- 
tinents, as their islands 
and peninsulas, nearly 
coincides with the general 
course of the great moun- 
tain chains. 

We shall now proceed 
to describe the different 
countries and states of 
die globe under the fol- 
lowing heads and m the 
Westeml^hcre. foUowmg order ; 

1. Earope. â€” 2. Asia. â€” 3. Africa. â€” 4. Greenland. â€” 5. North America. â€” 6. West 
liiÂ£es. â€” 7. South America. â€” 8. Cteeanica. 

Cvtving first a general description of each division, sketching its pifysical and political features, 
and pouting out its mineAls, plants, animals, and inhabitants, we shall then pass to a more par- 
tioalar ooogideration of the separate parts ot which it consists.

its greatest length from east to west is 3,300 iniles ; its greatest breadth 2,500 miles ; area 
3,720,000 square miles. 



3. Stas and Gitlfi. On the nortfaem coast is the White Sea, a large and deep bay, but 
frozen over a considerable part of the year. Between Great Britain and the continent is ibe 
German Ocean or ^ortk Sea, an arm of which, between Jutland and Norway, is caUed tbe 
Sci^erac ; and another, between Jutland and Sweden, takes the name of tbe Cattegal. The 
German Ocean covers an extent of 200,000 square mites, and is divided into two parts bj 
the Do^er Bank. The navigation of this aea '3 dangerous, being exposed to violeiit and 



EUROPE 69 

TDrJable winils. Its encroachments upon its 
southern coast have formed the Gulf of Dol- 
lar! and the Zuyder See. The Baltic Seq 
extends between Sweden and Russia, and 
Germany. It is 600 miles long, and has an 
area of 120,000 square miles. In many 
places it is shallow, and it is exposed to sud- 
den changes of the wind and violent storms ; 
its tides are inconsiderable, and it discharges 
its waters through the Sound and the two 
Belts into the ocean. The gulfs of Bothnia 
and Finland are its principal arms. The 
Bay of BUcay is an open bay on the western 
coast. 

The GvlJ of Bothnia extends northerly, 
CrMtUfiAtgiJfo/BiithUamaeict. between Sweden and Fiqland, 

350 miles, with a breadth of 50 
to 140. It is frozen so hard 
during winter, that travelers croas 
it from Sweden to Finland in 
reindeer sledges. 

The Medittrranean Sea is a 
large inland body of water, about 
2,000 miles in length, and vary 
log from 200 to 800 in breadth, 
covering an area of 1,000,000 
square miles. Tbi) tides in this 
sea are slight, nowhere exceeding 
iwo feet. A strong current 
through the Dardanelles, brings 
the waters of the Black Sea into 
this basin, and while a central 
current sets into it through the 
Straits of Gibraltar from the At- 
lantic Ocean, two lateral currents 
pour its waters through that chan- 
nel into the ocean. The Adri- 
alic Sea or the Gulf of Venice, 
and the Archipelago, are its piin- 
cipal arms. The Black Sea is a 
sort of large lake between Eu- 
rope and Asia, which discharges 
its waters by the Bosphorus, 
through the sea of Marmora and 
the Dardanelles, into the Medi- 
terranean. Including the Sea of 
Jltoph, which is properly a gulf 
of the Black Sea, the latter cov- 
ers an area of 200,000 square 
miles. It is so tempestuous and 
boisterous as to be difficult of 
navigation.

^^S'^^k^'SLX^^'iSSTi.'-'^^-'""^'^-^- peninsula; their greatest elevt- 



bong are from 10,000 to 11,400 feet. The ^Ipa are the principal trunk of the second peU 
European system of mountains, whose branches stretch into France, Germany, Italy, Hun- 
gary, Turkey, and Greece. The Votga, the Jura, and the Cnenna, in France, are in 
western spurs. The Alps, which extend betmen France and Italy, and the 
lerland, send off a long southern chain through Italy, un^er the name of the 
stretching easterly through the country to the south of the Danube, reach 
under the name of the Balkan, and the Mores under the name of the Pindm 
summits are in Switzerland and Savoy, and attain an elevation of from 14 
feet. A third mouDtainous system is the Carpathian, which nearly surround 
extends along the frontiers of Moldavia, sending off several low ranges into 
highest summit is not quite 10,000 feet high. The fourth system of mouotains i 
man, which traverses the peninsula of Scandinavia, and nowhere exceeds an ele 
feet. 

4. Capes. The most northerly extremity of ihe mainland is JVortA Eyn in Finroark ; Cape 
AbWA is the extreme point of Mageroe, an island of Norway. Cape Skagen or the Skaw, 
the northern extremity of Juclaod, gives names to the Scagerac. Cape lAndetnat, or the 
Naze, Is the southern point of Sweden. Cape fVrath on the northern coast of Scotland, Cape 
Clear in Ireland, and Land'i End in England, are the most noted capes of the British Isles. 
Cape La Hogut on the northwest coast of France, Cape FinuUrrt in Spain, capes Roca and 
St. Pincent in Portugal, project into the Atlantic Ocean. (?ape SparlivttUo in Italy, and 
Cape Matapan in Greece, are the principal points in the Meditercanean. 

5. Peninmlaa. Europe is much indented by arms of the sea, which form numerous peoiii- 
sulas. The" Scandinavian peninsula, comprising Norway, Sweden, aud Lapland, is the larg- 
est ; the isthmus, between the Gulf of Bothnia and the White Sea, is less than 300 miles 
across. The peninsula of Jutland is much smaller. Id the south, Spain and Portugal form a 
large peninsula, with an isthmus of about 220 miles across. Italy, the Morea, joined to tbe 
continent by he-narrow isthmus of Corinth, and the Crimea, projecting into the Black Sea, are 
the other most remarkable projections of this nature, 

6. hlandi. The principal islands are the groups of Nova Zembla and Spitzbergen, in tbe 

Arctic Ocean; the British Archi- 
pelago, compitsing Great Brit- 
ain, Ireland, and the adjoioitw 
isles, on the western coast ; and 
Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily, nod 
Candia, in the Mediterranean. 
Most of these will be elsewhere 
described. 

Candta belongs pr^litically to 
Africa, as it now forms a part of 
the Egyptian state. It is 160 
miles long, and from 15 to 50 
broad, with an area of 4,000 
square miles, and 275,000 in- 
habitants. KnjoyiDg a fine cli- 
mate, excellent harbors, and a 
favorable position, Candia has 
been deprived of the benefit of 
Its natural advantages, by Turkish tyranny, Tlie chief town is Candia, with 15,000 inhabit- 
ants, much declined from its former prosperity and splendor. Canea is at present the most 
commercial place in the island ; it has 12,000 inhabitants. Sphakia is remarkable as the 
chief place of a district, inhabited by a warlike people, called SphakioU, who have preserved 
their independence. 

The .tSxoret, in the Atlantic, midway between Europe and America, are, by some geogra- 
phers, considered as belonging to Europe, to which they are poliiicatly attached, being a Por- 
tuguese colony. The group consists of nine small islands, with about 200,000 inhabiunts. 
The principal are St. MiekaeVt, Terceirot Pieo, and Fayal. Jingra, on Terceira, is tbe 
oapitaj, and has a population of 16,000. PorUa DeJgada, on S. MichMl't, has about 18,000 ia- 
habitanti 



7. Biotrt. The principal rive' of Europe is the Volga, ibe oafy stream whose coune ex- 

ceeds 2,000 miles in length. 
The Danube was long consid- 
ered the largest European river, 
but it has a course of less thau 
1 ,900 miles. The Danube rise* 
in the Black Forest in Baden, 
becomes navigable at Ulra in 
Bavaria, passes through the 
Austrian empire, and separates 
Austria, Wallachia, and Rus* 
sia, from the Ottoman empire ; 
after receiving 30 nav^able 
streams, tt enters the Black 
Sea by five principal moulbs. 
The Dnieper, the Don, the 
Rhine, the Elbe, the Vistula, 
the Oder, the Loire, Niemen, 
StntrctofariTer. Dniester, and Rhone are the 

next most considerable rivers of Europe. 

8. Face of the Country. The central part of this continent is, in general, mountainous 
The Miole northern part, extending from London and Paris to Kazan, and comprising the 
northern part of France and Germany, the Dutch and Belgian Netherlands, Prussia, Poland, 
and a great part of Russia, is a vast plain, little elevated above the level of the sea, and scarcely 
broken by any considerable elevations. There are several elevated plains or plateausin Eu- 
rope, but of no great extent. The Swiss plateau, lying between the Jura and tne Alps, has an 
elevation of from 1 ,B00 to 4,000 feet. Central Spain forms an elevated lable-land, 2,200 feet 
high, and the central part of Russia forms a similar plateau, about 1,200 feet high. 

9. Climate. In general, the climate of southern Europe may be described as mild, and that 
of the north severe, with long and cold winters, and hot hut short summers. The climate 
of the western coast is, however, tempered by the vicinity of the ocean, and the same cause 
renders it liable to sudden and violent changes. That of the eastern part of the continent is 
rendered much colder, in corresponding latitudes, by its exposure to the icy winds of northern 
and central Asia. The heat, brought by the burning winds of the African deserts to the 
southern countries, is, in general, tempered by tlieir great exposure to the sea, occasioned by 
theT peninsular formation. The mountains of Switzerland, Spain, and Hungary, also modify 
the character of the climate in the extensive districts, which they cover. 

10. JHineralt. Europe is less rich, in the precious minerals, than the other quarters of the 
Â§lobe, but it produces great quantities of coal, iron, lead, tin, copper, and salt. Gold, silver, 
platina (in the Ural Mountains), and mercury or quicksilver, which is of great importance in 
working gold and silver mines, and diamonds (Ural mountains), and some other precious 
stones, are also found in considerable quantities. 

1 1 . Vegetable Productiom. The most south- 
ern parts of Europe have a vegetation resem- 
bling that of Africa, and here we Gnd the date- 
tree (Phainix dactytifera) fdvar{-pBi]m {Chama- 
ropi hvtnilis), end banana {Muia pamditiaea), 
giving a tropical aspect to the country. In 
these latitudes the fig, the olive, the orange, 
the vine, and the maize, find a congenial cli- 
mate, and even the sugar-cane is cultivated in 
Sicily, The olive will not thrive, even in val- 
leys, higher than 44Â° SO', nor will the vine yield 
good wine north of 43Â°, except in a few shel- 
Olht Tree. tered spots. At about the northern limits of 

Ibe olive, that is, in the parallel of the south of France, the southern forms of vegetation dis* 
ippear : the Qttemo cerrit, so common in Italy and Turkey, is hardly seen, and eveip-een oaks 
(Q. flu), and common oaks (Q. PeduneuIataandfeMt/Iora), supply its place. Clusters of pinea

leaved ash (Fraxinus oxyphylla), the 
flowering ash (OmiuEwrop(E(i),masiieb- 
trees, &c., do not thrive further north, 
in a wild slate. Still more to the north, 
where the vine begins lo languish, iu 
place is occupied by fields of wheat and 



EuTirptan Oak. RyÂ» ^nd Oats. 

Other corn ; the hardier trees, elms, lime (Tilia Europcea), oaks, ashes, alders (tambuemj^ 
beeches (fagtts), birches (belnla), willows {salix), and poplars (^poputus), are found every- 
where. At last, in ihe more northern districts, aspens {Populus Irtmuld), bird-cherries (PrÂ«- 
nws Padus), birches, lime-trees, alders, junipers, spruce-firs (^biea excelsa), and pines, are the 
principal trees that remain ; barley and oats are the only corn-plants, but potatoes coDtinue to 
be reared in the short cold summers. To the north of the limit of the olive, turnips and buck-

wheat {Polygonum fagopyrvm) are cultivated advantageously, as are also hemp, flax* hops, 
carrots, parsnips, common clover, beans, vetches, and lucerne, as common field-crops. la still 
higher latitudes, the predominani forms of herbaceous vegetauoa are numerous species of raoun-

cuius, saxifrages, primiila, rooss, 
lichens ; and there also occur abun- 
dance of stunted or pigmy irailiog 
shrubs,such as bilberries ( Facet nt'iim 
myrtillus), and whortleberries (F. 
uHginosum), dwarf willows (Salu 
herbacea), crowberries {Empetrvm 
nQrum) , bear's foot ( Uva wn) , and 
the like. These changes occur with 
the change of latitude in the low 
country, but similar alterations take 
place, if we ascend from the plains 
to the mountains. In Sicily, for in- 
slance, from the tropical vegetation 
of the valleys, you may ascend 
through' that of the temperate and 
frigid zones, by climbing the lofty 
flanks of Etna. 

12. Mimalt* The Wild Bull 
or aurocks {Bos una) is chiefly 
to be met with in the extensive 
forests of Lithuania. It is black, 
and of great size ; the eyes are 
red and fiery ; the horns thick 
and short, and the forehead cover- 
ed with a quantity of curled hair. 
This animal greasy resembles the 
tame kind. The Musmon {Ovii 
mvamon) is considered as a link 
between the sheep and goat, resem- 
bling both of them. It is found in 
Greece, Sardinia, Corsica, and 
Tarlary. It is strong and muscu- 
lar, and runs with great agility over 
the most dangerous precipices. It 
is very timid, and seldom taken 
alive. The Goal is very abundsDt

of the necessaries of life. The Ibex {Capra ibex) iohabita the highest Alps, aod is fooDJ 
also in Candia ; it is very wild, and the chase of it is attended with great danger. Tbe 
Chamois (^ntUope rvpicapra) is very abundant in the mountainous parts of Europe, wiwre 
it is found in flocks among the rocks. The hunting of this animal is very laborious and difi. 
cult, but followed with great ardor by the hunters, who frequently lose their lives in the pursmt. 
The Elk {Ctrvw aket) is the lai^est and most formidable of the deer kind of Europe. It 
inhabits the nortbern parts. It is 7 or 8 feet high, and its horns are of a lai^e an- 
It is timid and iaofiensire, and runs with great swiftness, in a high shambling kind of trot. Tbe 
Reindeer (C. tarandtu) inhabits the northern regions of Europe, and is of the greatest im- 
portance to the inhabitants, particularly to tbe Laplanders, who derive from it all the necessi- 
ries of life. 

The Stag or Red Deer (C. eUtphw) is found in the forests and mountains of the nonh 
of Europe ; but it is not as numerous in its wild state as formerly in England ; yet many of tbem 
â– re kept in parks. The bunting of the stag has always been a favorite diversioa. 



The stag or Rat Dar. Thn FttOoa Deer. 

The Fallow Deer (0. dama) difiers from the stag in the size and form of its horns, but in 
other respects these two animals are nearly tbe same. The Fallow Deer is found in nearly 
all the couniries of Europe, with a slight variation of color. The Roe Buck (C eopreoiw) 
was formerly common in England and Wales, but it is now only found in the Highlands of 
Scotland, and other northern parts of Europe. It is the smallest of the European deer, ele- 
gant in its form, and light and easy in its movements. It runs with great swiftness, aod shows 
great artifice in eluding its pursuers. 

The Wild Boar {Sib aptr) is the original stock of the varieties of the hog. He is nearlf 
black, and armed with formidable tusks in each jaw. He will not attack an animal if uapnh 
voked- The hunting of the wild boar is a dangerous but common amusement, in the countries 
where he is found.

EUROPE. K 

The lijnx (fVN* /ynx) is very common in (be 
north of Europe, and its fur is valuable for its soft- 
ness and narmth. It ia a loog-ltved, destructive 
animal, lives by hunilng, and pursues its prey tc 
the tops of the highest trees. Its sight is remark- 
ably acute, and it sees its prey at a great distancs. 
The Wild-cat (F. catat) exists with little variety 
in every climate of Europe, where it frequents 
the mouniainous and woody regions, living in 
trees, and hunting small birds and animals. It is 
very fierce, and defends itself with great spirit 
from any attack. It is larger and stronger than 
the tame cat, of which it is the original stock, 
and its fur is much longer. The Weasel (Mvm- 
mid Boar. '''^ vulgaris) is very common. The Stoat 

(jjf. erminen) is often met with in the nortth 
â€¢ra parts ef Europe, and is of a yellowish brown color in summer, and nearly while in winlei, 
ffbeo i( is called irmitu. It is then much sought after for its valuable fur, which makes â€¢ 
considerable article of commerce. It resembles the weasel in its habits and manners. The 
Viae Weasel [J^. abielvm) is found in the north of Europe, living in large forests, and feeding 
OD the tops end seeds of pine trees. The skins of these animals form an article of commerce. 
The Manen (JW. fagorMm) is very common, and lives wholly in the woods and feeds on 
jBuU animals and birds. The Sable {M. nbellina) is highly esteemed for its fur, and is Â« 
Miive of the cold regions of the north. It lives in holes in the earth by the banks of riven, 
ind is very lively and active in pursuit of its prey. Immense numbers of them are taken in 
Russia. The Polecat {M. pu(mus) resembles the marten in appearance, but differs from k 
in having a most ofiensive smell. The Genet ( Genttta vulgarii) is met with in Turkey, and 
BpaJn, where it is found lo be useful in destroying rats, 
mice, and other vermin. It yields an agreeable perfumÂ«. 
The Badger (J\ieltÂ» w^lgaris) is a native of the lemperata 
climates of Europe, but does not exist in warm countries. 
It is an indolent animal and sleeps much, and feeds only in 
the night. It lives in holes in the ground, and subsists on 
roots, fruits, grass, and insects. lis skin and hair are used 
GauL for various purposes. The Glutton or Wolverene {Gvl* 

hacta) is found in the northern countries of Europe. It is famous for its gluttony and strength 
li attacks large animals by fastening itself on their necks ; it then sucks their blood and de* 
Toors ibe Sesh. It is hunted for its skin, which is very valuable. 
The BiowD Bear {Vrnu ^ctoi) is found in almost every climate, and is a savage and solitar; 

animal, living in inaccessible preci- 
pices, and unfrequented places. This 
animal will often climb trees and de- 
vour fruit in great quanlilies. It climbs 
with surprising agility, keeps itself 
firm on the branches with one paw, 
and, with the other, collects the fruit. 
It is remarkably fond of honey, which il 
nil) encounter great difficulties to ob 
tain. Itsvoice IS a deepand surly growl, 
and it is easily irritated. It is ofien 
tamed end taught to perform various 
tricks. The Brown Bear is very 
widely diffused, being found in moun- 
tainous distriC" from the "Pyrenees 
and Alps to tht. Arctic circle, and n 
far east as Kamtchatka. The Lap-

They never presume 
to call it by its own 
name, lest it should 
be oSended, but roen- 
tion it as " the old 
man with tbe Itii 
cloak." It is a curi- 
ous fact, that the 
North American Indi- 
ans seem to hold die 
bear in the same re- 
spect, as has already 
been stated, under tbe 
head of North Amer 
ica. The bear, which 
. figures so often in ifae 
Jitecft fiÂ»â„¢pÂ«m B^. accounts of the old 

Enghsh sports, as af- 
fording the cruel pastime of besr-bating, and as being taught to dance for the amusement of 
tbe people, was the brown bear. Some authors have thought, that there was another species 
found in Europe, to which they gave the name of the Black Bear {Ursits niger), but ttus 
is now considered to have been a mistake. 

The White or Polar Bear ( U. maritimvi) is much larger than the Brown Bear, and is of 
a yellowish white color. It inhabits only the coldest parts of the globe, and sometimes lives 
on large islands of ice. It feeds on the carcasses of whales, fish, and seals. It is very 
ferocious, and is remarkable for its attachment to its young. 

The Fox {Vulpea vulgarii) is spread over Europe, and everywhere displays the same 

activity and cunning. The chase of tbe fox is a very favorite diversion in Great BriiaiB, 

where it is pursued with great ardor. The Greyhound Fox is found in the mounraioous 

parts of England and Scotland. He is very bold and wild in his appearance. The Cur 

Fox is the most common and tbe smallest 

species. It lurks about the houses, and 

steals every thing within its reach. It is 

I very pl^ful and familiar when tamed. Tbe 

I Black Fox ( V. argenlaltu) is found in Bus- 
sia, and its skin is esteemed superior to the 
finest sable. The Cross Fox {V. deetma- 
tut) is found In thecoldest parts of Europe, 
where its fur is very valuable. The Arctic 
- Fox ( V. lagojnu) is found in the frozen re- 
I gtons of the north, and is of a whitish color- 
It burrows in the ground, and sometinei 
(lives in clefts of rocks. 
The Wolf (C. lupw) is found in al- 
most every couHliy in the world, and rs 
very common in ifurope. Its appetite for 
nt Cammen Fax. every kiod of animal food is excessive, and 

when hungry it will attack all sorts of ani- 
mats ; even man himself has sometimes fallen a victim to its rapacity. The Jackal (C. aurtvi) 
â– 9 found in Greece. It goes in packs, and hunts like a hound in full cry. It destroys poultry 
and flocks, and carries oS all it can find. It also seeks for dead bodies, and devours them 
ft bid<^ in boles during the day, but bunts its prey in the lught.

Dogi. Of t&eie Inere m 
a great variety in Europe, thÂ» 
principal of nhich are the Shep

Coach Dog, Irish Greyhound, 
Grey-hound Terrier, Beagle, 
Harrier, Fox-hound, Old Eng- 
lish Hound, Blood-hound, Eng- 
lish Setter, Water Spaniel,

Dog. 

The Hare (^Ltpvt timidm) 
is a harmless and iooffensive 
Wolets auaeking Caitle. animal, fearful of every danger, 

but provided with means of eluding its pur- 
suers by iis great swiftness. It is much hunt- 
ed by man, and by beasts of prey, and is . 
seldom permitted lo enjoy a long life. It 
is found in all parts of Europe. The Al- 

fiine Hare (L. variabiUe) changes in winter 
rom gray to white. It lives m the moun- 
tains of the north of Europe. It is easily 
tamed, and is very playful and frolicksome. 
The Rabbit (L. cunictifu*] though it resem- 
bles the bare in appearance, difiers from it 
in its habits and propensiiies. It is common 
, in various parts of Europe, and abounds in 

Great Britain, where its skin is used in the 
'manufacture of hats. 
i:TÂ«,â„¢.fl-Â«. &itarrtli. The Gray Squrrel (SHvm 

Vulgarii) 19 common in the northern countriet 
of Europe, and changes its color in the winter. Its tail is long and bushy. It makes its 
nesbin hollow trees, and lays up stores of provisions for winter use. lis fur is very valuable. 
The Fat Squirrel is found in France and the southern parts of Europe. It is of an ash color, 
and its fur is very soft. The Greater Dormouse is common in the south of Europe, where it 
infests gardens, and lodges in holes in walls. It is very destructive to all kinds of fruit 
The Lesser Dormouse lives in woody or thick hedges, and makes its nest with grass or dried 
leaves. The Flying Squirrel {S, volaiu) is found in the northern regions of Europe ; it 
sleeps in the day, but is extremely active at night. It frequently takes leaps of twenty or 
durty yards, and where numbers of them are seen at a tJme leaping, they appear like leaves 
blown by the wind. 

JUarmolt. The Itlarmot {.Srclomyt marmoUa) inhabits the highest regions of the Alps, and 
IS likewise found in Poland. It lives in holes formed in the side of a mountain. There are 
two entrances to each, and the chambers to which they lead are deep and spacious. In winter 
they shut themselves up by stopping up the entrance to their holes, roll themselves up in hay, 
and lie torpid till the warm season. The Lapland Marmot or Leming (Georychua) are found 
in the northern parts of Europe, in immense numbers, overspreading large tracts of couniiy io 
their march from one place to another. Neither fire nor water prevents their progress ; they 
go straight forwards, swim across lakes and rivers, and overcome every obstacle, or die in the 
attanpt. Their march is mostly in the night. They rest during the day, and devour all the 
heriwge that they meet with. Foxes, lynxes, and weasels destroy great numbers of them. 
The Hamster (Crieelta tulgarii) is found in various parts of Germany and Poland. It is 
oTibe size of a large water rat. It lives in the ground, where it lays up a great store of pro-

Turboi, and others, particularly valued for the 

iFidgeim. table, which are not found m America, or very 

rarely. 

14. PopalaHon. It is diffictdt to estimate the precise amount of the population of Europe, 

MwithstandiDg the accuracy with which the census of some countries has been taken . for wÂ« 



â€¢yg EUEC^E 

do not possess a census of contemporary surveys, and in Turkey the population can only bÂ« 
loosely estimated from the number of hearths paying tax to the Porte. The population-returns 
of Hungary, Spain, and Transylvania, are very old. In 1787, Zimmerman estimated the pop- 
ulation of Europe at 144,000,000; Malte Brun, at 205,000,000; Balbi, in 1826, stated it at 
227,000,000, and the best recent estimates make it, at present, about 238,000,000 This pop- 
ulation is not equally concentrated throughout Europe. Thus, in the Duchy of Lucca, it is in 
the ratio of 2S8 to a square mile ; while in Iceland and Faroe it is only If ; in the Nether* 
lands it is as 212, in Great Britain as 178, and in Sweden and Norway as 10 to the square mile. 
Upon the whole, the south of Europe is more populous than the north, in proportion to its ex- 
tent : and must continue so, as the means of subsistence are procured with so much greater 
facility in the countries of the former, than in those of the latter. The climate of Norway is 
quite as favorable to longevity as that of Lucca ; but the oneÂ«comprehends a vast tract of rug- 
ged, unti liable surface ; the other is a garden throughout. 

15. Inhabitants. The inhabitants of Europe belong to 20 different* races, but 5 of these 
comprise the great bulk of the population. I. The German or Teutonic race comprises the 
Germans, Dutch, Danes, Swedes, Norwegians, English, and a part of the Swiss ; these people 
speak Teutonic dialects. 2. The Greco-Latin race comprises the Greeks, Albanians, Wala- 
chians, Italians, French, Spaniards, and Portuguese, with a part of the Swiss. 3. The Scla- 
vonic race embraces the Russians, Poles, Lithuanians, Bohemians, Servians, Bosnians, Dal- 
matians, Bulgarians, with the Wends of Prussia, the Sorbians of Prussia and Saxony, the Lettes 
of Russia, &c. These three races are the most numerous. 4. To the Uralian or Finnic race 
belong the Finns, Laplanders, Esthonians, in the extreme north, and some smaller tribes io 
Russia. 6. The Turkish race comprises the Ottoman Turks or ruling people of Turkey, the 
Turcomans, the Magyars or Hungarians, and the tribes called Tartars, in Russia. 

Beside these principal races, are the Biscayans of Spain ; the Celts, comprising the High- 
landers of Scotland, the native Irish, the Welsh, and the Bretons of western France; the 
Samoiedes ; the Mongols, of whom the only tribe are the Calmucks of Russia ; Jews ; Armenians ; 
Gypsies, &c. The Gypsies, called Bohemians in France, Gitanos in Spain, and Zigeuner in 
Germany, are a roving tribe, supposed to be originally from Hindostan ; they are scattered all 
ovev Europe, and their number is estimated at 600,000 or 800,000. They live sometimes in 
tents, often in caves, or in huts half tmder ground, and covered with sods. They rarely pursue 
any regular trade, but are often jugglers, fortune-tellers, &c. They have a peculiar language, 
but no religion, except a few superstitious observances. 

16. Religion. There are three great monotheistical systems of religious belief predominaot 
in Europe, viz : - 

(I .) Christianity, of which the principal seat and centre, though not the birth-place, is Europe 
The Christian nations in Europe, are divided into three leading sects, viz. 1st. The Greek 
Catholic, or Eastern Church, which prevails in Greece, part of Albania and Bulgaria, in Servia, 
Sclavonia, Croatia, Walachia, Moldavia, Russia, &c. 2d. The Latin or Roman Catholic 
Church, of which the Pope, one of the sovereign powers of Europe, is the head. This creed 
is predominant in Italy, Spain, Portugal, France, Austria, the halt of Germany and of Switzer- 
land, Belgium, Poland*, and Ireland, and numbers some adherents in Great Britain, Holland, 
and Turkey. 3d. The Protestant Church, which predominates, under different creeds, in 
Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Great Britain, Prussia, a part of Germany and of Switzerland. 
This faith has also numerous professors in Hungary, Transylvania, and France. Its principal 
branches are the Lutheran, the Presbyterian or Reformed, and the Fpiscopalian Churches 
(2.) Mahometanism, or Islamism, is professed by the Turks. (3.) The Mosaic or Jewish 
religion. There are about 2,500,000 Jews scattered throughout Europe. They are not tol- 
erated in Spain, Portugal, and Norway. In the Austrian States they have few privileges. In 
Great Britain their situation is not quite satisfactory. In Russia the laws relating to them have 
recently become very intolerant. In the States of the German confederation, in France, Prus- 
sia, and the Low Countries, they enjoy the rights of citizens ; but in Poland, they have but re- 
cently lost their privileges. The Calmucks, and many of the Samoiedes, are Pagans.

EUBOPE. 77 

IT* Clames of Socithf. In almost every European state, we find tbe citizens divided Mio 
lour distioct classes. The first is that of the nobility, which exists in everr state, with the 
exception of Norway and the ^urkish empire. Nobility is, in most cases, viewed in Europe 
ts an hereditary rank ; but it can be acquired by the will of the sovereign, and even, in some 
instances, purdhased by money. The cler^ form the second class of the community. The 
third is that of the citizens, or inhabitants of towns, which, in most countries, enjoys peculiar 
rights and privileges. The fourth and lowest class includes the peasants, and forms the mass 
oi the population in every country. 

18. InduUry and Commerce. With the exception of the Nogaiens, Lapponians, and Sa- 
moiedes, in Russia, who yet lead the life of herdsmen or hunters, all the nations of Europe have 
been permanently located for many centuries. The cultivation of the soil has, therefore, been 
carfi^ to great perfection in this part of the earth. Husbandry is pursued with the greatest 
industry, in the British empire, the Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany, some parts of Italy, 
Denmark, and SwedeA. The agriculture of tbe east of England, and Scotland, the Nether- 
iMids, Germany, and the northern parts of France and Italy, is most distinguished ; although 
Russia, Hungary, and Poland, whose agriculture is not nearly so advanced, are the granaries 
of Europe. The rearing of cattle is, in some countries, pursued only in connexion with agri- 
culture ; in the mountainous districts alone, it forms the principal branch of rural industry.. The 
cultivation of fruits belongs to the temperate districts, particularly France and Germany ; but the 
finer fruits can only be extensively reared in the southern parts of Europe. The manufacture 
of wine is most considerable in France, the south of Germany, Hungary, Spain, Portugal, Italy, 
and the Turicish empire. The finest kinds are produced in Tokay, upon the Chalk Hills of 
Champagne, the Gold Hills of Burgundy, the banks of the Rhine and Garonne, in Spain, the 
two Sicilies, the banks of the Upper Douro, and some islands of the ^gean Sea. The olive 
belongs to the warmer regions, particularly Apulia, Atino, in the Neapolitan territory of Terra 
di Lavoro, and Spain ; the other vegetable oils are produced in the temperate parts of Europe. 
The rearing of silk-worms is also peculiar to warmer climates, and is chiefly carried on in Lom- 
bardy . The cultivation of forests has been greatly neglected in most countries, and in many, a 
Tery sensible want of wood begins to be felt, although Europe is, on the whole, well-stocked 
with wood.* Fishing i^ peculiarly important to the coast-nations of Europe, who take her- 
tunnies, anchovies, mackerels, and various other species of fish, from the surrounding 
Hunting forms a principal occupation only to a few small tribes in Russia. Mining is 
conducted with great skill in England, Germany, Hungary, and Sweden. 

European industry is rivalled by no other part of the world, either in the diversity or the 
extent of its productions, although the Japanese and Chinese have cultivated some branches of 
art for many thousand years. Europe not only manufactures its own raw produce, but also 
that of almost every other region of the earth. The principal seats of European industry are 
Great Britain, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Germany, and Switzerland. The best woolen 
fabrics are made in England and France ; cotton, in England, Saxony, and France ; linen, in 
Germany ; lace, in Brabant ; silks, in France ; paper, in Holland and Switzerland ; leather, 
ia Turkey and Russia ; china, in Germany ; earthen-ware, in England and France ; glass, in 
Bohemia and England ; hardwares, in England ; bijouteries, in France and England ; milli- 
neries, in France ; straw-hats, in Italy ; and jewelry-work, in France, Germany, and England. 
The internal commerce of Europe is carried on in all countries with considerable animation, 
and is facilitated by well-constructed highroads and canals, which are pai*ticularly good in the 
Brtti^ empire, the Netherlands, France, Lombardy, Prussia, and Russia. The British, 
French, Danes, Netherlanders, Swedes, Hanseates, Ragusans, and Hydriots, are most d's- 
tingnished in maritime commerce. But no nation can in this respect be compared with Great 
Britain, whose fleets are in every sea, and colonies in almost every region of the earth. As a 
medium of exchange, all European states coin money. Many states likewise support a paper

A Map of a Part of Europe^ Asia^ and ^rica, in AneieiU Times, 

20. Hiilory. The earliest historical notices, which we have of Europe, are derived from 
t!)e traditions of the Greeks, and relate tcTthe settlement of various colonies from Asia and 
Egypt on the southeastern coasts. These events appear to have taken place between 12 and 
15 hundred years before the Christian era ; and the fable of Europa, a Phoenician princess, 
from whom the name of this quarter of the world is said to have been derived, is no doubt 
founded on fact. The Cehs seem, at this time, to have occupied nearly the whole of Europe, 
ttd to have bee% gradually driven westward by the encroachments of the Teutonic and Scla- 
vonic races, until they have become nearly exrirpated. The Phoenicians, at an early period, 
explored the coasts of the Mediterranean, passed out of the Pillars of Hercules, along the 
Atlantic shores, to Britain, and probably even reached Denmark. The Greeks afterwards 
ibOowed in their course, and penetrated to the Baltic and the coasts of Norway. Under 
Akxander, that brilliant people conquered a great part of Asia in the fourth century before 
^ era, but the Romans were the first to found* a great European empire. From the Clyde 
to the Hellespont, all southern Europe obeyed their imperial decrees. 



But the spirit of liberty was kept alire ia the old Torests of Germany or Deutschland, snd 
after the divisioD of the Roman empire into the Western or Latin and the Eastern or Greek, 
the Teutonic hordes poured all over the Western countries, occupying Britain, France, Spain, 
and Italy. Thus commenced a ^ew era in the history of Europe, called the Middle Agtt 
The Greek empire of Constantinople was not completely overthroirn, by the Ottomans, untl

of the Roman empire, under Constantiae 
in the fith ceD[ury, and, in the courie 
of the next four centuries, the bisbopa of 
Rome, under the title of Popes, succeeded 
in causing themselves to be recognised as 
the supreme bead of the church in all west- 
em Europe. This spiritual empire re- 
ceived a fatal blow from Luther in the mid- 
dle of the 16th century, when the Protes- 
tants asserted the great principles of re- 
ligious liberty. The feudal system, whict

CEAPTEE U. THE UNITED KINGDOM OF GREAT BRITAIN AND 

IRELAND. 

1. Bmndaria. The United 
Ktoedom of Great Britain 
and Ireland is composed ot 
England, Wales, Scotland, 
and Ireland, with the isUnds 
lying upon their shores, and 
the Anglo-Norman Islands. 
The British Islands are 
bounded by the North Sea 
on the north ; the German 
Ocean washes the eastern 
shores. On the south, they 
are divided from France by 
the English Channel, which 
extends 350 miles from 
northeast to southwest. Be- 
tween Dover and Calais it 
is oarrowed to a strait 25 
miles in width, but this 
widens toward the Atlantic. 
At the entrance from the 
west, are the Eddysione 
rocks, 14 miles from the 
English coast. A lighthouse, 
upon these rocks, has long 
withstood the tremendous 
violence of the sea, which 
often, during a storm, buries 
the lantern in its waves. 
St. George's Channel and 
the Irish Sea constitute a 
navigable gidf of irr(>|riilfir 
dimensions between Great 
Riiriiin and Ireland, open

both to the north aod south. Tbf 
western shores of the British Iilodi 
are washed by the Atlantic. Ana, 
130,000 square miles. 

The island of Great Britain lies oi 
the western coast of Europe, and ex- 
tends from 50Â° to 58Â° SC N. latitude, 
and from 2Â° E. to 6Â° W. longitude. 
The island is 580 miles longfrom iiortfa 
to south, and 370 wide at the broid- 
est part, which js along the soulb- 
ern coast. It is very narrow ia some 
of the Dorthern parts. Its â€¢whole 
area is estimated at 88,600 squ&tt 
miles. Ireland is a little more thin 
one third of that area, and it de- 
scribed separately. 

The Anglo-Norman Islands lie upon the coast of France, and are a remnant of the British 
dominion *over ihe ancient Ducbj of Normandy- They are Jersey, Guernsey, Sark, tod 
Alderoey. The largest is about 12 miles in length. Guernsey and Jersey are cohered with 
orchards, and the latter has produced 24,000 hogsheads of cider io a year. The town of St- 
Helier, in this island, conains 7,000 inhabitants. The population of all the islands is about 
50,000. The inhabitants enjoy great political liberty, and their laws are based upon the 
ancient Norman customs, but an appeal lies from their courts to the king in council. Their 
language is French, and no act of parliament is binding upon them until sanctioned by their 
magistrates. They arcr exempt from naval and military service, and their commerce is un- 
chackied ; the free port of St. Helier allows them an open trade with the enemies of Great 
Britain, even during war. The Orkneys, Shetlands, and Hebrides, belong to Scotland, lod 
will be described under that head.

lure is carried on according to the most improved and scientific processes, whether originated 
in the country, or borrowed from abroad. The best breeds of cattle have been assiduously 
selected, whether of foreign or domestic origin, and cultivated with the greatest care, aud dw 
land has been industriously and skilfully treated according to the rules of the most intelligeat 
husbandry.

3. Mints and Manufactures, The unrivaled prosperity and extent of the manufactures of 
Great Britain are owing, in no small degree, to the abundant supply of coal, iron, limestone, 
salt, lead, copper, and tin, which different parts of the country afford. Coal, indeed, is the 
food, as iron is the muscle, of her vast manufacturing industry ; which has, perhaps, never been 
surpassed m the variety, amount, beauty, richness, and value of its products, in the ingenuity 
ud perfection of its processes, and in the skill, method, promptitude, and energy displayed 
in the management of its gigantic machinery.

The other principal items of manufacture are beer, spirits, soap, candles, refined sugar,

4. Commerce. History has nothing to show, either among the commercial people of an- 
tiqaity, or the Middle Ages, or in modern times, that can compare with the value and extent 
of the commercial operations of the British people. Carrying on, probably, the richest and 
most active home trade of any nation ; seeking, from foreign parts, the various materials 
of their innumerable manufactures ; distributing over all the world the surplus products of 
tbeir industry ; covering all seas with their merchantmen, and ruling all by their vast 'fleet, 
and admirably chosen military and mercantile posts, they have expanded their commercial 
8cti?it7 Â®^^Â° beyond the limits of their mighty political sway. The annual value of the 
imports is about 260 million dollars ; of exports 270 millions ; of this last sum, above 200 
miDioDs are of domestic produce and manufactures. The following table shows the coimtries 
to which the value of the exports is greatest. They are for the year 1838.

An attempt has been made by a distinguished statistical writer to estimate the whole ani- 
mate and inanimate power applied to agriculture, commerce, and manufactures in France 
and Great Britain ; converting the animal power, or that exercised by beasts of burden and 
'raft, and the inanimate power, or that derived from machinery, into their equivalent human 
power, or that exercised by effective laborers, he gives the following results :

Taking the whole force in each country and comparing it with the human force, we find the 
proportion in Great Britain to 1)e as 12 to 1, and in France less than 5 to 1 ; that is, the 
agriculturists of Great Britain have created and applied a force twelve times greater than their 
own corporeal force by the use they make of domestic animals, while the addition so made 
in France, does not amount to five times their own.

In France, the whole animate and inanimate force applied to commerce and manufactures, 
IS only about double that of the laborers themselves, while in Great Britain the whole force so 
employed is about four times that of the actual human force. The whole power so created 
m Great Britain, in all branches of industry, is equivalent to about 45,000,000 men-power ; 
m France to about 35,000,000 men-power. 

5. Government, These islands are under one government. The peculiarities of each 
livision are pointed oUt under their respective heads. The Parliament of England, or as it 
â€¢s now called, the Imperial Parliament, is the sole legislative body. The form of govem- 
Â«enl combines, according to theory, the three principles of monarchy, aristocracy, and de- 
Â«i8cracy. The powers of the king, as described in the chapter upon England, apply to the 
whole empire. The right of voting for members of parliament, depends on the laws for each 
particular part of the kingdom.* 



* Sinecures. These are officea without employment, 
but with salaries- They consist, in the first place, of em- 
ployments fallen into disuse, as the chief justices in Eyre, 
who enjoy salaries of Â£4,566; the Vice- Admiral of Got- 
land ; the keeper of the Privy Seals of Scotland ; and 
Chancellor ana Justice-General of Scotland ; the keeper 
of the Signet in Ireland ; all which have salaries of 1,500 
to 5,000 pounds. The master of the hawks in the royal 
household has Â£1,500. In the second place are the offi- 
ces, with salaries vasUy disprbportioneo to the "employ- 
ments, and in which the duties are wholly discharged by 
deputies. Some of these exceed Â£10,000. Some are 
nominal duties of a menial nature. A right honorable 
lady, a Baroness, has held the office of sweeper of the 
Mall in the Park. Noble lords hold the offices of wine- 
tasters, store-keepers, packers, craners, &o. The sine- 
cures amount in the whole to Â£356,555. 

Pmukms, &o There are about 1,500 pensioners, who 



receive Â£777,556 per annum. This iB exclusive of colo- 
nial pensions, grants, allowances, half pay, and superan- 
nuations for civil, military, and naval services. Pensions 
are ^nted for all sorts of service. Almost every hi^h 
public functionary on retiring from office enioys a pen 
sion from Â£4,000 downward. The Duke of Wellington 
has received successively under the title of " national re- 
wards" the sum of Â£700,000. He had, while premier, 
Â£13,140 yearly. Lord Maryborough, his brother, aa 
master of the hounds, had Â£ 3,000. Lord Cowley, and 
Marquis Wellesley, also brothers, had Â£12,000 and 
Â£4,000. A natural son of the Iast,Â£l^. Another 
brother in the. church, Â£7,000. Ladv Momtnffton. a 
cousin, Â£1,000. Lady Anna Smith, a sister, Â£i^. Her 
husband, Â£1,200. Lord Burffhersh, a nephew, Â£4,000. 
Lord Fitzroy Somerset, a nepbew, Â£2,000. Sir Charles 
Bagot, a nephew, Â£ 12,000. Thus the whole family of 
the Duke of Wellington received Â£62,000 annuallv.

6. Bmib and Orders^ Tbd titled ftobles ooosi3t of (Udm, maiquiaes, earls, visoeuots, and 
binns, called peers. There is also an hereditary order of baronets. Only the peers of England, 
of Great Britain and of the United Kingdom enjo^ the right of sitting in parliament. The 
Scotch aad Irish peers constitute a separate and inferior order, and are represented in the House 
of Lords, those of Scotland by sixteen, those of Ireland by twenty eight representative peers, 
choseo from among their number. The whole number of peers sitting in parliament, ipcluding 
thirty bishops, is about 450. But even more powerful than the titled mobility is the great body 
of landed gentry, including individuals iar superior in wealth to the greater number of the lords, 
aod in the aggregate, much richer than the titled nobles. The merchants and manuftcturers 
oonoitute a tmrd class, which grows more powerful every day. 

7. Amy and Naoy. At the close of the war in 1814, the British army including subsidiary 
troops, exceeded 9l million of men. This embraced the army in India, the local militia, volun- 
teers, &c. The land forces of Great Britain, including their Indian army amount to about 
300,000 men. The only means employed for raising the regular troops is that of voluntary 
tnlistmeot. But in the defence of the country, the militia, coinprising all able bodied men 
between 18 and 45, are drafted by ballot. The marine force of Great Britain, during the last 
war with France, included more than 1,000 vessels, manned by 184,000 seamen. This force 
s moch reduced, and there are now about 200 ships in commission. Sailors are enlisted like 
soldiers ; bat during war, when seamen are in high demand, the odious press-gang is resorted 
to ; that is, sailors are taken by force, in the streets, and from on board merchant ships, and 
compelled to serve on bo^rd the men of war. The royal navy employs about 30,000 men. 

8. Jteveni^. The revenues of Great Britain are immense. The first source of income is 
dÂ» costoms, which yield about 75 million dollars. The second is the excise, or duties upon 
tbe iotemal consumption of various articles, as tea, beer, spirits, soap, candles, kc. These 
produce about the same sum. Next are stamps, and taxes of various sorts, the poundage on 
peDsioos, salaries, &c., widi the post office, all of which yield about 90,000,000. The total 
rerenae amounts to about 220,000,000 dollars. The greatest sum ever raised in a single year, 
was iq 1813 ; this was 470,000,000 dollars. The foregoing statements are for 1840.

9. Dtht. The national debt of Great Britain is 4,100 million dollars. This enormous 
inKMmt has been accumulated by borrowing money, and anticipatingeach year's revenue to pay 
the interest. The debt is of two kinds, funded and unfunded. The unfunded debt consists 
of deficiencies in the payments of government, for which no regular security has been given, 
aid which bear no interest ; and of bills, or promissory notes, issued by the exchequer, to de- 
hy occasional expenses. When debts of this kind have accumulated, and payment is demand 
ed, it becomes necessary to satisfy the demand, either by paying the debt, or affording the 
creditors a security for the principal, and regular payment of the interest. Recourse has been 
ilways had to the latter method, and a particular branch of the actual revenue is mortgaged for 
tbe interest of the debt. Money borrowed in this manner, is said to be borrowed l}y funding. 
The public funds, or stocks, are nothing more than the public debts ; and to have a share in 
fkese stocks, is to be a creditor of the nation.* There are 300,000 holders of public stock 
Â» Great Britain. Three-fifths of the current yearly expenditure are taken up in the payment 
of the iflterest of the national debt.

10. Banks and Currency. The banking system is very extensive, and in no couDtiy in 
the world is the circulation of money so quick and effective. The Bank of England was char 
tered by William and Mary, in 1693, and was at first an engine of government, rather than a 
commercial establishment. It is still connected with the government by large loans. The 
concerns of the public debt, and the collection of the revenue, are in the hands of the bank. 
It has an available loaning capital, of about Â£20,000,000. The system of private banking and 
discounting, is also very extensive. There are, in London, above 70 private banking bouses. 
These hold, in deposit, a large proportion of the active capital of the country. The daily 
payments made to these bankers amount, on an average, to Â£4,700,000. 

11. Taxes, Almost every article of use, convenience, or luxury, is taxed in Great Britain.* 
The annual average tax of every individual in England, including women and children, is X3 
St. That of each individual in England, Scotland, and Wales, taken together, is Â£2 lai. 

12. Foreign Possessions, Great Britain possesses colonies in all quarters of the world, aod 
her vast dominions circle the globe. In Europe, she holds the small island of Heligoland, 
lying opposite the mouths of the Elbe and the Weser ; the Norman isles, on the coast of 
France ; the fortress of Gibraltar, on the Mediterranean coast of Spain ; and the isle of Malta 
with its dependencies, in the middle of the Mediterranean sea. Beside this, the Ionian 
islands, also in the Mediterranean Sea, are under her protection. In Africa, she bas 
colonies upon the coast of Guinea, and Senegambia, the large and valuable colony of the 
Cape of Good Hope, the islands of Fernando Po, Ascension, Tristan d' Acunha, and 8t. 
Helena in the Atlantic, and Mauritius, with its dependencies, in the Indian Ocean. In Amer* 
ica, the vast regions of New Britain, the Canadas, Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island, New 
Brunswick, and Nova Scotia ; the Bermudas, Bahamas, Jamaica, and other West India islands, 
with the Guiana colonies in South America, are appendages of this powerful empire. In Asia^ 
her possessions include the greater part of Hindoostan, with Ceylon, large tracts in Further 
India, Prince of Wales' island, and Sincapore ; and in Oceania, Nqw Holland and Van Die- 
man's Land. The total area of the British Empire has been estimated at upwards of 6,000,000 
square miles, with a population of about 156,000,000 of inhabitants. 

13. Church Establishment. The income of the established church of the United Kingdom 
exceeds $ 40,000,000, being more than that of the established clergy of the whole christian 
world beside. The income of the bishops varies in different years, according to the number 
of fines, leases, &c. The income of the Archbishop of Canterbury, who is primate of all 
England, is about 100,000 dollars, and that of the Bishop of Durham is little less, although pro- 
vision has been made for the reduction of the latter ; that of the Bishop of London is about 
65,000 dollars, and those of the bishops of York, Ely, and Winchester, are above 50,000. 



* *' Taxes apon every article which enters into the month, 
or coTers the back, or is placed under the foot Taxes 
upon everything which it is pleasant to see, hear, feel, 
smell, or taste. Taxes upon warmth, light, and locomo- 
tion. Taxes on everything on earth, and the waters un- 
der the earth ; on everything that comes from abroad, or 
is grown at home. Taxes on the raw material ; taxes on 
every fresh value that is added to it by the industry of man. 
Taxes on the sauce which pampers a man's appetite, and 
the drug that restores him to health ; on the ermine which 
decorates the judge, and the rope which hangs the crim* 
mal ; on the poor man's salt, ana the rich maiTs spice ; on 
the brass nails of the coffin, and the ribands of the bride. 
At bed or botrd^ eouchant or levant, we must pay. The 



schoolboy whips his taxed top ; the beardless youth ntn* 
ages his taxed horse, with a taxed bridle, on a taxed 
road. The dying Englbhman pours his medicine, which 
has paid 7 per cent, into a spoon that has paid 15 per cent ; 
flings himself back upon his chintx bed, which has paid 21 
per cent ; makes his will on an eight pound stamp, and 
expires in the arms of an apothecary, wno has paia a li- 
cense of a hundred pounds for the privilege of putting hio 
to death. His whole property is then immediate]? taxed 
from 2 to 10 per cent Besides the probate, large feet an 
demanded for burying him in the chancel ; his virtues are 
handed down to posterity on taxed marble, and be if then 
gathered to his &thers to be taxed no more.'* â€” > EdaJmrgk

Seretil of the deans also receive from 15,000 to 20,000 a year, while there are several hun- 
dred beaefices, of which the incumbents receive less ihan 200 dollars. There is also a large 
Mimber of parishes without churches or pastors, while there are do fewer than 70 sinecure 



CHAPTER in. 



PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY. 

I. Bmndariea and ExtetU. England is bounded N. by Scotland ; E. by the German 
ocean; S. by the British Channel, separaiing it from France, and W. by St. George's 
Cbaanel and the Jrish Sea, by which it is separated from Ireland. It extends from 50Â° lo 55^ 
iV N. latitude, and from 1Â° 40" E. to 5Â° 40" W. longitude. It contains 68,000 square miles. 
Wales occupies 7,425 miles of this territory, and forms a part of the western coast. 

3. MouiUaini. The general direction of the mountain ranges is from north to south. The 
Cheeiot miU, in the north of England, which is the narrowest part of the island, approach 
within 18 miles of the sea. The Cvmberland Hills are a continuation of the same range-

furtheir soiitli ; ibe Snawd&n range occupies their centre ; aod its chief smniBit is the 
mountain in England, being 3,570 feet in height. The general elevation of these hei^its ia 
from 1 to 3 thousand feet. There are several detached groups in the aoitthem and ceo* 
tral parts of the kingdom. All these eminences, with little exception, are covered with vegfr- 
tation, and enclose many sequestered glens, some of them gloomy and solitary, and others in- 
terspersed with fertile and romantic valleys, affording the most picturesque "scenery. Wales 
is remarkable for the heauty of its mountain landscapes, and the number of streams and lakes 
with which it is watered. Most of the mountains oi England abound in valuable minerals. 

3. Valleys. There are no valleys of any great extent. The basin of the river Severn' is 
skirted by the Welsh mountains on the west, and by some lofi^ eminences on the east. The 
valleys of the smaller streams fire too inconsiderable for notice. 

4. Rivers. The largest river of England is the Sevtm^ which rises near PHnlinunoD, a 
high mountain in Wales, and flows at first easterly, and then south and southwesterly to the 
sea. Its embouchure forms a wide bay, called the Bristol Channel. It is 300 miles long, and 
is navigable in the lower part of its course. The tide rolls up this stream in waves 3 or 4 
feet high. The Thames rises near the Severn, in the lower part of its course, and flows east 
into the German ocean. It is 160 miles long, and is navigable for ships to London, 60 miles. 
This is the most important river of Great Britain 'for navigation. The Mersey is a small 
stream flowing southwest into the Irish sea at Liverpool ; it is navigable 35 miles. The Du 
rises in Wales, and flows northwest into the Irish sea near the mouth of the Mersey. The 
Trent and Owe rise in the north, and by their junction form the Hwnbery which is a good 
navigable stream, and falls into the German ocean. 

5. Lakes. These are small, and would be styled ponds in the United States. They are, 
however, very celebrated for their natural beauty, heightened by cultivation and the charmbe 
country seats around them. The largest, and the greatest number, are in the counties of 
Cumberland and Westmoreland, near the northern extremity of England. Winandermere is 
about 10 miles long, and from 1 to 2 broad ; it contains several islands. Vlstoater is somewhat 
smaller. The handsomest is Derwenttoater^ or Kesmck^ 4 miles in length ; the approach to 
it, in one direction, is embellished by a beautiful cascade. There are many other small lakÂ» 
in this neighborhood. 

6. Islands. The Isle of Wight lies upon the southern coast. Its shape is an irregular 
square, and its surface contains about 270 square miles. A little stream divides it north and 
south, and a cbain of hills crosses it from east to west. The soil is fertile, but the shores are 
rocky. The Isle of Anglesey ^ or *inglesea on the west coast of Wales, is 24 miles long and 
17 broad. That part toward the main land is covered with forests, the ancient sanctua- 
ries of druidical superstition, where barrows and heaps of stones remain to remind us ofits 
bloody ceremonies. The rest of the island is naked, but contains a copper mine, yi^em 
of^ man lies between England, Scotland, and Ireland ; the nearest is Scotland, w^fch is SO 
miles distant. It is 30 miles long, and less than half as broad. A mountain, callefl Snsfel, 
occupies the centre ; the soil is tolerably fertile. Man was long an independent kiijgdom, but 

the sovereignty was bought by the British Government, in 1765, to prevent si^uggling. 
Near the southwest extremity of England lie the isles of Scilly^ known to the ariv^xients by 
the name of Cassiterides. They are 146 in number, but only 6 are inhabited ; i*^jest 
are mere barren rocks. Numbers of druidical monuments are found upon them. ^TSe 
Anglo-Norman islands lie near the French coast, and constitute the remnant of the Brit 
ish dominion over the ancient Duchy of Normandy. These are Guernsey , Jersey, Alder- 
ney, and Sark. The lai^est is 12 miles in length, and they are all well inhabited. 

7. Bays and Harbors. The largest bay is the Bristol Channel, 20 miles wide and 
60 in extent. The Thames, at its mouth, enlarges to a considerable bay. The Wash 
is a wide bay on the eastern coast. Small harbors are numerous iif every part. 

8. iShores and Capes. The shores are generally rocky, and in many parts are com- 
posed of high, chalky cliffs, whose white appearance gave this island in ancient times the 
name of Albion. In some quarters are level, sandy beaches. There are no islands on 
the eastern coast, and here the shore is bolder than on the west A long cape, which 
comprises the county of Cornwall, forms the southwestern extremity of England. Its 
termination is called the Land^s End. 

9. Climate. England has an atmosphere of fogs, rain, and perpetual change ; yet the cli* 
mate is mild. The rigors of winter and the heats of summer axe less felt than on the conti*

aBBt naJn the hum pBiallel. The winds Troiu die sea temper the exireioEs orbeat and cold ; 
the changes, hoirever, are suddea. Weeierl; and southweaterly winds ara most prevalent, 
and also the most violairt. Next are the aortb and Dortheast. The perpetual moisture of the 
mt is sometimes unfavorable to the crops, but its general effect is to cover the whole island 
with the deepest rerdofe. The meadows and fields are usually green throughout the winter ; 
aod Ae tnniieiit snows that occasionallT' ftll upon them are insufficient to deprive them of llieir 
bnDtancjr. Many kinds of kitchen vegetables, as cabbages, cauliflowers, broccoli, and celery, 
often reroain uninjured in the gardens through the winter. 

10. SoiL Ofdii), there is every variety ; but the most coBimon coostiluents of the soil 
Â«e clay, losm, sand, chalk, gravel, and peat. Mossy soils are very common and extensive in 
the northern parts, and here are the widest tracts of barren territory. On the eastern coast 
ve extensive fens and marshes. The moet fertile districts are in the centre aod south. There 
are also very large heaths and pUns, which are nearly unsusceptible of cultivation, and only 
serve for the pftsturiog of sheep. On the whole, England &uy be regarded as not natuiatiy a 
intile country. 

1 1 . Otolcgy. If we pass from Torbi^ in Devonshire, to the Land's End in Cornwall, and 
tfaence nÂ«lbward, along the western aide of Wales to Scotland, we shall find all (he rocks that 
horder the sea, with the exception of a small extent of the coal strata in St. Bride's Bay, and 
near Whitehaven, to be either primary or transition, chiefly the latter. Granite, sienite, clay, 
â– id other slates, and gnuwacke, are here the prevailing rocks. The granite of Corawall *s 
liable to decompoeiiion, and by the operation of time, several singular phenomena have been 
formed here, which were once considered the remains of druidicat su[)er3tition ; such are the 
Cheese Wring, consisting of a heap of large stones, piled one above another, the upper ones 
being so much larger, as to overiiang them on all sides, and the Logging or Logni stones, which 
Â«e so pmsed, as to be easily set in motion. The rocks of the secondary class, however, form 

_ the largest portion of the surface, and the 

districts composed of them are generally 
flat and hilly, never assuming the moun- 
tainous character, unless where the old red 
sandstone or mountain limestone appears. 
From the Tyne to the easiem extremity 
of Kent, and thence along the soulhern 
coast to Devonshire, not a single rock can 
be found, similar to those diat compose 
the whole western coast ; but they consist 
chiefly of red sandstone, magnesian lime- 
stone, beds of grav limestone, called lias, 
and of yellowish hmestone, called oolite, 
Intermixed with beds of clay, sand, and 
.sandstone, and lastly of chalk. Over the 
chalk, in a few situations, there are tertiary 
beds of sand, clay, and limestone, such as 
compose the harder basin. The primary 
rocks yield tin and copper, as well as 
felspar, valuable in the manufacture of por- 
cdain, slates, &c. The lowest secondary 
rocks, contain lead and iron ; higher up, 
are ihe coal measures ; still higher, the 
rock salt ; while the upper secondary, and 
the tertiary beds, are more remarkable for 
their curious orgpnic remains, than for their 
economical value.

der by the rills of water produced bj dw' 
raia. The tin mines of Cornwall are very 
productive, and with those of copper, 
yield a product of 3,000,000 dollars year- 
ly. The coal mines of Newcastle afford, 
annually, above 1,600,000 tons of coal, 
and employ, in the digging and transpor- 
iition, 70,000 men. The copper mine 
of Parys, in Anglesey, consists of tbe 
greatest solid mass of that metal hitherto 
discovered. It is â‚¬0 feet thick, and 
worked in the open air, like a quarry. In 
Cumberland, is a mine of the best plum- 
bago or black lead, in the world. Cheshire 
produces rock salt in great plenty. This 
IS the Liverfiool salt of commerce. 

IS. Animals. The English horse has 
been greatly improved by crossing with 
tbe finest foreign breeds, till in spirit, 
strength, and speed, be is fully equal or 
superior to that of any country. Tbe 
different breeds of sheep, too, have been 
greatly improved, by the care and skill of 
the breeder. Dogs of every variety have 
been naturslixed here ; but the bull-dog is 
said to be peculiarly English, and it pos- 
sesses strength and courage in an extraor- 
dinary degree. Of savage animals, since tbe 
extirpation of the wolf, which was effected 
in the reign of James the Seventh, tbe 
largest and strongest are the fox and wild 
cat. The badger is frequently met with, 
as also the stoat, the martin, of which 
there are two species, tbe otter, the squir- 
rel, and the dormouse. Rats are numer- 
ous, particularly the brown rat of India, 
falsely called the Norway rat, which has 
nearly extirpated tbe native iron-gray rat. 
Mice of various kinds are common. The 
bedgehog is not rare, and the mole is still 
a nuisance in every rich and well -cultivat- 
ed field. The stag is yei found in its na- 
tive state upon the borders of Cornwall, 
and two species of fallow deer are still 
preserved. Hares are abundant. The 
sea-calf and great seal are frequently seen 
upon the coasts, particularly the coast of 
Wdes. 



The larger birds of prey have now almost everywhere disappeared, as indeed they gene- 
rally do, from a country well- cultivated and well-Inhabited. Tiie golden e^Ie is still found on 
Snowdon in Wales, and the black eagle is sometimes seen in Derbyshire ; but the osprey or 
tea-eagle, seems to be extinct. The peregrine or foreign falcon, is confined to Wales ; but 
the various kinds of hawks are numerous all over the country. The largest wild bird is tbe 
bustard ; it is found only in the eastern counties, and weighs from 25 to 37 lbs. ; the smallest 
is the golden-crested wren, which sports in the branches of the loftiest pines. The nighting- 
ale, celebrated for its plaintive tones and extraordinary compass of voice, is confined chiefiy 
to the eastern and middle counties, and is rarely observed to the north of Doncasier. The 
domestic birds of England seem to be wholly of foreign origin ; the poqliry from Asia, tbe 
Guinea fowl from Africa, tbe peacock from India, the pheasant from Colcbis in Asiatic Tur- 



ENGLAND.

key, um] the turkey from America. The Epg}ish reptiles are the frog^ the toad, a species of 
tortoise, lizards of several kinds, and serpents, some of which bi^ve been found 4 feet m length. 
The viper alone is venombus. On the coast are found turbot, dace, soal, cod, plaice, smelt, 
muUet, pilchards, and herring ; the basking-shark sometimes occurs on the Welsh coasts. The 
river-fish are the salmon, trout, the char, the grayling, the samlet, the tench, the perch, and 
many other kinds. Various parts of the coast anbrd shell-fish of different species. The roost 
esteemed oysters are the green oyster from Colchester in Essex, and the white oyster from 
Milton in Kent. According to Pennant, the number of genera of British animals is 10 ; of 
birds 48^ of reptiles 4 ; and of fish 40, exclusive of Crustacea and shell-fish. 

14. Mineral Springs. The most famous are those of Bath, which have been known from 
the time of the Romans ; the Hot Welk of Bristol ; and the Springs of Tunbridge, Buxton, 
Harrowgate, Epsom, Scarboro, Leamington, and Cheltenham. These are much frequented 
by invalids, and that numerous class of wealthy and fashionable idlers, who swarm in every 
place of amusement and recreation in England. 

'5. MUural Productions. A few only of the vegetable productions of England are indi- 
genous. The most useful plants have been imported from the continent. The oak is a native 
tree, and produces timber of the first excellence. 

16. Face of the Country. The eeneral aspect of England is varied and delightful. In 
some parts, verdant plains extend as lar as the eye can reach, watered by copious streams. In 
other parts, are pleasing diversities of gently rising hills and bending vales, fertile in grain, 
waving with wood, and interspersed with meadows. Some tracts abound with prospects of 
the more romantic kind ; embracing lofty mountains, craggy rocks, deep, narrow dells, and 
tumbling torrents. There are also, here and there, black moors and wide, uncultivated heaths. 
The general aspect of Wales is bold, romantic, and mountainous. It consists of ranged' of 
lofty eminences and impending crags, intersected by numerous and deep ravines, with exten

1. Divisions. Ei^land is divided into 40 shires or counties ; and Wales into 12.* These 
are subdivided into Hundreds. The hundred is a division varying in size ; it was established 
probably by the Saxons, originally, it is thought, comprising 100 free heads of families. These 
are subdivided into parishes. Some large parishes are divided into townships. A city is a 
town incorporated, which either is, or has been, the see of a bishop. Every town, that sends 
a burgess to Parliament, is a borough. 

2. Canab. Almost every part of England is intersected by canals. Their total number 
is between 2 and 3 hundred, but many of these are small. Their total length amounts 
at present to more than 2,600 miles. The longest extends from Liverpool on the Mersey, to 
Leeds on the Humber, 130 miles, affording a navigation for vessels of 30 tons completely 
across the island. It has 2 tunnels and manv locks. The Orand Junction Canal extends 
from the neighborhood of London, to the Oxford Canal ; it is 93 miles long, and has 2 ttm- 
nefs ; one above a mile, and the other nearly 2 miles in length ; it has 101 locks. The 
Grqnd Trunk is a part of the same communication ; it is 93 miles in length, and has 4 tun- 
nels, amounting to 2 miles. The â€¢ffshby de la Zouch Canal is 40 miles long, extending from 
the Coventry Canal to an iron railway. It has 2 tunnels, 2 aqueduct bridges, and an iron 
railway branching from it. The Bridgewater Canal is 40 miles in length, and extending from 
the Mersey, divides into 2 branches one terminating at Manchester, and the other at Pen- 
nington. This, with the Trent and Mersey Canal^ forms a communication of 70 miles ; 16 
miles of this canal are under ground among the moimtains. Our limits will not permit us to 
give further details. The canals of England communicate vrith one another, and afford im- 
mense facilities for internal commerce.

3. RaUroadt. There is aa immeitse DUtnber of nulnuds in England. This means of com- 
iBunicatioD has greatly exiend^ \a a few years. Tbe whole couairy is intersected by a not 
work of railroads stretching from London as a centre. Tbe first employment of this species of 
load, on a public thorough fare, for the transportation of passengers and merchandise, was in tbe 
Stockton and Darlington Railroad in the county of Durham, finbhed in 1835; and locomotive 
Seam-engines were not successfully used instead of horse-power until several yeara later. Tbe 
New Casiie and Carlisle Railroad crosses the island from sea to sea. It is 61 miles in length, 
ezclusire of several brasclies. The Liverpool and Manchester Railroad is 30 miles \p lengthy 
exclusive of the great tunnels at the Liverpool end. lliese are excavations, in great part, 
through solid rock, through which the road passes, The Manchester and Sheffield Railroad 
is a continuation of the above, and connects rt with the Cromfurd* and Peak Forest Railroad 
which passes over the Peak of Derbyshire. The Manchester and Leeds Railroad is a 
northern continuation of the Manchester and Liverpool Railway, and is itself connected with 
the eastern coast hy the road from Leeds to Selby. To these, we may add the railroad from 
Liverpool and Birnlinglon to London, a distance of upwards of 200 miles, the Eastern Counties 
Railroad from London, the Western Railroad, from London to Bristol, the London and South- 
ampton Railroad, and many otb^rs. 

The Liverpool and Manchester Railroad, beginning at Liverpool, enters an open cutting 33 

feet deep, with 4 lines of railway, 
and leading to tbe mouth of the Great 
Tunnel, which is 32 feet wide and 
Ifibigb. The sides are perpendicu- 
lar for 5 feet above the floor, and 
surmounted by a semicircular arch. 
This tunnel is cut through strata 
of red rock, blue slate, and clay, 
and is 6,750 feet, or above a mile 
and a quaner, in length. The 
whole extent of this vast cavern is 
lighted with gas, and tbe sides and 
roof are whitewashed, to give a 
greater efiect to the illumination. 

Tbe road in the tunnel curves 
and begins a gentle ascent toward 
tbe east. At this extremity, the 
QrMt Tiamd road emerges into a wide area, 40 

feet below the surface of the ground, cut 
out of the solid rock, and surniounted on 
every side by walls and halllements. From 
this area, there returns a Bmaller tunnel 
towards Liverpool. Proceeding eastward 
from the area the traveler finds him- 
self upon the open rood to Manchester, 
pioving upon a perfect level, the road 
slightly curved, clean, dry, free from ob- 
struction, and the rails firmly Gxed upon 
massive blocks of stone. After some time 
it descends almost imperceptibly, and 
passes through a deep marl cutting, under 
large stone archways thrown across the ex- 
cavation. Beyond this, the road passes 
through the great rock excavation of Olive 
Mount, a narrow ravine 70 feet deep, with 
little more space than suffices for two trains 
of carriages to pass each other. 

After leaving this, it approaches the great 
Roby embankment, stretching across a val- 
ley 2 miles in width, and varying from 15 
tniJbMt. to 45 foet in hei^t. Here the traveler 



ENGLANi). *â€¢ 

finds himself mounted above the tops of ihe trees, and loolta round over a wide expanse of 
cotmtiy. The road then roalces a slight curve, and ascends an inclined plane a mile and a half 
long, b a straight line ; hut the rise is ver^r gradual. BaJf a mile beyond this plane, the Liver 
pool and Manchester turnpike road passes over the railway, on a stone bridge. Beyond this, 
13 an inclined plane, descending as much as the last-mentioned rises. The road then crosses 
a marshy tract, and passes over the Sankey 
valley and cana), by a magnificent viaduct 70 
feet high, with 9 arches, each 50 feet span. 
Beyond this is another bridge, a cut through a 
hill, a junction with the Kenyon and Leigh 
Railway, and a wide marsh called Chat Moss. 
Several other bridges and embankments cerry 
the road into the city of Matichesier. The 
track is double. The rails are of wrought 
iron, laid sometimes on stone, but, where 
the foundation is less firm, upon wood. The 
whole work cost 830,000 pounds sterling. 
4. CitUt. A stranger may approach the city of London by land, or by way of the 
Thames. In either case, everythmg is calculated lo impress him with the vastness of the 
capital which he is about to enter. If he is mounted on the top of a stagecoach, and whirls 
along over the smooth road at the rate of 13 miles an hour, the tiiickening tide of villas aud 
villages, which seem to swim by him on either hand, announce the vicinity of the great 
inetTopolis. Everything now assumes a hurrying, and almost portentous as[fect. Multitudes 
of stagecoaches, loaded with people on the outside, dash by, like the billows that break 
around a whirlpool, or the waters which are about to rush over a cataract. Tilburys, coaches, 
and carriages of various forms are passing and repassing. A cloud of dust hangs over the 
scene, and a loud roar pervades the air. The spectacle has a bewildering effect upon the 
traveler, and weary, dejected, and oppressed, he reaches the city, which he expected to 
enter with delight. The voyager, as be enters the Thames and ascends that river is scarcely 
less affected with the scene. The whole valley on either side is sprinkled with towns, vil- 
lages, country seats, and palaces. The river is tlironged with vessels of every size, and the 
thousands of sails that are spread before the wind, suggest to the imagination, that the great 
metropolis has a magnetic power by which it draws them, from every ocean and every sea on 
the face of the globe, into its harbor. 

London lies on both sides of the nver Thames. It is 7 miles long, 5 miles wide, and con- 
tains an area of about 30 square miles More particularly, it is considered under 3 divisions: 
the City proper in the east, Westminster in the west, and Soulbwark on the south side of the 
river. The buildings are generally of brick. The streets in some parts are wide, and few 
are so narrow as not to admit two carriages 
abreast. At tlie west end they are mostly 
straight, and sufficiently broad for 6 or 6 car- 
rii^es. Here are the residences of the nobil- 
ity and the rich. Regent street, in this quar- 
ter, is probably the most magnificent street in 
the world. In the city, or the central and 
oldest part, the streets are narrow and crooked, 
but here the great business of London is 
transacted. Temple bar is one of the old 
city gates. The east end is occupied by 
shops, victualling-houses, and people con- 
nected with commerce. Here are immense 
timber-yards, docks, and magazines. 

London contains a great number of squares, 
^!^''Â»f<* Btr. the handsomest is Grosvenor square, an area 

of 6 acres, and containing an equestrian statue of George the Second. The buildings around 
it ere the most superb in London. The largest square is that called Lincoln's Inn Fields, which 
occupies a space just equal to that covered by the great pyramid of Egypt. The fibest public 
walks are at the west end ; Green Park, Hyde Park, St. James's Park, and Regent's Park, 
are beautiful fields or gardens, ornamented with trees ; these are the resort of Ihousards who

ualk forexercise or pleasure- These parks are verjKX tensive. Hyde Park coniains 394 acres, 
and, i[i the afiernoon of Sunday, is thronged by crowds of fashionable people, who pour along the 
promenades like the ebbing and tlowingtide. In R^ent's Park is an immense edifice called the 
Coliseum, in which may be seen a panorama of London as viewed from the dome of St. Paul's. 
The gardens of the Zoological Society are also in this Park. They are elegantly laid out, and 
contain an interesting colleclion of rare animals from all parts of the world. Adjoining it are Ken- 
sinetoD Gardens, also a favorite resort ; Vaiixball Gardens are on the south side of the Thames.

columns' above, supporiing a pediment, an entablature representing St. Paul's conversion in 
bas relief, a colossal statue of the Saint at tbe 
top, and statues of the evangelists on tbe 
sides. 'J'he dome, resting on the mass af 
building, is surmounted by a lantern, and 
adorned with Corinthian columns and a bal- 
cony ; the whole is surmounted by a cross. 
The interior of the cathedral does not equal 
its noble exterior. It would be little else 
than an immense vault with heavy columns, 
were it not relieved by monumenial statuary.- 
Westminster Abbey, some distance higher 
up the river, is one of the noblest existing 
monuments of Gothic architecture. The 
south front combines grandeur with grace in a 
VaaahdU OrcAÂ»era. remarkable degree The northern part has a 

magntGcenI window of stained glass, and is very imposing. The exterior of the building is 
perhaps somewhat deficient in that airiness and beauty which distinguish some of the Gothic 
edifices of the continent ; but the interior cannot he too highly estoUed. It is in the form of 
alon^ cross ; tbe roof of the nave and cross aisles is sustained by two rows of arches, one 
above the other ; the lower tier springing from 
a series of marble pillars, each principal pillar 
formed by the union of 1 main with 4 slender 
pillars. It has a vast, airy, and lofty appear- 
ance, which inspires feelings of awe and vene- 
ration. The chapel of Henrj- ihe Seventh, at 
the east end of the church, is unrivalled for 
gorgeous magnificence. The city of Westmin- 
ster and northwestern suburb of London contain 
many splendid modern churches, almost all in 
the classic style. London has few public edi- 
fices compared to its great size and wealth. 
Westminster Hall was once a palace ; here the 
KttimitattT Jihbqi. '''"S^ "f England are crowned and here the 

parliament hold their sittings. It has the largest 
nail without pillars, in Europe. St. Saviour's is a beautiful specimen of the Gothic architecture. 
St. James's Palace is an ill-looking, brick building, but contains spacious end splendid apart- 
ments. A new palace, called Buckingham Palace, is now building in St. James's Park, with 
R triumphal arch in front. The Banqueting Hall, in Whitehall, is tbe remains of a royal pal- 
ace, which was consumed by fire. At Lambetb, on the southern side of the Thames, is the 



S. Ssnrar'f lady Ckt^tL Buckingham Falaet. , 

palace of tbe Archbishop of Canterbury, which has been recently rebuilt at a great expense, 
and with mucb splendor. The Tower, in the aaslern part of the city, is an antique fortraH,

Within iu exiensire walls are comprised several armories, conlainiDg ibe greatest (follecdoB

rOfal menagerie, &c. In the horse armory ere the efiigies of all the English sovereigns, in 
armor and on horseback. The Royal Exchange, ihe Mint, the East India House, the Mansion

great pan of the city in IG66. A stairway in the inside leads to the lop. 

There are 6 bridges over the Thames. Of these, we may mention Waterloo Bridge, of 
granite ; and Souihwark and Vauxball Bridges, of iron. A more remarkable object is the 



TMe amom Boutt. 



Smthina^ Bridga. 
Tunnel, a passage under the river at a 
point where a bridge would be too detri- 
mental to the navigation. This work was 
performed by sinking a perpendicular 
shaft near the river, and working hori- 
zontally under the stream. The labor-, 
ers in this process were aided by a 
frame work, called a Shield, which pre- 
vented the earth from caving in around 
them, and was pushed forward as the 
work proceeded. As fast as the exca- 
vation was made, the tunnel was formed 
by mason-work into two arches ; and 
in this manner the work has been car- 
ried beyond the middle of the river, al- 
thoueh the water has several times 
bitrat through. The enorraousexpensfc 



ENGLAND. ^ 

of the UDdertsking has caused a ttiipea- 
sion of \a progress; but it has since 
been resumed and carried to a success- 
ful oompletion, under the directioa of 
Mr. Bruncll, the architect nbo planned 
it. This tunnel is now in use and exhi- 
I bits a work almost without parallal, 

in ancient or modern times. The en- 
' graving below shows the manner in 

which the tunnel passes under the 
river. 

The wet docks, or basins of water 
surrounded with warehouses for mer- 
chandise, are on a scale commensurate 
with the wealth and grandeur of the 

metropolis of the world. The Wett 

â–  PUatftJuTiumtl. India docks alone, with their basins, 

cover an extent of G8 acres, excavated 
by human labor, and, in- 
cluding the warehouses 
and quays'ailached, cov- 
er an area of 140 acres. 
The East India, London, 
and St. Catherine's docks 
' are also extensive, but 

inferior in size to the 
first mentioned. 

The principal institu- 
tions for education are 
MmntriniMAAtTiimul pmia wider tlie Kaar. King's College, West- 

minster School, Christ's 
Hospital or the Blue Coat School, &c. 
No city in the world has so greats number 
of learned societies, and literary and sci- 
entific establishments, and none can com- 
pare with London in its charities for the 
Sioor, the sick, the ignorant, and the suf- 
ering. Asylums, hospitals, relief socie- 
ties, charity schools, and philanthropic 
associations of every form, combine the 
efforts of the benevolent to alleviate human 
misery. The British Museum is one of the 
richest collections in the world, compris- 
ing works of art, cabinets of natural sci- 
â€ž , ence, and the lareest and most valuable 

library m Great Bniam. 
London has 13 theatres, of which Drury Lane, Covent Garden, and the King's theatre 
or Italian Opera, are among the first in Europe. It has 147 hospitals ; 16 schools of medi- 
cine ; as many of law ; 5 of theology ; 18 public libraries ; 300 elementary fiee schools ; 
1,700 dispensaries, where the poor receive medicine and attendance gratis; 14 prisons; 
and 50 newspapers, printing 50,000 daily. 15,000 vessels lie at a time, in the docks and 
â– I the wharves ; 1 ,500 carriages a day leave the city at stated hours ; 4,000 wagons are 
employed in the country trade ; the annual commerce of the city is estimated at S. 130,000,000 
sterling. 

The' water works, for supplying the inhabitants ivith water, are calculated to exciie wonder 

K their magnitude. The streets are perforated by upwards of 3i)0 miles of main pipes, 

tbrot^ which a daily supply of 30 million eallons of water from the Thames and the iVew 

Rirer is furnished. The city is lighted with gas, which is conveyed through neaHy 400

miles of pipes, commuDicalii^ with 80,000 lamps. Manufactures of all swts are ecmel m 

within tbe preciocts of the metropolis, including every article of elegance or utility. 

The number of ships belonging to this port in 1930, was 2,663, of 672,800 tons ; tod 
the aroouQt of customs collected 75 million dollars. A statement of the annual coniumpti<r 
of several articles of food will help us to form a conception of the extent of the city ; 6 mil- 
lion gallons of milk, 2 million lobsters, 3 million mackerel, and as many herrings, 1 raiUiaa 
liiarters of wheat, 20,000 bogs, 160,000 oxen, and 1,500,000 sheep, form bat a part of (be 
^od consumed here. 

' London presents a striking contrast of wealth, inielltgence, luxury, end mortdity, with igno- 
rance, poverty, misery, and vice. The most disgusting and appalling scenes of Glth tad 
crime, and the most distressing pictures of squalid wretchedness, throw a dark shade over 
this picture of human life. Thousands live by theft, swindling, begging, and every sort of 
knavery, and thousands of houseless wretches here drag out a miserable life, half-fed and bilf- 
clad, and sunk to tbe lowest degree of debasement. 

The population of the ciiy is 1,900,000 ;* 20,000 individuals here rise in tbe morning 
without knowing how they shall live through the day, or where they shall sleep at night 
Sharpers are innumerable. The public beg- 
gars, are 116,000 ; the thieves and pick- 
pockets, 115,000; the receivers of shden 
goods, 3,000 ; servants out of place, 10,000, 
and 8,000 criminals are annually sent to prison. 
It is not a rhetorical exaggeration, but a sta- 
tistical fact, that every tenth man in Londoit 
is a habitual and professional rogue. 

Tbe bead of toe corporation of London ii 
styled the Lord Mayor, and his entrance into 
office is celebrated by the citizens with much 
pomp.

cles, horsemen, and glittermg equipages, and liDed nith handsome houses, so that it is difficult 

for the traveler to deiermine Where the metropolis ma)r really be said to end. Immediately 

above and adjoining Westminster is CktUta, with 40,000 inhabitants, containing the great 

national asylum for invalid soldiers, connected with which is the royal military asylum, for lbÂ« 

education and support of the children of soldiers. Directly north lies ^Tetutn^ton, with 23,000 

inhabitants, the beautiful prdena of which, 

belonging to the palace) * adjoin Kegent's 

Park. 

A few miles further op the Thames ara 
Ktw, containing a royal palace and gardens ; 
Richmond, celebrated for its beautiful park 
and fine views ; Tvickenham, a pretty vil< 
Isge, once the residence of Pope ; and 
/Tampion, containing the royal palace of 
Hampton Court, which is famed lor its fine 
gallery of paintings. A little to the north is 
Harrowon-the-HiU, where there is a well- 
known school or college. 

Twenty-two miles above the metropolis is 
Windtor, containing the magnificent royal 
residence of Windsor Castle, atuched to 
which are the mausoleum of the royal family, a vast park and gardens, and a forest 50 miles 
in circuit. Opposite to Windsor is Eton, with the celebrated college, in which so many dis- 
tinguished men have been educated. Near the latter place is the little village of Slough, 
once the residence of the famous Herschel, who here erected his great telescope, 40 feet in 
length. 

Below London are Deptfordy Gretnwich, and ff^oohnch, now forming one borough, with 
a population of 76,000. JDeptford is noted for its royal dock-yard and immense warehouses ; 
there are also a number of private shi|>-yards, in which are built many merchantmen. Green- 
wich contains the great Naval Hospital for infirm seamen, with which a naval asylum for the 
education af (he orphan children of seamen is connected. It was formerly a royal residence, 
and Queen Elizabeth was born here. Here, also, is the royal observatory, celebrated in the 
bistor; of astronomy for the valuable observations made from it, and for being in the prime 
meridian of English geographers. Woolwich is remarkable for its spacious dock-yard, its \-98l 
â– rsenal for ordnance, including an extent of 6d acres, its royal military academy, its extensive 
barracks, and laboratory,' &c. 

Litcrpool, the second commercial town in England, situated near the mouth of the Mersey, 
is well built, with spacious and regular streets, pretty squares, and handsome houses. The 
public buildings are elegant ; among thetn are the town ball, the custom house, exchange, mar- 
ket, &,c. ; the churches, chapels, and 
meetinghouses are numerous and handsome, 
and the charitable institutions are numerous 
and well conducted. But the most remark- 
able feature of Liverpool is its vast docka, 
of which there are 8, with an area of 93 
acres. These, with the wharves and ware- 
bouses, extend in an immense range along 
the river, while the opposite quarter of the 
town is prolonged into numerous suburbs, 
composed of the villas and country booses 
of the wealthy. The trade of Liverpool is 
; very extensive, being exceeded by no place 

in the world but London. The most im- 
portant branch is the trade with Ireland ;

and of 1000,000 bales imported into England annually, no less than 900,000 are brought into this 
port. 

An extended system of canals opens a water communication with the North Sea, and with 
the inland counties. The shipping belonging to this port, in 1830, amounted to 161,780 iods. 
The manufactures, which are extensive, are chiefly those connected with shipping and the cod- 
sumption of the ii^abitants. They comprise iron and brass founderies, breweries, soap works, 
sugar lefineries, ship-building, watch and instrument making, &c. Population, in 1631, 
165,171, in 1841, including the suburbs, 386,000. Id the beginning of the last century, 
Liverpool was an insignificant village ; her merchants then engaged in the American and West 
India trade, and the growth of the manufactures of ME,nchester promoted its increase. Tbe 
chief portion of the African trade also centered here, and more recently, the trade with East 
India has been rapidly increasing. 

Thirty-three miles east of Liverpool, with which it is connected by a railroad, stands Jtfon- 
ckeiUr, a great manufacturing town, whose population is inferior only to that of London. Tbe 
number of inhabitants is 350,000, or, including Salford and tbe immediate neighborhood, 

296,000. It presents nothing re. 
markable in an architectural point of 
view ; tbe streets are filthy and nar> 
row, tbe houses and buildings in gen- 
eral mean, and the great mass of the 
people poor. It is, however, the 
centre of the great cotton manufgc- 
ture of England, and various other 
mnnufaclures are cariicd on here, 
which consume great quantities of the 
coal abundant in the neighborhood. 
There were upwards of 300 steam 
engines, and 30,000 looms here, in 
]828. 

To the north of Manchester, lies 
BoUon, also a great manufacKiring 
Manthattr town, with 33,000 inhabitants, and 

Rochdails, noted for its great flannel 
manufactures, with 68,000 inbabilanls. To the south is Oldham, with its slate quarries, its 
coal mines, and its extensive cotton and woolen manufactures, and ccntaining a population of 
42,000. AslUon, 46,000 inliabitants, and Stockport, 28,000, also liave exiensive manufactures. 
Birmingham is the second of tbe great workshops of the British empire- Here is made 
every sort of articles of hardware, whether curious, useful, or ornamental, from the more pon- 
derous productions of tbe rolling mill and casting furnace, down to polished watch-chains and 
delicate instruments. Buttons, buckles, trinkets, and jewelry, plated, enamelled, japanned, 
and brass works of every description, steam>engines, pins, swords, and fire-arms, &c.,are 
here produced. The manufactures are upon the largest scale, and constructed with the greatest 
ingenuity. Steam is the chief moving power. The town, although in the centre of the 
country, is connected with tbe difierent coasts by hieans of canals, through which its various 
productions are sent to all parts of the world. The lower part is composed of crowded 
streets and mean buildings, but the upper part has a better appearance. Population, 182,000. 
Wohtrhamplon, about 1 5 miles from Birmingham, is also distinguished for iA extensive man- 
ufactures of hardware. The whole country between the two places, is a little more than a 
succession of collieries, iron mines, forges, and cabins, black with smoke. The borough of 
Wolverhampton includes several townships; the popufaiion of the town is 36,000. 

Leedi, a large trading and manufacturing town of Yorkshire, is situated on a navigable branch 
of the Humher, and is connected with Liverpool by a canal. The old part of the town is

cent's Rock, is celebrated for its mineral 
waters. 

Sheffield is a well built, and flourishing 
manufacturing town, but the smoke of its 
numerous manufactories gives it rather a 
sombre appearance. It is noted for the ex- 
cellence of its cutlery, which is also made 
in all the surrounding villages. The manu- 
facture of plated goods is also extensive, 
and there are numerous large iron foun- 
deries in the town and vicinity. Popula-

branch of the industry of the inhabitants. Population, 17,000. 

Kingtlon-upon-Hall, generally called Hull, stands upon the Humber, and has the greatest 
inland trade of any English port. Its foreign trade Is also extensive, and it is the chief place 
in England for the whale fishery. The harbor is artificial, and Hull is remarkable for its fine 
quays and its extensive docks, which cover an area of 23 acres. The shipping amounts to 
72,250 Ions ; population, 41,000. A few miles above Hull, ,1s the port of Gooh, which has 
recently become an important trading place, by the construction of extensive docks, wore 
liouses, and basins. 

Norwich, an ancient and populous city, has been, for several centuries, noted for its woolen 
manuEactures, to which, in later times, hav* been added those of cotton, linen, and silk. The

Yarmouth, formerly the port of Norwich, has been one of the stations of the British Navy, 
â– nd presents one of the finest quays in the world, upwards of a mile in length. But in conse- 
quence of the obstructions In the navigation of the river Yare, between Yarmouth and Norwich, 
I canal, navigable by sea-borne vessels, has been made from the latter place to Lowestoft, 
whrre an artificial harbor has been constructed, capable of admitting large ships. Population 
of Yarmouth, 24,000.

Portsmouth is the chief naval station in Great 
Britain, and one of the strongest fortified 
places in Europe. The harbor is the first in 
the kingdom for depth, capaciousness, and se- 
curity, being deep enough for the largest ships, 
and of extent sufficient to contain the whole 
navy of England. Tbe famous roadstead of 
Spiihtady between Portsmouth and the Isle of 
Wight, can accommodate 1 ,000 sail of ves- 
sels in the greatest security. Tbe dock -yard, 
which is the grand naval arsenal of Englenil, 
and the general rendezvous of the English fleet,

Pbpttotitk, one of the finest harbors in the world for security and capacity, is also an impor- 
tant naval station. Tlw fortificaltons and barracks are extensive, aud ilie Royal dock-yard is 
OB a very large scale. The Breakwater, a vast mole 1 mite in length, stretching across the 
entrance of Plymouth Road, an Eddysione Lighthouse, built upon rocks lying off in the 
Channel, are the most remarkablft works of the kind in the world. The lighthouse is 80 feet 
in height, yet such is the swell of the ocean, 
caused by meeting the rocks, that it dasbes 
up over the summit of the tower. Popula-

5. ^gricvhun. Notwithsland- 
ing the general inferiority of the 
soil, England is under such ex- 
cellent cultivation, that the coun- 
I try may be considered as one 

' great garden. Farming is, in 

many parts, conducted on a great 
scale, by men of intelligence, 
enterprise, and capital ; and the 
science, as well as practice, of 
agriculture, is carried to a high 
degree of perfection. In the 
northern counties, the farms are 
lai^e, and are leased generally 
for 21 years. In the southern 
counties, the farms are smaller, 
and the tenants are often propri- 
fiOiPta. Tun etors. The field-pea and the

6. Commtrce. The commerce of England is unrivaled by that of any other nation in the 
world. Every quarter of the globe seems tribuiary to the enterprise and perseverance of this 
great commercial people. It has been usual to consider tbe commerce of England as connect- 
ed with that of Scotland and Ireland ; we therefore refer the reader to the view of the cons- 
merce of Great Britain for further particulars. 

7 Manufactures. The manufactures of England far surpass, in amount and variety, those 
of any other nation that has ever existed ; and form the most astonishing display of tbe fruits 
of human industry and skill. The vast numbers of people employed in them, give no ade- 
quate idea of their immense extent, as the gfcat perfection lo which labor-saving machinery b 
carried in England, enables one man to do the work of 150. The cotton manufacture alone 
would have required, half a century ago, 50,000,000 men. The power employed in the man- 
ufacture of collon alone, in Great Britain, exceeds the manufacturing powers of all the rest of 
Europe collectively. The most important branches are cotton, woolen, silk, linen, and bard* 
ware. 

In the northern counties of England, are great manufactures of broadcloth and every other 
kind of woolen goods, principally in the West Riding of Yorkshire, at Leeds, WakeGeld, 
Bradford, Halifax, and Huddersfield. Sheffield has manufactures of cutlery and plated goods. 
Manchester, and its neighborhood, is the great seat of the cotton manufacture. 

In tbe midland counties, are the Cheshire manufactures of silk, colion, linen, iron, and cbjoa- 
ware. The stocking nianufaciures of NoiliDghara ; the woolen of Leicestershire ; the pottery 
of Scaffordshire; the hardware of Birmingham ; the ribands of Coventry ; the carpeting of 
Kidderminster; the broadcloth of Stroud. Flannels are the chief article of Welsh manufac- 
ture. In the southern counties are the cotton, paper, and blankets of Berkshire; the flannels 
of Salisbury; the cordage of Dorsetshire; the woolens of every sort in Devonshire; and ev- 
ery kind of goods, particularly the finer articles of upholstery, jewelry, and every material of 
luxury, are manufactured in and about London. For further particulars, see the general view 
of the manufactures of Great Britain. 

8. Inhabitants. Among the inhabitants of England are very few foreigners, and these are 
mostly in the seaports. The stock of the present English was various : tbe original islanders 
have been mixed at different times, by means of conquest, with the Romans, the Saxons, the 
Danes, the Goths, and the Normans. There are but few of the peopTe called Gypsies, bui 
there are many Jews, chiefly resident in London. Negroes are seldom seen, and what few 
there are, are much prized as servants. They are not degraded in public estimation, as in tbe 
United Stales, and a decent white female is sometimes seen leaning on the arm of a negro. 
In person, the English are robust, and they have clear and florid complexions. Tbe higbisr 
classes, from the prevalence of athletic exercises, are amcmg the best speoimena of the faumas 



ENQLANR lOT 

Inn. OcneraDr, in otber coinUiies, the higher orders are lesfl hardy aod athletic tbao tba 
lower, but it is the reverse Id England. The human race dwindles not, either in mind or body> 
in England. On the whoU, the English may he pronounced the bandsomest and best formed 
people on the face of the earth. Tbey are, perhaps, in the average, nearly an inch shorter than 
the Americans. 

9. CJumi. In Eiigjland, the nobility are a highly privil^ed class. They are comprised b 
tfae IbUoving orders; â€” Dukei, Marquises, Earls, Viscounts, Barons. The Baronets have 
an hereditary title ; the Knights have not. Knighthood is a common regard of public service. 
The Bishops, and otber dignitaries ef the church, consiituta a favored class. The distinctions 
of the two general classes of men, the rich and the poor, are far greater than in other coun- 
tries. The wealth of the world seems to be brought into England, as it once was to Home ; 
but there is no country where poverty is so general and so hopeless. 

10. Drtu. The general costume of the English is neat and convenieBt. In fashionable 
life, the fashions are constantly changing, though more in details than general forms. This 
â–¼ariableness of taste has been expressed in a picture of an Englishman without bis coat, but 
boldiog his cloth and shears as io doubt what fashion to make it in ; or unwilling lo cut it at all, 
lest tfae fashion should change before the coat were finished. The general mode of dress is 
that which we adopt from England, in the United States ; though some of the more eitreme 
bshions do not cross the Atlantic. The Americans, however, indulge in some anomalies of 
dress, that would not be tolerated in London. The changes of English dress seem to have 
been exhausted, and there is nothing new in it that has not once been old. The same gar- 
ments have indeed been used at every era ; and the change operates chiefly on the forms of 
ttiese. At one time the collar is low, at another it is raised ; the skirts are varied in length 
and breadth, and the waist is sometimes long, and at others short. If an Englishman is 
oUiged by change of fashion to sacrifice a good coat for the present, he may lay it by, and 
he sure tlÂ»t in time it will come again in fashion. The mail-coach guards wear the royal 
livery, which is scarlet aod gold. The clergy wear generally a large hat, and some have 
wigs, but the time is past when a wig was "supposed to be as necessary a covering for a 
learoed head, as an ivy buah for an owl." In wet weather the women who go abroad, wear 
clogs, raised an inch or two from the ground, and these make a great plattering on the pave 
raents. In London, there is, every day, a Rag Fur, where the lower class may buy a dress 
according to their means. It is held principally by the Jews, who go about buying old 
clotbes, which diey disf^y at the Fair. The dead are buried in woolen, to encourage agri- 
culture end maoHfactures. . 

The Welsh, though they bare long lived under tfae English government, still remain an 
uomixed nee, and adhere to (be customs of ibeir forefathers. The higher class dress like the 
English ; but in more humble ranks the national 
costume is preserved, which, for both men and 
women, is composed of home-made woolen 
cloth. The coat, breeches, and stockings of 
the men are always blue, and Ibeir waistcoata 
red ; their shirts are of blue or red flannel, ex< 
cept m some parts of the northern counties, 
where they are striped. The common dress 
of the females in South Wales consists of a 
jacket made tight to the shape, and a petticoat 
of dark brown or striped linsey-woolsey, hound 
with different colors. Young women wear mop- 
caps pinned under the chin, and small, round 
felt or beaver hats like the men. The elder 
women commonly wrap up their heads in two 
AttUtu WdA Barftr$ or three colored handkerchiefs, over which 

they put a large felt hat. Both young and old 
throw a scarlet whittle across their shoulders, whicn completes their dress. In North Wales 
the costume is similar, except that the whitde la superseded by a large blue cloak, descending 
uariy to the feet, which is worn at all seasons, even in the hottest weather. Linen is rarely 
ased ; flannel being substituted is its place ; nor are shoes or stockings worn, except some- 
iiBies in fine weather, and then they are carried in the hand, if the woman be going any dis

derstand no other. In general, the English language is preserved in greater purity as spokw 
in the United States, than in England itself. We have, as has been elsewhere remarked, do 
patoii, and our Americanisms are generally words to express something peculiar in our Hate 
of society, and for which there was no previous English word ; while in London, the com- 
mon class of people wantonly perpetrate more outrage upon the orthodox EngUsh, than is 
committed from necessity inthe United States. The language of the cotnmon people ia 
different counties in England, varies so much, that the inhabitants can with difficulty understand 
each other. An American, in Yorkshire, or Lancashire, cannot much better understand the 
common people than if tbey spoke a foreign language. Besides these dialects, the jlaift lan- 
guage, as it is called, is extensively used by gentlemen of the Fancy ; and it is affected by 
many others. It consists in new, and often ludicrous, or witty names, given to everyihiag 
tbai relates to horseracing, boxing, gambling, drinking, and other modes of dissipation. Thus 
the worst crimes have often a pleasant name, and the most shocking scenes are deprived of 
ibeir revolting character by the light language in which they are described. 

13. Manner of Building, Slc. The manner of building among the neb in England, is not 
80 much national, as it is a collection of all that is national in other countries, or of wbst 
remains of former ages. Cosily and magnificent piles of architecture are spread over the 
whole country, and there is scarcely a neighborhood that has not some edifice that attracts the 
visits of travelers. The Gothic, the Grecian, the Chinese, (he Saracenic, the Egyptian, 
and various other styles of building for which art has no name, are found in England. The 

convenience of an English- 
man's house is unrivalled ; 
everything is perfect in its 
kind ; convenience is more 
studied than economy, and 
tbere is not s door or a win- 
dow that is not jointed with 
the nicest art. The very 
farmhouses have an air of neat- 
ness and comfort, that makes 
no part of the picture of the 
farmer's dwelling in the Unit- 
ed States. The walls are 
covered with creeping and 
flowering planls. The roofs 
are frequently thatched with 
straw, and in some of the old- 
er towns, whole streets of 
thatched houses may be seen. 
England is the country o( 
unequal wealth, and the cot- 

contrasted with the mansions 
of the rich, yet if there is luxury in one, there is often comfort in the other. The cottager 
are both of brick and stone, and though small, they are neat. The villages are generally old 
and dingy. Every family occupies a separate house, and a traveler may go far, without seeing 
an old bat in a broken window. On the bouses of the rich no expense is spared. Their 
country seats are generally at some little distance from the road, and they are often approached 
through plantations of trees. The grounds are not fancifully laid out, but art only appears, 
the better to display nature and not to do violence to it. It is in the country mansion that 
the wealthy pan of the English are sec-i to the best advantage, and here tbey lead a life, that 
may well be envied

13. Food and Drink. The ^^ roast beef of old England " * is indeed a pdataole and invig- 
orating food) and it is apity that any should want it ; but the laborer who fattens the ox, sel- â€¢ 
dom tastes the beef. The poorest of the laborers and manufacturers cannot have in the week 
as much animal food as the American laborer consumes in a day. In other respects, the kind 
of food is similar, and the potato is general with both. The price of beef is from 9d. 
to 1$. and 6d. sterling, the pound. Mutton is from Id. to ]0d. Common fowls are from 
S$. to 158. a pair ; turkeys, 10Â«. and 9^. each, and geese, 6$. Butter is from Is. to U. 
M. a pound, and eggs are from 20d. to Ss. a dozen. Rabbits are U. a piece. The common 
wages of a day laborer are Is. 6d. to 2s. Country wages are by the year : Â£15 to Â£20, for 
men^ and for women, from Â£3 to Â£9. The wages of manufacturers are much higher. 

The English consume much more animal food than the French, and the number of sheep 
consuiued in London is about three-fourths more than in Paris. The number of rabbits con- 
sumed is immense ; one person alone, in London, sells 14,000 weekly ; they are sent in from 
all parts of England. Immense numbers of geese are driven from Lincolnshire. Droves of 2 
and 3,000 are common, and even 9,000 have been seen in 1 drove. The poor in Eng- 
land have little beyond the bare necessaries of life, and many are supplied with these by the 
parishes. In seasons of scarcity, there is, what is never known in the United States, a famine, 
and riots are the consequence. The lot of the rich is more enviable ; the commerce of Eng- 
land brings them the productions of every climate, and wealth enables them to rear, even in 
England, the fruits of the tropics. Turtles are brought from the West Indies, and salmon 
packed in ibe from Ireland and Scotland. The growth of peas and other vegetables is forced 
b hot-houses, and peas are often sold at a guinea a quart. The best of pine-apples and grapes are 
produced by careful cultivation. The wines of irorlugal are the most used, from the commer- 
cial relation of the two countries, but all wines are dear. A bottle of the ordinary wine cannot 
be had for less than a dollar, and the pric# is often greater. ^^ Superior-London-picked-par- 
ticular-East-India-Madeira wine " is advertised, and every epithet of it, says Southey, must be 
paid for. Of course, adulterations must be common, and a brisk business is carried on in 
making wines of mixtures which are often deleterious. Cider is much used, and in many 
places it is the common drink. There is a good deal of perry consumed ; but the great na- 
tional beverage is beer or porter. The quantity made is enormous ; Barclay & Co., alone, 
successors to Thrale, pa^o the excise Â£400,000 yearly. Besides the public brewei*ies, 
every good housewife has the art of making good beer.f The laboring classes dine at 1 o'clock, 
but the dinner hours of the higher orders are 5, 6, 7, and 8. 

14. Diseases. Consumptions are frequent, and dyspepsia, with its train of hypochondria, 
more so. It is the Englishman's malady. The gout is perhaps more common than in any 
other country. There are few diseases of a malignant type, and a great many people live 
to the greatest age of man. 

15. Traveling. An Englishman is excusable for complaining of the mconvenjences of 
traveling in other countries, and he should be allowed some license to abuse the accommoda- 
tions for travelers in the United States. In England, the roads are excellent, the coaches 
easy, the speed great, and the inns of more excellence, than is found in any other country. 
The bouses for these are commodious, the furniture good, the servants quick and attentive, and 
the host civil and obliging. All this is crowned with the neatness and propriety of arrange- 



* The beef of England has its reputation from compar- 
ison with that of the continent, which is greatly inferior. 
It is alflo better than the average of the beef in the United 
Slates ; bat the best beef in England is in no respect su- 
perior, and probably not quite eqnal, to the best beef of the 
tTiiited States. 

t.Till the reign of William and Mary, ale was the com- 
â– Mo beverage or the laborin^r class ; but an act for the en- 
couragement of distillation increased the consumption of 
ardent spirits so much, that it was necessary to restrain it 
by anofioer law, and the evil continued till 1751, before 
which, says Smollett, ** such a shameful degree of profli- 
gacy nreyailed, that the retailers of this poisonous com- 
poaid (gin) set up painted boards in public, inviting the 
people to be drank for the small expense of a penny , assuring 
then, that they might be dead drunk for two pence, and 
have straw to lie on till they recovered, for nothing." In 
1827, tha restrictions on the sale of gin were removed, and 



the consumption of it increased, in 2 years, 12,000,000 of 

S aliens. Tne excessive consumption of this deleterious 
rug is indeed a corse to England, and the sheriff of Lon- 
don and Middlesex declared, that he had so long been in 
the habit of hearing criminals refer all their miseries to 
this, that he had ceased to ask the cause of their ruin. 
Were any new and unknown cause to arise and produce 
the same ruin upon body and soul, that ardent spirit pro- 
ducea in England and the United States, it would break 
down the pillars of society, and men would flee to the 
woods and mountains to escape what is more terrible than 
cholera or plague, inasmuch as the power of these ex- 
tends to the destroction only of life. 

There are Temperance Societies lately organized in 
England, which have distributed 100,000 tracts, and the 

Stvemroent no longer furnishes the soldier with spirits 
roughout the provinces, but gives him m place or it a 
penny a day.

niTOt^ Aat diftiagaidi the private dwelfings of the Eng^sb. As these oottreDiences tre lor 
hire, h is but oaturil, that he whose appearance denotes the most weahh, should have the graat- 
6St attention. The traveler who arrives in the stagecoach will not have to encounter such a 
rush of sdnrantt to welcome his arrival as he that comes m a post chaise, and the pedestrian 
may often be left to wait upon himself, if he is even so fortunate as to be admitted to the hotse^ 

There is no kmd of traveling more agreeable than that of posting. The traveler may hire a 
post coach or post chaise with two horses, a^ any of the inns. In fashion, it very much re- 
sembles a common coach, excepting that it contains but two seats, and the body is shaped 
like half the body of a common coach. The usual rate of traveling is about 10 miles an hour, 
but the post boy can easily be bribed to make it 12. The post is about 10 miles, at the end 
of which you get another establishment, which is furnished with great celerity, and you proceed 
as before. This is a very common method of traveling among the rich, who seldom are found 
m the stagecoaches. The English are mclmed lo travel much, and the life of the higher 
classes is almost migratory. It is passed between London, the country, the watering-places, 
and the continent. There are, ^vtn among the yeomanry, few of any substance who have not 
been at London. 

The servants at the English inns are excellent, and indeed all over England ; as it is consid- 
ered no discredit to serve ; and as places are desirable, there is no lack of servants ; still 
even in England, as in the United States, a standing topic among matrons, of the difficnlty 
of finding ^ood servants. At inns, the servants have no wages, and they depend for support 
upon the liberality of the guests ; of coarse they are obsequious and obliging. They are al- 
ways well dressed, and many of them are coxcombs. Some of them give a premium for places 
instead of receivii^ a salary for services. On the arrival of a coach, there is a general rush of 
the servants to assist the passengers in alighting. Two footmen stand at the door, and proffer 
an elbow ; the chamber-maid comes to show the roams, and even ^^ Boots," who gets his title 
from what he brushes, shares in the hospitable impulse. On the departure, the servants 
range themselves in a line, and if any guest forgets a douceur, he is gently requested to rt' 
member the chamber-maid, '^ Boots," &c. Sally, originally the name of an individual, now 
designates a class, and every chamber-maid is called by that name. The English inns are in- 
deed so excellent, that they well deserve the commendation of Sheostone, which is so often 
scribbled upon the wainscot and windows. * 

** Whoe'er has trayeled life's dull round, 
Whate'er his stages tnay have been, 
Must sigh to Uiinkhe still has found 
His wannest welcome at an inn." 

The inns of England, however, are not the hospices of poverty. The alehouses are the 
resorts of the more numerous class, that cannot afford the luxuries of the inns, and they are 
often neat and commodious. A traveler who desires to see the unsophisticated English character, 
will find it more at the alehouse, than at the inns. 

The most common vehicles for traveling are the mail-coaches, some of which cany 4 pas- 
sengers within, and 10 or more upon the top. Others, however, carry more within and without, 
and the roads are so good, that 4 horses easily carry 18 passengers. The mail-coaches go, in- 
cluding stops, 8, 9, or 10 miles an hour. The top-seats are often preferred, as they are 
much cheaper, and as they enable the passenger more to enjoy the beauty of the country. At 
first, it seems perilous to ride at such an elevation, when the velocity is so great, for there is but 
a single iron railing to hold by ; but in a short time the traveler suffers himself to be moved 
with eveiT motion Oi the coach, instead of resisting it, and to feel a perfect security in his ele- 
vation. The coachman is well acquainted with the people who live on the road, whom he sa- 
lutes in passing ; and to the passengers he is communicative and civil. The guard, who rides 
in the rear with pistols at hand in case of need, and a bugle to give notice of his approach, 
is also obliging, and it has grown into a custom for every passenger to give him a shilling ibi 
every 20 miles. The coachman is also paid in a similar way. 

The coaches are of various forms ; some are of a cylindrical shape, and are very long and 
large ; many have names like ships, painted on the pannels, together with the towns throogb 
which they pass. The guard, and sometimes the coachman, wear the royal livery, and the 
whole makes a gay appearance. On the road, each carri^e passes another on the left ; which 
IS better than our custom of taking the right, as it gives the coachman a better chance to see the

The Canals, trhich pass OTer many parts of England, offer a cheap and easy conveyance, 
tnd there are, on the Thames, a great many boats for passengers. More than 4,000 have been 
known to pass upwards on a Sunday. They are sharp and long, and go through the water rap- 
idly. The fare is regulttted by la^ ; the boats themselves are numbered, and the boatmen 
bare a costutne. On Sundays, the outpouring from London is prodigious ; die laborers are 
udigfated to go into the fields ; and the gentry, on that day, often go to their villas. They have lo 
pay, however, on the Sabbath, double tolls. In the cities, there are sedan chairs, which carry 
one person. They are borne by two men by means of poles. They are not now much used, 
except for carrying perso&s who are dressed for oeeastonasef ceremony. 

Besides the modes of conveyance described above, there are huge wagons, fdr passengers 
and mercbtodise. They have 8 or 10 horses, and ihe driver sometimes rides on a poney 
by their side. There ve, in the appropriate seasons, many pedestrian travelers in the picÂ«> 
turesque parts of England ; and they may be seen about the castles, lakes, and mountains, each 
with his umbreUa and knapsack, in search of the picturesque. 

16. Charaehr^ MnnnetSi Cfutams. 

** Pride in their port, defiance in their eje.'* 

This b the descripfioti of Goldsmith, and no one who is acquainted with the people, called by 
the general name of John Bull, will deny that they have at least pride ; this, and reserve, 
are traits in the character of the English, so obvious, that a stranger may see them. They 
are too ungracious to be overlooked or forgotten. An Englishman is so little disposed to 
bold discourse with strangers at ordinaries, cofiee-rooms, or places of amusement, that he is 
apt to consider their address to him, as involving some sinister design upon his purse or dig- 
nity, and if he reply without rudeness, it is in the coldest manner. This trait of English char- 
acter has been somewhat softened in the people of the United States who inherit it, and it is less 
repulsive than in England. A Frenchman and most other Europeans will readily and cheer- 
fully converse, with whatever people he may chance to be placed ; but an Englishman draws 
himself in like a snail from any contact with strangers, add he operates upon the spirit of cheer- 
fulness among them as water acts upon fire. This is partly the efi^ect of pride ; it arises, also, 
m part from the want of that early introduction to society f which is common on the conti- 
nent. An English boy is sent to a distant school, of a republican character, where he is 
thrown upon his own resources ; while a French stripling, under the Care of his mother, is 
conversant with gay and fashionable society. 

It must be admitted, however, that an Englishman has some ground or excuse for pride, 
and that in many European countries he may reasonably have a feeling of superiority. He 
(bek tbat he is a member of that great empire to which Europe looks with respect ; his country 
holds <he trident of the ocean, or at least of the seas that wash the old world. Britain holds thie 
keys of the Mediterranean, controls the commerce of India, and has an empire there ; upon 
her dominions the sun never sets, and all these pour their countless riches to swell the wealth 
of England. The Englishman may also feel, in his own person, some pride, that he is a 
countryman of Shakspeare, Newton, and a thousand renowned names in science, adventure, 
and charity ; he may appropriate to himself a portion of the fame of the Nile, of Blenheim, 
and of Waterloo ; and these are surely some incentives to pride. One of the purest men that 
ever lived,, and himself an Englishman, declares, that it is distinction enough for the ambition 
of a moderate man, 

** That Wolfe's sre&t name 's cotemporal with his own, 
And Chatham s language is his mother tongue." 

But this propensity of an Englishman to rate highly his own merits, and the dignity of his

^oontry, is connected with the less excusable practice of undemting the merits of othen. 
It was an unsophisticated expression of Mr. Bull, that, for aught he could see, ^^ all foreignoi 
are fools : " and the English comedies abound in this trait. Were the French, or the people 
of the United States, known to others only from the description of the English, the French 
would be considered as universally vain, unstable, and insincere, and Brother Jonathan would 
be even less /avorably esteemed, as a selfish, coarse, and boastful demi-savage. 

In truth, it is the unreasonable national pride and vanity of the English, that make them 
so intolerant to a spark of the same flame m others ; were they not more proud, they 
would not be moved by the harmless pride of others. This spirit is seldom allayed in an 
Englishman by a visit to the United States, or by a favorable description of this republic. If 
he but hear a farmer in New England express his contentment in livmg under a governmeDt of 
equal rights, he looks back to his own country, and because he was not oppressed there by 
poverty or the laws, reflects not that others were ; or he is stung by the honest Yankee's re- 
marks, because he remembers that there are in England, taxes, game laws, and a code of 200 
capital crimes. An Englishman in our country, nothing can satisfy ; he loses both his sense 
of justice, and his desire to be just ; his judgment may be convinced, but not bis will. The 
more he is courted, the more hospitably be is entreated, the higher does the spirit of rebuke 
and sarcasm rise within him. Yet one of the most intolerant of British travelers has remarked, 
that though he oftentimes provoked the national pride, and sometimes sought to wound, be 
never saw an American out of temper. 

The political intolerance is far greater in an Englishman than the religious, and he will 
sooner forgive in us an erroneous religion, than a sound and prosperous government. An 
Englishman loves and venerates the very nam^of old England ; but it is a pity that so good a 
principle as patriotism should ever be severed from justice, or that of two countries of the 
same stock, and so much alike, an Englishman should ^^ love the one and hate the other." He 
is indeed placable to an individual, but a nation it is harder for him to forgive ; and the authors, 
the statesmen, the philosophers, the clergy, and the people of England, cannot yet forgive the 
descendants from their ancestors, for thriving under an independent government, and for hav- 
ing been the first to break forever the charm of Britain's naval invincibility. We are not weU 
pleased, that the brothers of the house whence "we sprung, should hold us as aliens and ene- 
mies, or underrate and revile us. It is not our fault, that an Englishman is not received in 
this country with more favor than any other stranger, or rather, not like a stranger. For- 
merly it was a passport tp esteem, that a man came from England, but we are now obliged to 
require some better title. In the English character, however, though there are some unfavor- 
able and ungracious points, it is but fair to balance them against some other peculiarities of 
character in other countries. 

The institutions of England are not only favorable to liberty, but they are such as develope, 
in a great degree, individual character, and prompt the intellect to its highest and boldest flights. 
The higher classes of the English may, and will compare with any body of men on earth, for 
elevated and honorable sentiment. The road to distinction is also open to all, and it is not 
possible, in England, for authority to depress the aspiring. Power would, by attempting it, 
defeat its object, and raise him whom it intended to oppress, by interesting public opinion m 
his favor. The seats of honor are for those who will " come and take them." There is suf- 
ficient incitement to ambition, perhaps there is too much ; a coronet for himself and bis descend- 
ants for ever, is the glittering prize before the fancy of the subaltern, as he mounts the breach ; 
and this, too, animates the sailor to moor his ship against a battery, or this also may sustain the 
student in threading the mazes of the law. Yet, where there is such distinction of classes, and 
such inequality of wealth, as in England, the best of life is for the higher orders,* and we re- 
publicans may well prefer for ourselves and posterity, a country where one grade comprises 
the whole people, and where, if there are no privileged classes, with inalienable wealth and 
hereditary titles, there is a more general and equal difiusion of knowledge, prosperity, and hap- 
piness, among all. It has been abundantly shown, that a government of equality can supply a

eidjehteDed is better than titles, and history is more just than heraldry. 

Thoueh there are many grades of dignity in England, there is a certain arena in society in 
which aU gentlemen are equal. The title of a gentleman is not to be defined ; yet it is under^ 
stood m England even by the vulgar.* No rank, under that of Majesty, has been held sacred 
enough in England, to ti&e away the accountability of an insult ; and a son of the king has 
been held by a subject answerable in the field. The nobility of England are not, generally, 
ostentatious. They dress more plainly than the tradesmen, and their houses in town are ei- 
temally neither showy nor grand. They are like the houses of the thriving merchants of Bos- 
ton or Philadelphia, and not like the palaces of the bankers at Rome and Naples. Iil the 
country, however, the mansions are often more costly, and here is the place to test the boast- 
ed, but decaying '^old English hospitality."!

fagri^ in mmj gainful eaMloyment. In this sense, the 
term rather indicates a man s condition ; while in Ameri* 
aa, we use it rather as applyins to character. 

t We subjoin an account of the manner in which an 
fiafiiah nobleman usually passes bis time. Owing to the 
moetinf of Parliament, the London season, as it is called, 
lakAephee during the finest months in the year. No sooner 
has the spring begun to put forth her blossoms, than car- 
tinges and four may be seen hastening in every direction 
towaids the metropolis. Green fields are eicnanjgfed for 
mnrikf streets, the lowing of eatUe "(or the voices of 
statesmen, and the eong <m the lark for the warbling of 
Pasta or Sontag. The noble mansicms in Cavendisn or 
Graevenor Square, and the elegant &brics of Park-Lane 
add Mar-Fair, whioh all winter have looked forlorn and 
drsnteo, now begin to assume an appeaianee of business 
and nyeiy. The unmarried nobleman usually hastens to 
Ins mrorite hotel, in Berkeley or St James's Square, 
iUtonarle street or PieoadiUy. The bowingwaiters wel- 
aeme the arrival of the eoroneted britschka. The Morning 
Poet announces his Lordship's arrival, and his fashionable 
frieods hasten to welcome his return to the metropolis. 
In Â«B ioeredibly short period, his table is covered with 
petitienB from authors who request the permission of ded- 
â€¢eafiBg their works to him ; from actresses who request 
has patronage on a benefit ni^t; from half-starved 
yoonger aoos wishing for promotion in the army or navy ; 
from men out of place who are desirous of preferment ; 
tiekets ibr Almaeks, tradesmen's bills, showers of invita- 
liona, letters from bis agents, from his steward, Ac It 
is seidona, that the noble lord has either time or inclina- 
taon to attend to these multifarious matters. While tak- 
mf kie dKicolate in dressing-gown and slippers, he opens 
a lew, answers those from ladies, commits a portion to 
the flames, and intrusts the rest to the discretion of his 
secretarf or confidential valet 

If he ie a man of political consequence, his society is 
eeorted by men in power, by ministers to whom his vote 
tmw be of service, and who endeavor by invitations to 
their sefect dinners, and other marks of attention, to draw 
htfli eiver to their partv. If Parliament has met, his lord- 
ship drives to the House of Lords, and takes his seat 
among his Peers. When the debate is over, he mounts 
his bone* and ffallops to the Park ; renews his acquaint- 
aaee wkh the bdies of his own circle ; makes hb appear- 
anoe at the windows of the most fiwhionable dub ; cnooses 
his box at the opera ; patronixes the new singer, or ballet 
V, and repairs from thence to a select supper at lady 
-7*e, or |Â»erhaps terminates the evening bv disposing 
â€” of his loose cash at Crockford's. A sair6e at

tion of the curious. The furniture of the boudoir is com- 
posed entirely of Indian shawls of immense value. The 
chairs and sofas are covered with the borders of these 
shawls. All the toilet ornaments are massive gold ; and 
pages dressed in pink and silver are in constant attend

mansion to an hotel. His society is more extensive, ^ei 
more recherehie. The duke of D., though an unmarried 
nobleman, yet being of a certain B|;e, and possessed of a 
stupendous fortune, is in the habit of giving balls, sup- 
pers, and private theatricals, to which ladies of the higii 
est rank consider it a distinction to be invited. They do 
not even expect his grace to exert hb memory so fur as 
to call upon them, but leave their cards with his porter, 
who inscribes their names in his book. It is also the 
duty of a nobleman to attend the levees and drawing 
rooms at court, on which occasions he displays every 
possible magnificence in dress, eooipaffe, ana liy cr ie s .

The ncbilUy are, generaDy, on more familiar terms with the tenantry and the poor, who 
find them more easy of access, than retired merchants or manufacturers. The servants of a 
household are frequently born, and often die, in the house. The coachman, like Sir Roger 
de Cover!/ 's, is gray-headed, and the buder's son is often the companion or tutor of the young 
heir. 

Much has been said of the English phlegm, yet this is not so much a want of feeling, as a 
suppression of the marks of feeling. Besides, it is now the fashion to afiect an utter nonchal- 
ance. An English fashionable would feel sh|ime if any exclamation of passion should escape 
him ; everything is transacted with the most imperturbable coolness, whether a duel or a dance. 
This frigid demeanor would have little favor at Pans, where everything is carried by enthusi- 
asm, or the affectation of it. It is said, that an English lady of rank asked one of these stoics 



winei. The yillafera rejoice at seeing the curlingr smoke 
once more tscendfrom the chimneys of the great house. 
The ga^'iekeepen clean their rusw firelocks and shot 
belts. The grooms look well to the condition of their 
â€¢tud, and the gardeners arrange their hot^houses, con- 
servatories, and pineries for mj lady's approbation. The 
fiimily seat of an English nobleman usually combines 
ancient grandeur with modern elegance. 

The principal entries are guarded by gates of solid iron, 
with porter's lodges constructed with much taate; some- 
times oastellaced to suit the architecture of the house 
itself, or low Grecian buildings with rows of marble 
pillars, entwined with jasmine and roses. The avenue 
winds through the park, which is a vast inolosure, fre- 
quently 20 miles in circumference, and adorned with 
pcattered clumps of noble trees, oaks which are the 
growth of centuries, 



** And oaks, as olden as their pedigree. 
Told of their sires, a tomb in every tree. 



t* 



Summer-houses, cottage-omees, and temples are scat- 
tered in ever3 direction. Perhaps a noble river winds its 
course through the grounds, witn wooded banks sloping 
downwards to its brink ; or a broad, transparent lake with 
islands and pleasure-boats, adds to the variety of the 
scenery. Numerous herds of deer may be seen lying un- 
der the forest-trees, startling at the sUghtest sound, and 
sweeping by to hide themselves in the thickest shade. 
Then there are gardens with heated-walls, shrubberies 
and plantations of vast extent, green-houses and hot- 
houses, ^peries, pineries, and aviaries. But little rural 
beauty is enjoyed by the proprietor of the estate. The 
flowers have faded, and the leaves grown yellow with the 
autumnal tii*% before fashion permit him to pay any 
lengthened visit to his country seat. Within the mansion 
there are long suites of rooms, furnished with all the re- 
finement of modem luxury, turkey carpets, low ottomans, 
damask hangings, and walls draped with silk, and pan- 
neled with mirrors; statues, vases, and candelabras, ta- 
bles of mosaic and or-roolu ; long galleries, and huge 
halls which retain a more ancient and feudal taste ; the 
walls hung with family-portraits, descending from gen- 
erations long since passed away, barons in steel, and 
ladies in antique court-dresses ; judges in ermine, and 
generals in armor; beauties from the pencil of Vandyke 
and Sir Peter Leiy ; frequently mingled with paintings 
firom still greater masters ; Claude Lorraines, Titians, and 
Salvators. It might be thought, fVom the heterogeneous 
mixture of guests assembled at the nobleman's villa, that 
little harmony would subsist among them. But there is 
one rule observed by the host whicn is seldom broken in 
upon. He never interferes with the pursuits of his guests, 
but leaves them to follow the bent of their own inclina- 
tions, whether grave or gay. 

The man of uterature and the sportsman, follow their 
respeotives tastes undisturbed. Here is a library for the 
studious, music rooms for the lover of harmony ; for the 
iut there b a gallery of paintings, and billiaids 



eonnoi 



for those who prefer that amusement. Horses ready sad- 
dled are at the disposal of all who wish for exercise ; and 
numerous servants are ready to attend the call of those 
who lemain in their apartments^ and prefer their own 



society to that of others. If the morning is fine, and 
fitted for the enjoyment of the chace, his lordship liset 
betimes and joins the sportsmen. The court now pre- 
sents an animated scene ; there are game*keepers , gen- 
tlemen in shooting-jackets or hunting-coats; grooms 
giving gentle exercise to the hunters; rveyhonnds m 
leashes ; pointers, 6lc, A substantial breaxl'auit is spread 
for the keen appetite of the sportsmen The side-tables 
are covered with game, cold meat, and wipe. A hasty 
breakfast is interrupted bv the shrill blast of the bom. 
The huntsman rides rouna at the head of his yelling pack 
of fox-hounds, cracks his whip, and calls eacn dog to or- 
der by name. The nobleman and his sporting guests 
hurry out. mount their hunters, and gallop afler the 
hounds. But, if the morning is dark and rainy, and no 
sport can be enjojred out of doors, other amusements are 
resorted to. The breakfest-room is filled with idlers and 
loungers. The first interesting moment is the arrival of 
the newspapers and letters. The eagerness with which 
the bag is opened, and the avidity with which its con- 
tents are received, would lead one to suspect, that wher- 
ever the guests may have strayed, their thoughts are in 
London. As his lordship enjovs the same liberty that he 
leaves to his guests, he probably passes the morning in 
his apartment, receives his steward, looks over his bills, 
listens to the complaints of his tenantry, or consults with 
his architect in regard to the repairing or embellMfaing 
his mansion. Perhaps an hour at billiards, or a visit to 
the stables, passes away the time till luncheon, whert 
the ladies meet to eat. and the ^ntlemen to look at them, 
for no true gourmand will spoil his dinner by an inter- 
vening meal. But the dinner hour in the country is the 
time for sociability, when English reserve thaws, when 
the company meet together probably for the .first time in 
the day, and the courteous host presides at his table with 
the cares of the morning erased from his brow. 

The lar^ hall is brilliantly lighted up, and a cheeriful 
fire blazes in the grate. The tables ana sideboard shine 
in all the luxury of massive gold plate, with the fiunilv 
arms emblazoned in every direction. The refined French 
cookery is mingled with more solid fare for the hongiy 
sportsman and the country squire. The conversation 
sparkles like the champaigne; and brilliant wit, which 
had been corked up all day, now flows unchecked. In 
the evening, the long suite of rooms are in a blaze of 
light, and me delicate exotics of the conservatonr shining 
in the light of the lamps produce a kind of artificial sum- 
mer. Music end dancing, cards and conversation am 
resorted to bv turns. The sportsmen recount their feats ' 
the gourmand discusses tlie merits of his dinner ; the pol 
itician^ sit m a nook apart, calculating upon the prob* 
abilities of a continental war. The company usually disÂ» 
perse by midnight, the ladies to recruit tneir looks for the 
next London season, the gentlemen to recruit their 
strength for the next pheasant bottue, or fox-chase. 
When the sporting season is over, the guests disperse, 
and his lordship is left at liberty to dispose of his time, 
either in remaining to cultivate the acouaintance of his 
country neighbors^ or in visiting his other estates. The 
Christmas ^tivities bring a renewal of country gayety. 
A tour to the continent frequently disposes of the remain* 
ing months tiU politics and pleasure lecaU the nc^le kwd

of the sdooos to dance witb her frieoQ, â€” <' Well, trot her out," was the characteristic replj. 
In England, as well as in Europe generally, the life of young, unmarried females is one of 
seclusion. Marriage is there the state of freedom, and a matron is held to a less strict rule 
of life, than a maiden. In the United States, this principle is reversed, and the effect is not 
ivfaForable. 

^ The English have reduced convenience and comfort to a system unknown in other coun- 
tries. Every piece of furniture is perfect in its kind. The table furniture is costly, and the 
windows and doors are joined with the utmost nicety. The very grate is made to shine like a 
mirror, and it is commonly of some elegant form. li is an Englishman's delight to stir the fire, 
as it is also the pleasure of his transatlantic brethren. The two great practical philosophers of 
New England, Franklin and Rumford, speculated much on the principles of stoves and fire- 

! daces. In America, where wood is the general fuel, the amateur often takes down the whole 
abric, that he may build it up in a better form ; but the Englishman's operations are more 
simple, and he confines them to giving his sea-coal fire, a ^^ rousing stir." In New England it 
has been said, that serious domestic disputes arise from the question of the privilege of moving 
the fire. It is certain that a countryman, whoever he may be, who discovers a brand that may 
be better placed, will seldom fail to exercise his benevolence in putting it right. The Eng-* 
lisb are a domestic people, and there is a vast amount of quiet happiness in England. The 
business of the day is concluded before the social hour of dinner, and the cares of the world 
are dismissed for the night. Dinner is the principal meal, and it is not swallowed in the 
ravenous haste that is so common in America. 

The hours of the fashionable world in London, for London is a world, are those of night, 
and all the night. At ten, there is a constant roar of carriages, and it subsides not till long 
after midnight. The fashionable assemblies and routs are crowds, so dense, that it is hard to 
penetrate them, or to escape from them. The houses are often stripped of furniture to the 
garret, the better to conuin the ^^ troops of friends," who come on a previous mtimation, that 
the hostess is *'at home." There is here a confusion of tongues, but little conversation. 
The rooms are in a blaze of light, and the shutters thrown open for the gazing crowd in the 
streets. When an American in London invited half a doaen friends in an evening, the ser- 
vants opened the blinds, thinking it to be a rout after the American mode. In London, it is the 
Dombers, and not the enjoyment, that give eclat. 

On particular occasions, the English dress with great splendor, and the ladies are often 
oppressed with the weight of jewels and diamonds.* Bat in general the linen drapers, mer- 
cers, &c., are the finest dressed persons about London. The 
E" . II court dress is in fashion that was general 70 years ago. The 

& coats are without collars, and have wide sleeves and broad skirts.

'^'" ^ There is in England such a commercial competition, that a 

tradesman's arts are numerous, and his perseverance infinite, 
to attract customers. The shops are in themselves a show, and 
the contrast of colors, and arrangement of goods, are managed 
with muqh effect. The system of puffing is of course as well 
understood as in the United States ; but it is practised with more 
delicacy and effect ; it is not so directj and the puff is often con- 
En^itk tained in a sort of practical metaphor. A pair of shoes are seen 

^ ' at a window, floating in a vase of water, to intimate that they are 

water-proof ; and at another vnndow is seen a wooden leg, booted and spurred, to show that 




* In the establishment of an EnsUsh gentleman^ the 
nen'serrants are divided into two distinct classes ; ser- 
â–¼anti in Uvery, and servants out of livery. The ser* 
Tanti who wear no livery, and who are considered superior 
to the others, are the butler, the underbutler, and the 
fentleman^s valet. The livery servants are the coach- 
laao, the footmen, and the grooms. To all families of 
â€¢â– y consequence, a certain livery belongs. 

A livery it a coat and small-clothes of a particular color 
tadstnir. The coat is of fine cloth, and the â– mall-clothet 



of plush. Some wear a silver or ^old epaulette on the left 
shoulder, or an ai^ilette, which is a Ions silver or gold 
chord depending from the shoulders, and looped upwHh a 
gold or silver pm ; also a hat with a gold or silver band. 
When the fanuly is in mourning, the footmen wear black 
livery with a black epaulette or aiffuilette on the shoulder. 
If the master of the house is a nmitaiy man, or the lord- 
lieutenant of a county, his footmen wear black cockades in 
their hats. There is one livery which may be adopted by 
any family, as belosging U> no peculiar one ; this is a

si|oii legs an ntde widun to fbe life. Happy is the tradesman who eaa onspli^ over his doori 
the ensigDs of royalty, as hatter, cutler^ &c., to the king. There are a great many tradesmen 
thus favored, and there is a sign of ^^ privileged bug-destroyer to his Majesty," and another, 
<' vender of asses' milk to the Duke of York." In a monarchy, the favor of the sovereign is 
the road to wealth. It is also a great desire with a London tradesman, to have a ^^ country- 
box " in some of the villages about the metropolis. 

In Endand, as Trinculo says, ^^ anything passes for a show," and the national curiosity 
flnds gratincatton in the numerous spectacles of London. Some of these are peculiar, others 
are common to all cities. A shaven bear^^ dressed in a robe and turban, and made to sit up*> 
right, was once shown as an Ethiopian savage ; and a small monkey, shaven and shom, wai 
dressed in green, and successfully exhibited as a fairy. An exhibition was made, too, of the 
fork belonging to th^ knife, with which Marjgaret Nicholson intended to kill the king. Quackery 
is in England, as in America, a certain way to wealth, if followed with sufficient zeal and im* 
pudence. There is no country that produces so many humorists as England, or so many per- 
sons who grow up with marked peculiarities of character. Men generally, in roost enlightened 
countries, are much assimilated ; but in England, the impress of the medal is often entire, and 
there we find the strangest whims and caprice^ as boldly acted upon as if they were general 
principles. 

CM* course, there are some few contradictions in the English character. The people are lib- 
eral ; yet there is hardly a museum, collection of pictures, or national monument open to the 
public, where there is not some douceur to be paid to the attendants. An Englishman at 
Genoa or Florence, is Sensible to the ridicule that should pertain to the grandees for selling oiler 
wine at retail, in the basement of their palaces ; yet, when he does not occupy for the evening 
bis own opera box, he wilf let it out for hire. All classes of society, too, are fond of specular 
tk>B ; agd many who would soora to be directly connected in trade have yet an interest in bank, 
tailroad, and other joint-stock companies. There is scarcely any person of property who is not, 
id some isense of the word, and to some extent, a trader. The property of many of the leading 
ftmilies was acquired by trade.

Imd retort as if they were sailors and porters. As the stranger passes along through the town^ 
he sees a multitude of women abroad, most of them without any other head-dress than a 
cap, and carrying bundles, or going in haste, as if on business. He proceeds to the regetaUs 
market, and there he finds it almost exclusively attended by women ; many of them with in- 
fants in their arms, or laid on the floor at their side. The traveler proceeds on his way to 
Manchester, and on the public highway, in the meadows and fields, and in every street through 
which he passes, ne still sees women of the lower class abroad, attending to various occupa- 
tions. Instead of shrinking from the gaze, as American women of the same class would do, 
they look the coachman and passengers boldly in the face, and seem not a whit abashed atim*' 
pertinent looks, and more impertinent speeches. At Manchester and at Birmingham tb* 
tvomen are seen engaged in various kinds of severe bodily labor. Not only are the madulho* 
tones filled with them, but in some instances they drive the horses atteched to the drays, work 
iron in the smithies, and shovel coal to feed the fires of the steam engines. Tliese wometi ar^ 
in the constant habit of mixing with the men, and it is perfectly obvious, that they can possess/ 
no part of the delicacy and modesty, which are- so common, and so nearly universal, alnongth^ 
humbler classes of females in our country. 

There is a correspondent difference in the condition of the females of the higher clashes of 
England and America. The women of the middle ranks, as well as the ladies of qudity id 
England, are more accustomed to mix freely in the society of the other sex. Their lives are 
less secluded, less domestic. The married ladies, in particular, are less confined to the soci- 
ety of their husbands, and often mingle in matters of business, which are here left exclusively 
to men. If the English females are therefore better acquainted with the world, they are infe- 
rior to ours in delicacy. The rules of decorum in their state of society are somewhat relaked, 
and topics, which would here be considered improper, are fireely discussed or alluded to, a|{ 
legitimate themes of conversation, between the sexes, there. But if our ladies have Ae ad- 
vantage in natural delicacy, we must admit that, in artificial refinement, those of England sitf- 
pass them. Their education is more thorough ; their accomplishments more numerous and 
perfect. In the art of conversation they excel, and bestow upon fashionable society that ex- 
quisite polish which is never found here. 

The crimes most common in Endand are frauds, though there are many of violence. In 
London, the pickpockets are proverbially adroit, and they are seldom idle in a crowd. There, 
too, it is common, before a family retires to rest, to place bells so, that they will be rung by 
the entrance of house-breakers. The thieves and rogues about London form a large com- 
munity, and they have a peculiar language, called St. Giles's Greek. ^^ To nab a kid." is to 
steal a child ; to be " twisted " or ** scragged," is to be hung ; and execution is the " sneriff 's 
ball," and Newgate is the " bower " or the '* stone pitcher." To " stifle a squeaker," is to 
murder a child ; to **rap,"is to swear falsely ; ** Philistines," are bailifl^s ; " persuaders," ajie 
spurs ; '^ one in ten," is a parson, and an ^^ amen-curler," is a parish clerk. In Cornwall, the 
wreckers have often an opportunity to pillage, but they consider the plunder of the sea as 
lawful. The y a re not cruel ; they relieve the mariner, and they rob him as gently as they can, 
or like Isaak Walton, when he hooked the fi*ogs, ^^ as though he loved them." A miner^ 
life, however, is not so easy, that he would not be much tempted by the wreck of a ship. It 
IS said, that the clergy there do not know half their parishioners, till they come up to be buried. 
It is probable, that most of the stories of the wreckers have as little foundation as the current 
tales concerning our honest fishermen of Cape Cod. 

There is in England one peculiarity, characteristic of the state of society, which is the mob, 
the incarnation of John Bull. It is, in general, by no means malicious, though it is absolute. On 
seasons of rejoicing, it breaks the windows that are not illuminated, and it breaks the windows, 
also, of obnoxious persons. There is no regular organization, yet there seems to be some 
general mind or inteiTigence in the collective body, which usually acts with discrimination. In 
the United States we have no mob ; there is not even a probability that we ever shall have one, 
bat if we should have, it is not probable, that it would be more moderate or restrained than sim- 
ilar assemblages in England. 

There is no country with so many princely, charitable, and religious foundations as Eng- 
land ; but generally they are the growto of ages, and many of them have existed for centuriel.

It is odIj in a country where property is secure, that such coidd exist. It is surely a BoUe 
disposition of wealth to leave it to charitable corporations, where the testator may live forever, 
if it be life to do as much posthumous good to the end of time, as he could have effected had 
he really been immortal. On the whole, in the English character, if there is not a little to 
censure, there is much to praise ; and nations must be judged in the same indulgent spirit at 
mdividuak ; neither can arrogate perfection ; and of England we may well say,

The manners and customs of Wales, are somewhat dissimilar to those of England. The 
Welch are extremely national, and though their country is not fertile, they are greatly attached 
to their barren hills. It is not common to see in America, the great centre of emigration, a 
native of Wales. The temperament of a Welchman is somewhat ardent. He is industrious 
and frugal, and history attests that he is persevering and brave. The vale of Clwyd, which is 
one of the most charming on earth, is several miles in extent ; and it is remarkable for being 
the residence of only the wealthy. The laborers that dress it like a garden come to their toil 
a distance of several miles, for the lords of the soil, it seems, are unwilling that the cottage of 
the poor should rise near the palace of the rich. The improvements of modern life make their 
way in some parts of Wales more slowly than in any other corner of the island. The Welch 
have retained, also, their own language, and a few harpers are yet still found wandering about 
the country. 

It is impossible to pass through Wales, however, without the conviction, that it is one of the 
happiest countries in the world ; the people give the traveler a cheerful nod, and they are ex- 
tremdy neat in their personal appearance and dwellings. Every cottage is white-washed till it 
is of a resplendent whiteness. Every cottage, too, has its roses, honey-suckles, vines, and 
neat walk to the door. There is no doubt that the same grade of people in the United States 
have more wealth, but it is certainly an indication of a mind at ease, and of habits of neatness 
and order, as well as of comfort, to have the humble dwellings of so much studied neatness 
as in Wales. 

17. â€¢Slmu$emeni9. The English are not a cheerful people, though they have many amuse- 
ments, and some of them are peculiar. Some ancient sports that used to be pursued with 
zeal, are now disused, and others have grown into favor. The invention of |unpowder has 
destroyed hawking and archery ; and pugilism, that was unknown in the days of Robin Hood, 
has now risen to the dignity of a science, with a nomenclature of its own. Hunting has in 
some Bort been neglected, for racing ; though there are still many Nimrods of the manor, who 
urge the chase at full speed for 30 miles. The English are good horsemen, and much of 
their training comes from the chase. The smaller game, such as pheasants, woodcocks, and 
partridges, are now chiefly killed by the sportsmen of England, who have wonderful skill with 
the fowling-piece. There are books printed with blank columns for a sportsman's chronicle, 
in which he notes the number and description of game, when and where killed, &c. Hunt- 
mg is so common in all natipns, that men hardly regard it as a cruel sport. 

But there are many popular sports in England which an English traveler must forget, before 
be can censure the bull fights ot Spain. A bull baiting is little better than a bull fight. The 
animal is in England tied to a ring, and dogs are set upon him. They fasten upon his nostrils, 
and he gores them, or tosses them in the air. In the arenas of Spain, the bull has in some 
sort, fair play, which, even the English proverb admits, is a iewel. He is allowed space for 
action and means of defence, and he sometimes mingles the blood of his persecutors with his 
own. In England he is tied to the rack and tortured. 

Pugilism or boxing is pursued with incredible zeal. A match is announced in the papers 
for weeks before it is held, and the champions are put in a regular course of diet or training. 
At the fight, every sort of vehicle to which horse was ever attached, is put in requisition, and 
on the field these are formed in a circle round the space allotted for the ring, and the specta- 
tors stand upon them. The contest/ are sometimes fatal, and always sanguinary. When the 
flesh of one of the pugilists is beaten to a jelly, he is said to be much '^ punisned " ; a blow 
in the stomach is termed a hit in the ^^bread-basket ; " to draw blood is to ^^ tap claret ; '' 
and a report of a fight relates, that a champion having knocked out one of his antagonist's eyes, 
'^ made continual play at the other." Well may the amateurs of this ^^ science " be called

In London one of the favorite amusements of the wealthy, is the Italian opera^ which jb one 
of the best in Europe. The distinguished performers assume much state, and it is a matter of 
deficate negptiation to engage them, or to reconcile their jealousies when they are engaged. 
To the opera, it is usual to go in a full dress.f The theatres, though often full, are less fre- 
quented than at the other capitals of Europe. There are provincial theatres m all the larger 

fortunate enoogh to obtain a aubscription through aoiiM 
powerful interest, is precluded from bringin^r more than 
one on the same night. A joung unmarried nobleman, 
or single genUeman of fashion and fortune, or. a foreign 
count with a lon^ name and a star, find little diÂ£Sculty in 
winning their favor. Thej have, however, not unfre- 
<^uentljr repented of their extreme partiality to foreigners, 
since a Greek count carried off one of their greatest heir- 
esses, and proved to be a mere adventurer whose Alba- 
nian capote and moustaches d la greCf had given an air 
disti^gul; or since the great Russian prince with his 
ferocious air, and diamond buttons, turned out to be a 
discarded courier, who had made free with his master's 
wardrobe. The assembly-room is a Urge and lofty apart* 
ment, handsomely but plainly fitted up, with no furniture 
to impede the dancing, out tiers of benches covered with 
red stuff, and rising one above the other ; splendid lustree 
of cut crystal, with smaller lamps variously disposed, 
give an equal and brilliant light to the apartment The 
orchestra, which is in a gallery on one side, is occupied 
by Collinet and his celebrated band, unequalled, for the 
beanty of their quadrilles, walties, and masurkas. The 
staircase is well Iijg;hted and covered with scarlet cloth, 
and when the folding* doors are thrown open, the general 
efieet is striking and l>riUiant 

As the society is thus carefully sifted, it consists of all 
that London can produce of fashion and high rank. 
The roval dukes seldom fail to attend. The princesse* 
with their ladies in waiting, frequenUy honor Almaoki 
with tiieir presence. The dress of the ladies is usually 
more splendid than at a private party, and there is a 
greater display of fine jewels than is probably to ' be 
met with in any other assembly of the same description 
in Europe. Diamonds shake on the brows of the anti- 
quated dowagers, or add a new lustre to the sparkling 
eyes of the younger peeresses. The full dress uniforma 
of field-marshals or guardsmen, add variety to the scene, 
and many of the greatest statesmen and ministers, relax 
their minds from tne cares of the morning, by a freouent 
attendance at Almacks. The Duke (^ Wellington seldom 
fails to make his bow to the patronesses, though upon one 
occasion rather hardly treated by their despotic govern* 
ment Their ladyships have made it a rule, that nobody 
should be admitted after eleven. One evening the fiital 
flutes had just closed, when the carriage of the Duke of 
Wellington drove to the door, with a thundering knock 
for admittance. Up flew Willis to make known the dw* 
tressing fact ** Keep him out," said a dowager peeress ; 
" he knows the rules, and must abide by them." Willis 
bowed before the decrees of Fate; but in a few minutea 
returned. *' His grace presents his compliments. He is 
in full dress and the night is cold. The House of Lords 
sat late upon an interesting debate, moreover he is but 5 
minutes jpast his time, and is now standing in the pas- 
sage." The patronesses looked at each other, *'Keep 

him out ; " exclaimed the young ladies M . '* The 

Duke of Wellington has no more right to transgress the 
rule than any one else." << The House of Lords, ladies, *

* The following is a description of a battle between two 
pogifists, in the style that is common in the English pa- 
pers. It is to be remembered, that there is a vast crowd 
akottt the ring which is cleared in this way. Hie ama- 
teurs make a regular onset upon them, and although it is 
taken as a jest, there is no lack of heavy blows. It is for 
a moment a scene of the ffreatest uproar, after which 
every one takes his place. The fight seems not to have 
been one of the most desperate ones, though perhaps it is 
a fair speoimen of a battle by people under tne grade of 
the professors. It was between deaf Davis and a feather- 
bed maker named English. 

Round 1. The deaf-one had hardly put himself into 
attitude when he went to work like a hammer-man and 
floored English like a shot flat upon his back. 

2. The reather-bed hero, before be could look round 
him affain, received three facers in succession and was 
again floored. 

3. English came up Â«imely to the scratch, when Da- 
vis pomshed him in ail directions and put in such a blow 
over one of his peepers that he was positively electrified. 
He put np his arm to feel if he had not lost his head, 
Utnied his back and was stopped only by the ropes. Here 
Davis caught his adversanr and once more leveled him. 
** Tkke him away," rang nom all parti of the ring, <* he 
will be killed." 

4. Contrary to all expectation the <* feather-bed maker '* 
was not soch a flat as he seemed ; he met Davis like a 
tmmp, and after a terrific rally Davis was hit down almost 



5. English put a new fkce, or rather one of another 
odor on Davis ; he milled him from one end of the ring 
to tke other, aiid by a flocmng hit, levelled the deaf-one 
ia his native dust 

e. Davis again took the lead, and nobbed the feathered 
hero to a stand still; when English in turn gave him a 
hit that was almost a finisher, on the knowledge-box. 

7. .This round was fighting ** with a vengeance." The 
efauet run in streams from both their mugs. Davis was 
floored, and on being called, said to his second " he could 
not stand." It was over in 12 minutes. 

t Almacks, the best public assembly in London, is held 
twice a week during the season, in Willis's Rooms, St 
James's street It is under tlie direction of 12 ladies of 
the highest rank and fashion, who are called patronesses. 
These lady patronesses have the privilege of accepting or 
lejeetinff all candidates for admission. They regulate the 
hoars, the music, the refreshments, &o. 

At the approach of the season, and at other times, if 
avfthing urgent demands their attention, they meet in 
solemn eonclave, in the apartments of Mr. WiUis. Seats 
are placed for them round the table, where the debate is 
lo be held. If one of their number has died, or resigned 
her office in consequence of ill health, absence from Lon- 
don, or a disagreement with her associates, the choice of 
asBecessor occasions as much debate, as the election of a 
new pope. Or if an application has been made by any 
Isdy, or gentleman, or family newly arrived in town, for 
nimistiim to their weekly assembly, the condition, con- 
nexions, and fashionable character of the individuals are 
diseussed with a warmth which not unfrequently termi- â€¢ 
nates ia universal dissension. Great is the consternation 
of the ofiieious Mr. Willis, when he perceives these signs 
cf intestine discord. He flies about uneasilyfiftscMn ducl^ss 
wo countess, pokes the fire, makes a pleasant remark upon 
the weather, and hopes that nothing which As has said 
or done has caused offence to their ladyships. A lady 
with a large fkmily of daughters is their aversion ; or if 



said Willis imploringly. *< Let the House of Lords meet 
earlier on an Almacks night," said the Countess of Sâ€”. 
Willis descended with this last replv. Â« So much for the 
discipline ff petticoat government, ' said his grace good- 
humoredhr, as lie drew his military cloak round him, and 
drove oflf. An air of formality is more observable at 
Almacks than at any other party in London. Fashion 
and rank being usually preferred to youth and beaalpr 
there is a greater proportion of antiouated nobility thn 
of the jroung or the gav. Besides whioh| young men of

fhU dreae neoeuaiy for these reunions. Or when they do 
beetow their preaenoe upon the locietj, few of them will 
gjo through with the exertion of performing; Â» set of quad- 
nlles. A few turns in the waltz with a fiishionable married 
beauty, with the wife of a cabinet minister, or the dauf h- 
t9r <n the ptemier, suffices them for the eveninff. The 
fallopade, howeveri has begun to add a little life to the form- 
ality of Almacks. Sixty couples galloping at once round 
the loom, are apt to lose a little of their reserFe in the 
mere absurdity of their employment The refreshments are 
little attended to. Tables with weak green tea and sugar 
biscuits shock the lover of a |rood supper. Many attempts 
have been made to throw this assembly into discredit. 

Former patronesses, who have quarreled with their col- 
Wsfoes in office, have given select parties on the same 
ni^t, in the amiable hope of drawing away the most dis- 
tinguished persons from Willis's. But, as a select public 
mbly, it is still without a rival in the annals of London 

ij

the most feskkviahlt aw Brooke's, White's, Crockford's, 
Boodle's, and the Wyndham. The United Service Club 
tmd the Traveler's are also very celebrated ; for admission 
tt the latter, an individual must have been a travels. 
These dobs are supported by an annual subscription from 
each of the members ; as also by a sum of money paid by 
eaeh member on entering. A club is formed by the aÂ«o- 
oiatlon of a certain num^ of gentlemen, who fix upon a 
house, which they either buy or rent, and choose a master 
to manage it, in whose name the establishment ia carried 
otL They agree upon certain rules which are written 
down, and f^ch every member is bound to observe. By 
this means a single man finds himself enabled to enjoy tM 
benefit of the best and most select society, together with 
every luxury that he can possibly desire, without the ex- 
pense or trouble of maintaining an establishment of his 
own. When any innovation or amendment is about to be 
proposed, a committee of the members is held to deliberate 
np<Mi its expediency. When one of the members proposes 
the introduction A any genUeman, he is balloted for by 
the others. Two black balls are sufficient to exclude him. 
The bkick-balled member may be again proposed for, and 
returned the next year. A good deal of interest is re- 
qnired to obtain admittance into the most fashionaUe 
slnhs. Each member may have a sleeping apartment. 
There are several puUic rooms ; one allotted exclusively 
for smoking, where oigars and cofiee are always in readi- 
ness ; another for billiards. A variety of servants, and a 
first rate French cook, are maintained by the master of the 
establishment. The arrangements of tlie first rate London 
clubs have now arrived at such a beiffht of perfection, that 
young men of fashion not only spend the greatest part of 
their time there, but care little for any other society. 
Newspapers, breakfast, and bUliards, conversation upon 
sport, gayety, or politics ; lounging at the windows, and 
qniszing the passers-by, usuallv fill up their morning 
hours ; and oass away tnose dull moments, during which 
ne votarv or fiuhion can with proprietv be seen out of 
doen. Returning either from his attendance at the House 
or^n a fetigulng ride^ a member has the satiafeetion of 



having dinner at a moment's warning, without the troidile* 
some necessity of dressing or ofpnUmg off his boots. Or 
if he gives a dinner to a ^rty ofhis Aahioiuible firiends,a 
private apartment is provided for him, together with every 
luxury and delicacy that tiondon can afford; the most 
perfect attendance, the best cookery , and the rarest wines. 
Gambling is usually carried to a great extent ; cards and 
dice are brought in ai^r supper, or after a lengthened db- 
ner, which has terminated in a call for supper, and during 
which the bottle has circulated freely Immense sums 
are lost and won at whist and ^carte. The excitement 
and dissipation, the total absence of ceremony mingled with 
refinement, which characterize these assoeiations; com- 
bined, perhaps, with the insipid reserve which is observa* 
ble in the circles of the modem aristocracy, have indueed 
the young men of fashion in some measure to withdraw 
themselves from these more polished reunions, and to pre- 
fer an evening spent at their own club to the beirt eomety 
elsewhere. 

Those sinks of vice and iniquity, known under the ap* 
propriate denomination of HdU, which disgrace tlM neign- 
Dornood of 8t. James's, and other fashionable parts of the 
metropolis, are unfortunately the resort of nearlj half of 
the young men of rank and fortune in London. As tbqr 
are not under the protection of j^vemment. like aimflar 

S ambling establishments in Pans, Milan, &o., a certain 
egree <Â» secrecy is necessary in conducting them. Thi&f 
are usually opened by some needy adventurer, who is as- 
sociated with sharpers and othier notorious characters. 
The society is of the most mixed description ; the peer 
and the blackleg sit familiarly at the same table. Cfaa- 
bling levels all distinctions ; and the proudest and most 
aristocratic nobleman is not ashamed to pass night wRa 
night in the company of the lowest and most infhmous 
characters. No sooner hss a young man of fortone set 
foot in London, than the memters S the Hells fix their 
eye upon him as a fit subject for fleecing, and unless he 
has sufficient good sense to be warned by the experience 
of others, it is seldom that he can avoid the snare. But a 
gambler who has lost his fortune, too ofien has a pleasure 
m reducing all others to the same condition. A young 
man is inouced to visit these gaming-houses firooi curios- 
ity and a love of novelty. He plays at first with caution, 
and it is seldom that the company do not contrive that he 
shall win for the firet few nights. Excitement soon f(^ 
lows ; loss after loss at length renders him desperate ; and 
he soon finds himself upon a level with those whose very 
names he would have scorned to pronounce but a fbw 
months before. The light of the sun is excluded from 
these asylums. The shutters ars closed, and night sue- 
ceeds day, and day follows night, and yet the gambleri 
continue in fierce and desperate eontest Hazard nmd 
icKtii are the principal games. The lights, cards, and 
dice are supplied by the master of the establiBbment, with a 
casual refreshment to those who find it necessary. If the 
voung man who has been inveigled into these haunts can 
by an efifort of courage shake himself free before it is too 
late, the expailence he has gained majr be of service to 
him ; otherwise he is plunged into irretrievable ruiui both 
of fortune and principles.

18 Ediuation. Id late years, the greatest exertions have been made to spread knowledge 
mong the common people, though the laboring classes are less intelligent than the same grade 
in Scotland or New England. Various series of cheap and admirable books for ifae instruction 
of the commoa people have been much spread, and some of them are now republished in the 
United States. There is also a great circulation of newspapers, and although few people in 
England take them, compared with the uumbers that do so in tbis country, yet a paper passes 
tbroi^b so rosoy hands, that a great deal of intelligence is thus circulated. In the towns and 
Tillages there are reading clubs and circulating libraries. 

About half of the children in England are educated at free schools. It is, however, those 
wbo are engaged in the manufactories who reap the least advantage from schools ; yet, after 
the hours of labor are over, which make from naif to two-thirds of the twenty-four, half an hour 
or an hour is devoted to instruction. The higher English schoob have practically a republican 
tendency. The boys are sent to them young, and at a distance from home. Their consider- 
auoo among their mates depends upon the manner in which they treat them, for there is little 
d>ifereDce paid to wealth or rank. Each one is thrown on his own resources, and thir ac- 
/fuires a greater stability of purpose and civility of demeanor. The system of fagging is not 
indeed a republican one, but it is so far one of equality, that every fag has in time hie own fag, 
as every dog is said to have his day.* The boys at school sometimes resist the lawful author- 
ties, and rise in the rebellion of a " barring out." They rail up and barricade the doors and 
windows, collect such provisions as in haste they may, and often sustain a siege of several 
days so well, that they are admitted to honorable conditions of surrender. If, however, they 
are taken by storm, they have little to expect, but a thorough execution of the laws of the 
schools, which are do less severe than the articles of war. The English favor severe pun- 
ishnients in all things, and the practice of flogging is universal in the schools. Wealth and rank 
claim no exemption, and a boy under the 6th form at Eton is liable lo this degrading punishment.

The revenues of the English UDirenittes are immense ; Oxford and Cambridge ** tboi^ 
twin stars of learning" are princely esublishments. The fellowsbips, are >ome of tbem of 
ample income, and almost all of them insure a comfortable eubsieience. It is possible, too, 
as in New England, for a poor scholar to enjoy the advantages of the Universities by perform* 
ing certain menial services, and some of the greatest names in Englantl were servitors jd the 
Universities. The ancient discipltne is somewhat relaxed, and though there are many excel- 
lent scholars, some youths there are who go to Oxford and Cambridge, only because it is die 
custom to go, and who carry away as little knowledge as they bring. There are ia>aU partt 
of England, a great many private schools, under the directloD of emiuent scholars, but 
feiver of the endowed public schools like those in the United Slates called academies. 
Some of ibe most profound of the English scholars have kept these private schools ; and the 
advantage could not be slight, to a zealous student, of having the instruction of such men as 
Johnson and Parr. 

19. State of the ,3rt$. The aru, in England, have received their greatest impulse and 
advancement, within the last half century. There has, indeed, always been a sufficient degree 
of taste to lead to the purchase of foreign or ancient collections, but there was not sufficient 
encouragement to the artists at home. The Royal Academy has done much to improve ibe 
taste in the arts, and to encourage the professors. Excellence now meets with muoificeDi 
reward, greater perhaps than in any other country, and artists of great merit have sprung up 
in all branches, and some of them of great originality. 

There are a great many colleciions of paintings by tbe old masters, and many modem and 
antique sculptures. Greece has been plundered of 
what time and barbarians had spared, and the sculp- 
tures of tbe ParlheoOD have been traosported lo 
London. An English artist can find much to assist, 
in forming bis taste in England, and Sir Thomas 
Lawrence did not see the monuments of his art in 
Italy till past the meridian of life. Sculpture bai 
been as much advanced as painting, by Flaxnun, 
Chantrey, lind others ; and (he features of the greii 
and good of England will be fmthfuUy transmitted 
in marble, to posterity. 

The English have a passion for music, if tbeii 
fondness of tbe Opera be a test ; and all musical 

Serformers of excellence receive splendid rewards, 
iut it is in tbe useful arts that tbe English are most 
Tit Gamut Vote. distinguished ; wherever commerce has frei^ted 

a ship, in the remotest corners of the earth, are 
to be found the products of English ingenuity. The cutlery, the porcelain, and the thousand 
articles of luxury and show, have been brought to such perfection, that all improvement seenu 
impossible. 

The sciences are much indebted to England, and the natural sciences are nowhere so suc- 
cessfully cultivated, except perhaps at Paris. Bacon seems to have diverted the inquiries of 
the English philosophers to these, though the philosophy of the mind has not of late been 
neglected. There are at present many luminaries in England, in the sciences of chemistry, 
geology, and anatomy. The government has despatched several expeditions, to penetrate to 
the Pacific Ocean, around the northern part of America, and though without success, still 
much has been 'gained to science. Other expeditions have greatly increased the stores of 
geographical knowledge, within a few years. 

In no former age, has the press been so prolific, or literature so much spread and rewarded. 
The public is now the munificent patron, that discovers and rewards excellence, and it is no 
strange sight, though it was never seen in the days of Goldsmith and Fielding, toseeaa 
author made rich by the labors of his pen. The profusion of new books is, upon tbe whole, 
more remarkable than their excellence ; and, though there are many authors of thr present 
day, with whom posterity will he familiar, the great mass, like those of every age, will be 
â–¡either read nor remembered. The greatest change that a few years have made in English 
literature has been effected by a form of writing unknown lo the ancients, that is, the novel

kaowledge of human nature. 

20. ReKgunij &c. The earliest rekgion in Britain of which any account has reached us, 
was that of the Druids ; a gloomy and sanguinary superstition. It included a belief in trans- 
migracion, and enjoined human sacrifices. The temples were the deep recesses of a grove, 
or a circle of upright stones, for the Druids held it unlawful to worship the Deity under any 
roof raised by human hands. TertulUan, who died A. D. 302, was the first who asserted the 
existence of Christianity in England. But the irruption of the pagan Saxons suppressed it till 
570, when it was renewed and extended, in consequence of the marriage of one of the mon- 
archi with a princess of France. 

The Protestant religion is now established by law, and the king is the head of the church. 
There are 2 archbishops, and 24 bishops, all of whom, except the Bishop of Sodor and 
Man, are peers of the realm, and have seats in the House of Lords. The archbishop of 
CttDterbun^ is called the Primate of all England, and his rank is that next below the royal 
family. The archbishop of York is called the Primate of England. The bishops have some 
temporal authority, and the ecclesiastical jurisdiction extends to all questions of births, marÂ« 
riages, deaths, probate of wills, and delinquencies of the inferior clergy. Under the bishops, 
are the deans prebendaries, archdeacons, rectors, priests, curates, and deacons. The church 
wardens overlook the alms for the poor. A plurality of benefices is not uncommon, though 
the incumbent can perform only the duties of one ; and a slight excuse sometimes serves for 
a n^Iect of even these. The wealth and patronage of the church is immense. For a further 
view of this topic, the reader is referred to the article on Religion, under the head of Great 
Britain. In a wealthy parish, there are lectureships, or preaching, after the ordinary service, 
and the expense is defrayed by contribution. A clergyman has sometimes a chapel of his 
own, conveniently fitted up with stoves and easy seats, and, if a popular preacher, he lets out 
the pews to great advantage. The clergy of the established church are a learned and pious 
body, though there are many individuals in it, who have neither learning nor piety. Where 
the right of presentation to a church is held by a layman, he will too often be moved by con- 
siderations of friendship or afi[inity, more than by a desire to preserve the purity of the church. 
Hence there are so many sporting parsons in the country, and m London so many clergymen 
to be seen at theatres and blalls. 

The Dissenters are a numerous body, and have many ministers of great learning and purity

nomerous, and have several colleges and convents. A description of all the different creeds

land has bad a share of those enthusiasts, who first delude themselves and then lead others 
astray. Within the present centunr a madman named Richard Brothers, who had been a 
lieotenant in the navy, called himself the king of the Hebrews, and found many to believe in his 
title. He called the earth hell, and be taught that all men were created j and that they fell 
with Adam, but had since transmigrated into different bodies. A first-rate engraver became 
a convert to this doctrine, and engraved the head of Brothers ; a member of Parliament, who 
was a profound oriental scholar, was another believer. London, however, would not come 
over to the faith, and Brothers threatened it with an earthquake and foretold the day ; but the 
city stood firm, and he pretended that he had saved it by prayer. Numbers, however, were 
abamed, and it was said, that some looked for the general conflagration. It was said, too, 
that fire insurance advanced, and that some merchants made preparations for additional fire- 
engui, with directions for the firemen to ^' keep a sharp look out on the Bank of England." 
Brtibe case was bad enoi^h without ridicule, and the government caused Brothers to be 
confined as a lunatic.

from the primate. Thcro is a superstition, that Friday is unlucky, and there are few marriiget 
on that day. Tbe number of marriages is about 96,030 yearly, and 1 in 20 have no issue. 
Tbe married women outlive the single. In the country, the average number of children to 
a marriage is 4 ; in the cities, h is 7 to 2 marriages. Every sect bury the dead after their ova 
manner, and there is some pomp and parade, especially in processions at funerals. The deid 
are deposited in tbe vaults of a church, or buried in tbe churchyard ; all are dressed in woolen. 
Gray's elegy is the best possible description of a country churchyard. The yearly number of 
deaths is 333,708, or 25,592 monthly, 6,398 weekly, 914 daily, and 40 hourly. One half die 
before the age of 17, and 1 in 3,136 attains to 100 years.

22. Laws The laws of England are divided into the statute law, or the enactments of the 
legisktore, and the common law, which is the most ancient, and which has gradually grown up 
from the exigencies of society. The common law derives its authority from immemorial usage, 
and the origin of it is lost in remote antiquity, though some of it may have come from acts 
of Parliament, that have not been transmitted to us. This law lies in precedents and the de- 
cisions of courts ; the evidences of it are in the records of courts, the reports of cases decided, 
and the treatises of learned and ancient sages. This venerable law constitutes the basis of the 
jurisprudence of all the United States, except Louisiana, where there is a code. 

The great monuments of English law and bulwarks of justice, are the writ of ^^ Habeas Cor- 
pus " and the trial by jury. This writ, as it now stands, was granted in the 31st year of Charles 
the Second, and it has been adopted m substance in all the United States ; where, as in Eng- 
land, it may be suspended in emergencies, requiring the executive to have great powers, as in 
rebellion or invasion. Any person, restrained of his liberty, even by command of the king, 
shall, upon the demand of his counsel, have a writ of Habeas .Corpus to bring his body before 
the Court of Kmg's Bench or of the Common Pleas ; which shall, within three court days, 
determine whether the cause of commitment be just. No subject can, therefore, be kept long 
b prison without legal cause. 

The trial by jury is of Saxon origin, and, in England, the jury is composed of 12 persons, 
who are required to be unanimous. In Scotland, the number is 15, and a majorj^ is taken 
instead of tmaniroity. 

The judge the English people by their laws, previous to some recent changes, wc might call 
ihera a savage people. The capital offences were lately about 200. In the reign of George 
theTbh-d, 17 capital punishments Imd been made by one act, and by the marriage act, 5 capital 
feloniee are created in one line. Well may it be said that a mere word slayeth.* The great-

but it goes so far as to make it death to lift anything off a

est crime known to the laws is Treason, but under this head is included, besides the ofieoce 
towards the king's life, that of slayjng his chancellor, or judge, in the execution of their offices 
and that of counterfeiting the king's coin, or of bringing false money into the realm. Tbe 
penalty for treason,was,that the offender be drawn to the gallows, on the ground or pavement, 
that he be hanged by the neck, and then cut down alive, that his entrails be taken out, and burned 
while he is yet alive, that his head be cut off, that his body be divided into four parts, and dot 
his head and quarters be at the king's disposal. But all this is lately done away. 

In the Tower burying-ground, it may puzzle some future antiquary to discover so many buried 
trunks wanting the heads ; for executions for treason have generally taken place near the Tower. 
It is petty treason for a servant to slay his master, or a wife her husband, and instead of a cart, 
as in other capital offences, the criminal is drawn on a hurdle. The bodies of robbers are 
often hung in chains, till they fall to pieces. For adultery, there is no penalty in the criminal 
code ; but for ^^ Grand Larceny," or the taking goods from another above the value of twehe 
pence, the pinishment is death. Death is, indeed, much honored in the English code. It is 
punished with death to steal an heiress, to forge deeds, notes, &c., for a bankrupt to refuse to 
surrender his effects, to pick pockets of above the value of one shilling, to steal bonds or bank 
notes, to steal above 40 shillings on a river, to steal or destroy linen in bleaching grounds, to 
lay in wait and disfigure or maim any person, to maim or kill any cattle maliciously, to break 
down the head of a fish pond, whereby fish may be lost, to cut down trees in an avenue or gar- 
den, to cut hop binds, to return from transportation, to conceal the death of an illegitimate child, 
to steal from a ship in distress, to stand mute, or to challenge above twenty jurors in capital 
felonies, to commit perjury under the insolvent acts, to personate bail, or acknowledge fines or 
judgments in another's name, and to send threatening letters. [See Supplement.] 

The following enactments are some of them similar to the statutes in IVew England. Rogues 
and vagabonds are to be committed to prison, and among these are ranked persons going about 
soliciting alms, under pretences of loss by fire, fencers, bearwards, stroUing players, minstrels, 
except those licensed by Lord Duiton in Cheshire, gypsies, fortune-tellers, persons threaten- 
ing to run away and leave their wives and children on the parish, and persons wandering abroad, 
lodging in ale houses, out houses, or the open air, and not giving a good account of themselva. 
For many offences, the penalty is transportation to distant colonies. 

The game laws are a peculiar trait in English jurisprudence. They are the relics of a darker 
age than the present, though the present age has by no means relaxed their severity. The os- 
tensible reason is the preservation of game, but an incidental one may be the disarming of the 
great body of the people, as it is unlawful for one not qualified to kill game, or keep a gun, and 
his house may be searched, on suspicion. Any person is qualified to kill game, who bas a 
freehold of Â£ 100 a year, or a church benefice of Â£ 150. The sons of esquires, and of persons 
of higher degree, have the same privilege, and a privileged person may take another with bim 
who is not qualified. Often, therefore, a man cannot kill the partridge that lives upon his own 
estate, though a stranger may enter his enclosures and do this without trespass. The richest 
merchant or manufacturer in the kingdom, may also be unqualified to kill game. The penalty 
for selling game is severe, yet nothing is more openly or extensively sold, and poaching is a 
regular and a profitable trade. It has been proved, too, that the very ^^ Nimrods of the manor " 
sell their came in defiance of honor and law. Several of the severest penalties are imposed 
by what is not miscalled the Black Act. The Bankrupt laws form a considerable code, and 
they afford relief to the tradesman who has conducted a fair, though not a thriving trade. 
Some similar system seems to be necessary in every commercial country. 

There is much legislation under the head of poor laws, for the relief of that great body of 
people who cannot support themselves, and who require parish aid. The tax raised for

this p irpose is not far from 8 miliion pounds, aod about 1 ,200,000 people, io a popiilÂ«ti<Â»i 
of II millions, receive ass^^ance from it, though it is by do means shared by all who are 
miserably poor. Some accounts make the poor one third of the whole. Southey says, 
'^ There is no liberty for the poor in England ; they are no longer sold with the soil, it is true, 
but they cannot quit the soil, if there is any probability that age or infirmity will disable them. 
If they remove from a crowded parish, to find a more profitable residence elsewhere, the par- 
ish to which they go may often send them back, to avoid the remote liability of burying them. 
Sometimes thev die upon the road. The overseers are not men chosen to the office, because 
they show the mdications of benevolence, nor is it common to see parish aid ofilered in such a 
manner, that the favor is increased by the manner of bestowing it. Great are the miseries of 
the poor, and hardly one third of their offspring is reared. A life of labor is closed in the 
almshouse, among rogues and lunatics. To this," says Southey, ^^ the poor look as*their last 
resting-place on this side of the grave." 

The execution of the laws in England being much milder than the spirit of them, the good 
sense of the community is in advance of the humanity of the laws. Two persons, who at- 
tempted the life of the king, after a fair trial, were confined as lunatics. Notwithstanding the 
penalty of treason, no traitors are dismembered till after they are dead. Some offences are 
visited, besides other penalties, with attainder and corruption of blood ; so that the estate is 
forfeited, and the children incapable of inheriting. The law of primogeiiiture, by which the 
eldest inherits the estate, is a necessary part of the system of aristocracy, and it keeps togeth- 
er, for ages, the immense territorial possessions of the nobility and others. The law is still 
in force, that inflicts the punishment of ducking on scolds, though it is never enforced. In 
China, this offence is a sufficient reason for divorce. In fact, there is but too much resem- 
blance in spirit, if not in letter, between parts of the English law and the code of China. In 
England, a monarch would be at once deposed, who should inflict, arbitrarily and wantonly, a 
tenth part of the cruelty prescribed by the laws. 

The elections in England may be said to be pure, that is, the voters are overawed by no 
force, or threats ; but there is another species of influence, to which they are peculiarly liable 
in a coantry where both wealth and poveny are in extremes. Thb is bribery ; and though 
there are heavy penalties against it, as well as against entertainments, it is practised with scarce 
a shadow of concealment. In some places, where the votes are few, the price of one is Â£ 50. 
No stranger can see an election in England, with a favorable opinion of a voter's estimate of 
the elective franchise. The elections are sometimes continued for weeks, and are scenes of 
riot, and drunkenness. The candidates, like Coriolanus, have to interfere and advance their 
own election, when they are found at the polls, adapting themselves to the popular humor, and 
haranguing the electors. There can hardly be too severe a description of an English election. 

23. iSnHquUies. The antiquities of England are chiefly architectural, and those that are 
referred to the Druids are such as men would erect in the infancy of art, though they imply 
the power of moving large masses. The most simple of the druidical monuments are single 
upright stones, together with cairns or heaps of stones, some of which contain 100 cart loads. 
The cromlechs are huge flat stones, laid upon supporters like a table ; and the rocking stones, 
which may have been somewhat indebted to art for their facility of motion, were probably 
used in the rites of the Druids, as near many of them basins or baths are dug in the rock. 
Near Penzance there is a rocking stone, called Logan Rock', of 320 tons, so poised that a 
man may move it like a cradle by applying his shoulder, and this could formerly be done 
with the force of one hand ; it moves only in one direction. But the great monuments are 
the circles of stones, of which there are many ; one at Abury, in Wiltshire, had 652 stones. 
Stonehenge, however, on Salisbury plain, is the most frequently visited. The whole is 
inclosed by a broad ditch, forming an exact circle. The structure was composed of different 
eircles, or rather of 2 circles and 2 ovals, all concentric. The outward range of columns 
(bimed a circle, 310 feet in circumference, and consisted of 30 upright stones, 4 feet apart ; 
each of these was about 17 feet above the ground, 6 feet in width, and 3 feet in thickness. 
These pillars had horizontal stones laid on their top, and were connected as in a ring or fence. 
They were secured by mortices and tenons, and their whole height was 30 feet. Of this 
outward circle, there are now standing 14 perpendicular stones, with 6 horizontal ones ; 11 
of the 14 are contiguous, and 5 of the 6. The next circle is 9 feet within the last ; the 
flooes are much smaller, being but 6 feet high, and 1 foot in thickness. They had no hori- 
loolal caps ; only 8 or 10 of these now remain. The next inner range was an ellipse, in 



wfcich !he stones were sfranged id iÂ»irs j each ptir joined by a borJBMital *ido ibove, miA 
raftklag a complete gaieway. The height, including the whole, Â»Â» 26 feel. There were 5 
of these galeways. Within these, wm another range of 19 upright stones, tapering like obe- 



Jhaait Druid TtmpU of SUmdtenge remvtd 

lisks ; 6 of these are now standing. At one end of this innermost range, are the fragmeDti of 
a huge stone, 16 feet long, 4 feet broad, and 30 inches in thicknesa. Stonehenge is indeed 
but a rude mosunieDt, but it is impossible to survey it without some of the awe which arises 
from beholding more classic temples. Near the main atmctuTB of Stoneheoge, are several 
detached columns, that form no part of the original structure. In the structure, the largest 
stones are of the weight of 30 or 40 tons, and there is no quarry of similar stone within several 
miles. The vicinity is covered with great numbers of barrows or mounds of eanh. 

There are a few rude Danish monuments extant, but the vestiges of the Romans are nearly 
obliterated in England. There is the line of the wall, called the wall of Severus, running 68 
miles from the Tyne to the Solway Frith. It vras built A. D. 209. The facing stones have 
long been removed, and the plough has passed over many of their places. We know the 
description of tbe wall chiefly from Bede, who lived while some part of it was in good 
preservation. 

In (he city of Chester, as well as in various parts of England, are other remains. The 
parapet here is supposed to have been originally a Roman work. There are also the remaitis 
of a Roman baih, of which the roof is covered with cement ; and an altar has been found with 
this inscription : J^gmphu et Fontibus Leg. XX. V. V. The old part of Chester, is an anti- 
quity of itseir. The houses are of every material, and many of them ere neariy falling with 
age. The streets are in the second etory of the houses, and the ground floor is open to the 
public ; a sort of covered gallery, said to be devised for better defence in the incursions of 
the Welch. The remains of the Saxons are not numerous, hut they indicate strength in the 
ntanner of building ; but England is rich in the gothic edifices, the style of which was intro- 
duced by the Normans. Had the castles been still as needful as in those unquiet times, before 
every man's house was his castle, or had the monastic rule continued till now, there would 
have been hardly a ruined abbey or castle in England. A little repair will check the com- 
mencement of decay, which, if not checked speedily, becomes dilapidation. The caibedialj, 
used as metropolitan churches, are in excellent preservation, though they are kept so at con- 
siderable expense. Many of the castles sufered in the civil war, when they were used u 
forts, and assailed by cannon. Some of them are as old as tbe conquest, and othns were 
erected several centuries after. They are of all fonns and magnitudes, and generally in plscei

The abbeys, escept In cities, have suffered no less than fhe castles. Many of them were 
nugnificent in the extreme, and the very ruins strike the beholder with admiration. These 
ire numerous, and generally placed in situations of great fertility and beauty. Tiutern Abbey, 
on the river Wye, is, like many other ruins, overgrown with ivy. The roof is gone, and 
wiibin, the edifice is seen to great advantage. The walls, pillars, and abutments are perfect. 
The grass is cropped within, and every loose stone is removed. It is as if Westminster 
Abbey were unroofed. There are many other abbeys, whose ruins are much visited and 
(dmired. The cathedrals are noble structures. The cathedral at Canterhnry is a rich gotbic 
building, 514 feet long, and 74 broad. One of the towers is 235 feet in height. The spire 
of the Salisbury cathedral is 410 feet in height. York cathedral, called by the citizens the 
Minster, was built in the time of Edward the First, and is an elegant and magnificent structure, 
not eacumbered with buttresses without. The length is 5&o feel, and the greatest breadth it 
232 feet. It is 235 feel in height, and the largest window is 75 feet by 32. There is nothing 
tbit so much attracts the admiration of Americans in England as the cathedrals. There ii 
nothing like tbem in hi3Y>wn country, and few edifices are more imposing in Europe. *' Did 
man make it ? " was but a natural thought of the Esquimaux at the sight of St. Paul's.

then invaded and conquered by the Saxons, who parceled out the territory into several dis-

With the outward forms of a monarchy, the government of England has been, to'most prac 
tical purposes, an aristocracy or oligarchy, not greaily diferent from ihst of the repubhc of 
Venice. While the king possessed the right, nominally, to make war and peace, and appoint 
his ministers, be was completely under the control of the House of Commons, who, by grant- 
ing or withholding the supplies of money, that great instrument of power, were enabled to bend 
bioQ to their will. On the other band, while the Commons prd^osed to represent the body of 
the people, the election of a large portion of their number fell into the hands of a few individ 
oals, and that body lost tbe character of a popular assembly. A more equal representaiioD of 
the people has lately been mtroduced ; but tbe right of suSerage is still confined within narrow 
fimits. 

CHAPTER IV. SCOTLAND 

PHTSICAL GEOGRAPHY. 
I. Bowidarita and Extent. Scotland is everywhere surroundei] by the ocean except m iDe 
wutbeast, where it is joined to England. It ts 280 miles in length from north to south, and 
130 miles is its greatest width ; but the coast is extremely irregular and indented by large arms 
of the sea. It contains 30,S0O square miles. It lies between 54Â° ST* and 5SÂ° 36' N. latitude, 
and 1'^ 40' and 6*^ 10' W. longitude. In shape, it has been fancifully compared to a hump- 
tacked old woman, silting upon the ground. 
S. Mountains. Scotland is in part mountainous, and in part billy. The mountuns are 
scattered over tbe surface, without nmningin uniform 
rbains. They are generally from 2 to 4,000 feet 
in height, and a few peaks exCeed 4,000. Tbe 
Grampians are the most southern group. In the 
north are the Highlands of CailhntsB and /ntiertxH, 
and here is Ben JV*eÂ«u, the highest mountain in 
Great Britain, 4,370 feet above the level of the 
sea, and capped with perpetual snow. On one 
side, it exhibits a precipice 1,500 feet perpendicu- 
lar, and the prospect from its summit is indescri- 
bably grand and magnificent. The Penlland Hilh, 
in tbe south, are very picturesque, but not lofty. 
Most of tbe mountainous parts abound with craggy 
rocks, deep, narrow dells, and tumbling torrents ; 
and iheir ruggedness and sterility must ever defy 
Jcatol JlfanjtfFi '''* Utmost efforts of human industry to render 

ihei" nroduciive 



139 SCOTLAND 

S. Biotrt. The rivers are Dumerous, and, descending from s high region, their currents ara 
broken aad rapid, ^hey are of little use in navigation. The Forth runs easterly into ibe 
German ocean, and - at its mouth expands into a wide haj or Frith. It is a very croolied 
atream, and through all its windings has a length of 200 miles ; part of it is navigable for small 
Teasels. The Toy has the largest body of water, with a shorter ^course. It flows in ibe same 
direction, and has a navigation near the sea for ships ; it particularly abounds in salmon. Tbe 
Clyde flows to the sea on the opposite side. It is much broken hy falU, but its mouth admits 
vessels of 400 tons. The Tteetd is a beautiful stream, running into the Gmman ocean near 
tbe English border. It flows 60 miles in a straight line, aad abounds in trout and salmon. 

4. Laku. These are called Lockt in Scotland. The roost remarkable is Loch Loaond, 
near tbe sea in the southwest- It is 30 miles long, of an irregular breadth, but generally nar- 
low. It is sprinkled with islands, some of them large and finely wooded ; the shores are 
everywhere highly beautiful and picturesque. The mountain of Ben Lomond, which over- 
looks the northeastern part, presents a prospect of unequalled grandeur. Loch Katrint io the 
ume neighborhood, is another beautiful sheet of water. LoehLeven, in Fife, is about I2milet 
ID circuit, and contains several small islands, upon one of which Mary, Queen of Scots, vai 
confined by her nobles. In Ayrshire, is Locti Doon, 7 miles in length, the waters of which 
dow into the sea by a river of tbe same name. The banks, of both river and lake, are 
much admired for (heir beautiful scenery, 
and have obtained celebrity from the muse of 
Burnsj who was born here. There are many 
other charming lakes in different parts of the 
country. 

5. Islands. The Htbrida or Wuttn 

blandg lie on the western coast of Scotland. 

They are about 300 in number. The largest ii 

Ltait, 87 miles long. The next in size are, 

Skyt, Mull, and Islay, tSrran, Sovtk Visl, and 

Jura. Most of them are small. They are 

rocky and barren, wiib hardly a single tree or 

even a bush upon them . On the shores are some 

â– wampy tracts and peat bogs. The vegetation 

consists principally of heath and moss. But the 

Bunu'* Ifmut. most remarkable feature of these islands is the 

greatnumber of lakes which they contain ; these, 

However, rather impart gloom than beauty to the landscape ; their sullen brown waters present 

tbe idea of unfathoniabie depth, and their borders exhibit no cheerful verdure to relieve the 

eye. Tbe most westerly of the Hebrides is St. KUda. It is small and rocky, yet inhabited. 

lis shores are composed of enormous precipices, worn Ire the sea into caverns, often with 

roofs more lofty than tbe ceiling of a gothic cathedral. These shores are the resort of vast 

varieties of sea-fowl, which the islanders pursue at immense hazards, by swinging with ropes 

from the perpendicular clifTs. There are 
87 of these islands inhabited, and several 
under good culii ration, producing tolerable 
crops of grain, pulse, and potatoes. The 
inhabitants are about 70,000. Their only 
articles of trade are horned caille, sheep, 
fish, and kelp. One of the smallest of diese 
islands, called Staffa, is remarkable for a 
singular basaltic cavern, called FingaTi 
Cave, S27 feet in length and 43 wide. The 
entrance resembles a gothic arch, and 
the floor of the cave is covered with water. 
The walls of the interior are formed of 
ranges of basaltic columns, irregularly 
_ J. â€ž.â€ž grouped. This natural architecture ii 

i(awfcvfta""/&Â«j,. â€žid ,oBâ€žpasa in grandeur and magnifi- 

cence the most splendid artificial temples and palaces in the woHd. Many of tbe columnar 
-ocks in this island are bent and twisted in a remarkable manner. 



SCOTLAND 18S 

At the noribeni extremit; of Scotland, lie tb* 
Orkneys, or Orcadti, about 70 in Dumber, but lest 
than half of them are inhabited. Tbey are rock; 
and have a melancholy appearance, with little vege- 
tation besides juniper, wild myrtle, and heath. 
The soil is hoggy or gravelly ; some of the islands 
conuin iron and lead. -The sea in this neighbor- 
hood is very tempestuous. In June and July, the 
twilight, which continues through the night, is suffi- 
ciently strong 10 enable the inhabitants to read at 
midnight. The population |s about 30,000. They 
j. -.^j have some manufactures of linen and woolen, and 

have a trade in cattle, fish, oil, and feathers. Vavt 
aumbers of sea-fowl frequent toe rocky cUfis of these islands, and one of the chief employ- 
nents of the inhabitants is bird-catching. 

The Shetland hlandi lie about 60 miles 
northe.a3t of the Orkneys. They have a wild 
and desolate appearance ; but 17 of them ire 
inhabited. Tneir vegetation is more scanty 
than that of the Orkneys, and their soil, for 
the most part, is marshy. The shores are 
broken and precipitous, and excavated by the 
sea into natural arches and deep, caverns. 
From October to April, perpetual rains fall, 
storms beat gainst the shores, and the inhab- 
itants are cut off from all communication with 
the rest of thegvorld ; hut the aurora borealis 
exhibits, at this season, a brightness equal to 
that of the full moon. The population is about 
BMcwcUuÂ«aÂ«sutUÂ»i/<fu. 28,000; (be jpeople live by fishing, and the 

manufacture of coarse woolens. 

6. Bays, Slraitt, and Harbors, The coast is everywhere rocky, and indented by inleti 
iod arms of the sea. The Firth of Forth extends a considerable distance inland, and affords 
good anchorage and shelter in every part. The Firth of Toy is much narrower. Towards 
the north, are tbe Firths of Murray and Domock, the former of which is GO miles in length ; 
llw Utter is the Porlv* Salnlis, or safe haven of the ancient geographora. All these nortbem 
^lores are cold and dangerous, with formidable and rocky headlands. A narrow and tempes- 
tuous sea, at the nortbern extremity, called the Pentland Firth, divides the Orkneys from the 
main land. Proceeding south, along the western coast, deep inlets and rocky islands occur at 
every step. In the south, is the Firth of Solway, a wide bay, forming part of the boundary 
between Scotland and England, in which the tide rises with astonishing rapidity. 

7. Climate. The distinguishing feature in ihp climate, is the excess of moisture. F<^ 
nd drizzling rains prevail in most parts for the greater portion of the year. Considerable 
mows fall in winter, but are soon melted ; sleighs or sledges are never used, but the walera are 
sometimes so frozen, as to permit skating. 

8. Soil. In many of tbe valleys or stralks, there are tracts which are productive, but tbe 
soil is much inferior to that of England. A great part of the country may he considered as 
ibiolately barren. The mountains are naked, and trees of native growth are scarce in every 

9. Geology, Scotland not being separated from England by any great natural boundary or 
intervening sea, the geology of tbe adjacent districts in each is nearly the same ; but, if we 
take a general survey of the whole country, we shall find the great features of the geology of 
Scotland very dilTerent from those of England. If a line be drawn in a northeast direction^ 
Inm the mouih of the Clyde to Stonehaven, on the eastern coast, nearly the whole of Scot- 
lauj, south of that line, is composed of transition rocks, covered in many parts by coal-meas- 
ures, irops, or red sandstone. On the north of this line, nearly the whole country is compos- 
ed of primary rocks of granite, gneiss, and mica slate, covered, at (he feet of the mountain 
ebttns, with beds of conglomerate and red sandstone. Tbe upper secondary stralSj so abuo-

duit in Eaglaiid, scarcelf appears m ScoUaod. The genenl beariDg of tlie different moanttu 
raogea, is tFom oortheasi to southwest. 

10. MineraU, Quarruf, &c. Lead, iron, aod coal, are the most abundant minerals. Tbe 
lead mines are in the southern parts. Coal is reir plentiful, and it is supposed the largest luh 
touched bed of coal in Europe, is in the south of Scotland. Antimony and copper, in snuQ 
quantities, also occur. Cobalt is now afforded by a mine which formerly yielded silver. 

11. fhetoftk* Country. Two thirds of tbe country are mountainous. It is generally coq- 
â– idered as divided into two parts ; the mountainous region, called the Highlands, in the norlli- 
era and central part ; and the comparatively level country in the south, called the Lowlands. 
In tbe north, tbe mountains present noibing to view, but heath and rock, with innumerable iakei 
and pools, darkened by tbe shade thrown Jrom enormous precipices ; the whole forming fdaud- 
â– cape wild and desolate beyond conception. In the central parts, the aspect of the mo^taint 
ia less forbidding. Id tbe south, is every kind of rural variety, hills, vales, and cultivated plains. 

FOLrrlCAL GEOGRAPHT. 
1. Diviriotu. Scotland is divided into S3 counties* or shires. These are subdivided into 
984 parishes. 

3. CandU. The Cakdonian Canal extends from Inverness to Fort William, uniting the 
Moray Firtb with the Atlantic. Its length is 59 miles, including several lakes, through wbicb 
it ppases ; the artiliciBl navigation is 32 miles. This canal is 100 feet wide at the surface, 60 
feet at the bottom, and 20 feet deep, being passable by 32 gun frigates. At one place, is aa 
ascent of 94 feet by 13 locks, end a descent of 90 feet by 13, callea Neptune's staircase. 
This canal cost nearly a million sterling. The receipts afforded by it, do not pay for keepii^ 
it in lepdr. Since its constmction, upwards of a million of forest trees have beeo pbnted 
along iu borders. The forlhand Clyde Canal unites the river Carron, running into the Forth, 
with tbe Clyde, at Glasgow. It is 35 miles long, and has 39 locks. Its width, at the surface, 
is 66 feet, and its depth 8 feet. It has IS aqueducts over roads, streaqis, 8tc. This csiuil 
was begun in 1777, and Giiished in 1790, at an expense of above Â£200,000 sterling. Tbe 
Union Canal is a branch of tfais work, extending to Port Hopeton, near Edinbui^h. The 
MoMand Canal extends from tbe Forth and Clyde canal to Monkland, and is used for the 
transportation of coal and limestone to Glasgow. The Crinan Canal crosses tbe peninsula of 
Kintyre. Tbe tSndrottan Canal, from that place to Glasgow, is not yet completed. 

3. Ctlt(s and Tovm. Edinbwgh, Uie capital of Scotland, stands upon the southern shore 
of the Firth of Forth, a mile and a half from the sea. Its situation is remarkably picturesque. 
It occupies three high ridges of land, and is surrounded on all sides, except the north, by na- 
ked, cre^7 rocks. The middle.ridge is tbe highest, and on either side is a deep ravine. Tbe 

more ancient part of the city occupies the 
two souihern ridges. High street runs 
along the middle eminence, In nearly i 
straight direction, for about a mile, and 
exhibits a very grand prospect. With tbe 
exception of the principal avenues, the 
other streets of what is called the Old 
Town, are only narrow, dirty lanes, 
among houses, some of them 10 and 11 
stories high. Tbe New Town presents 
quite a different aspeci. It is built on tbe 
northern ridge, and its streets and squares 
are not surpassed, in regularity and ele- 
gance, in any part of the world. It com- 
municates with the old town by a bridge, 
and an immense mound of earth crossing 
ft. .Aiibmjr-* a<7Â«(. tijg jggp jpj^ p^ jg^j^g between them. 

On the slope of Anhur*s seat, toward the East, may still be seen the ruins of the ancient chapel 
â– nd hermitage of St. Anthony, mentioned in Scott's tale of the Heart of Midlothian.

The cisilc of Edinbut^h is an ancient fortress on a rugged rocV, mouiitinz abrupllr to tba 
beight of 200 feet. It sunds at the weslera extremity ofHigh street, and tBe vievi n-om iu 
suiDmii always excites the adniiraiion of a traveler. Holyrood House, for inany centuriei 
the residence of the kings of Scotland, is a quadrangular edifice in tbe eastern part of the citTi 

and at present offers a shelter to the 

deibrooed king of France, as ils 
neighborbood does to the insolvent 
debtors of Edinburgh. In the centre 
of the city, is a vest pile, comprising 
several edifices around Parliament 
Square, which contain a number of 
large libraries, one of which, called 
the Advocate's Library, has 150,000 
volumes. 

Tbe Fiih MariM occupies a verr 
convenient spot under the arches of 
a bridge which crosses ibe ravine be- 
tween the old and new town. It \a 
surrounded by covered stalls. 

From tbe plain on the east of the 
central bridge rise the Calton Hill 
end Arthur's Seat ; tbe latter reaches 
the height of 800 feet, presenting tba 
rocky outlines of Salisbury Crags ; 
TU FiA Marlut oi Ediidurgh. â€¢ on the summit of the former is a 

monument to Nelson, a circular col- 
umn, 108 feet high, and upon both heights public walks have been laid out. The royal 
axcbange, the register office, tbe university building, and some of the churches, are am 
the principal public edifices. There are 48 churches and meetinghouses, numerous hospitals, 
tx, in Edinburgh. The manufactures of the town are chiefly those intended to supply thÂ« 
consumption of the inhabitants ; the trades of hookselllng and printing are carried on to a great 
ntent; the Edinburgh Review and Blackwood's Magazine are the most celebrated journals. 
Tbe mwn is cbiefly supported by its courts of justice, whose jurisdiction extends over all 
Scotland, and is noted for ils literary character, a distinction which has'acquired for it the sur- 
mnw of the Modern Athens. Lath, (he port of Edinburgh, is about 2 miles distant from it, but 

the two places are now connected by 
continuous ranges of buildings. Leith 
carries on an actiye trade with the Bal- 
tic and other parts of Europe, and has 
an extensive coasting trade. The Green- 
land whale fishery is also prosecuted 
from Leith. Its docks, pier, and break- 
water deserve mention. Population of 
the two places, 140,000. In (he neigh- 
borhood of Edinburgh is a rock called 
Sanuon't Ribt, which attracts the curi- 
osity of strangers, by the singular ap- 
pearance of one of its faces, which ex- 
I hibits a mass of strata nearly vertical, 

and bearing some resemblaoce to the 

ribs of en enormous giant. 

Itntm'r Mte. Glatgov, the principal city of Scot- 

* land in point of population, ex(en(, matt- 

tfietures, and commerce, is situated upon the Clyde. It is well built, with straight, spacious, 

nd neat streets, and contains several pretty squares and handsome public buildings- Its 

caibedral is tbe finest Gothic church in Scotland, and its university is much celebrated. 

There are several handsome bridges over the Clyde, and the quay extends a quarter of a mile 

down the river, which is navigable for vessels drawing 12 feet of water, to Glas^w. Tbe 



13& SCOTLANIX 

trade o. the place is important and flourishiDg, and its cotlon manufBcturei are very eztensiTa 
Populatioo, 274,000. Large vessels stop 20 miles below Glasgow, at Port GUugotiy t 
preliy little town with 5,300 inbabiunis. The shipping of the two places amounts to 48,000 
ions. The river has latelv been deepened as high up as Glasgow. 

The name of Merdeea js applied to two distinct places, which, howerer, are situated near 
each other, and now form one borough. The city of Old Aberdeen stands on the Don, ud 
the towo of^t; Merdeen on the Dee. Aberdeen is the piiacipal commercial port of Scot- 
land, and is inferior only to Glasgow in the extent of its cotton manufactures. The citixetu 
are also largely eugeged in the Greenland whale fishery. Shipping of the port, 46,200 toss ; 
population, 63,000. The harbor of Aberdeen is spacious and sale, and a large pier has beeo 
erected. There are two universities here, King's College in Old Aberdeen, and MarischiJ 
Cotleee in New Aberdeen. To the north of Aberdeen is Peterhead, a smalltown, vriibi 
good oarbor, engaged in the whale fishery. Its mineral springs are much resorted to. 

â– Dvndtt is an important t^ading town oo the Firth of Tay, with a good harbor improved b; 
piera and docks. The shipping of the port amounts to 33,000 tons, and the population ij 
03,000. The manufactures, commerce, and population are increasing. Opposite the moutb 
of the Tay, at the distance of several leagues from the shore, is the Bell Rock lighthoiue, 
erected upon a rock, which is covered by the sea at high tide. 

Perth, higher up the Tay, an old city, has been the scene of many interesting transacdoni 
recorded in Scottish history, aod was once the residence of the kings of Scotland. It is sit- 
uated under the Grampian Bills ; the scenery around is highly picturesque, and the approach 
to the city is remarkably beautiful. Its cotton and linen manufactures are extensive, and there 
are several literary establishments here. Population, 20,000. 

PaUtey is a targe and opulent manufacturing town, near Glasgow, with 60,000 inhabitants 
Muslins, silks, and coarse cotton goo<Js are extensively manufactured, and there are also dis* 
tJlleries and founderies here. A tew miles north of Paisley is Greenock, a flourishing, irad- 
Mg, and manufacturing town, with one of the best harbors in Scotland. The shipping of tbii 
port amounts to 36,350 tons ; population, 37,000. 

Inverness, the most important town in the northern part of Scotland, and considered tbe 
metropolis of the Highlands, is situated at tbe eastern termination of the Caledonian canal, ll 
contains a royal academy and other public institutions. Population, 11,500. A few milei 
from Inverness, is Culloden Muir, celebrated as tbe scene of the defeat of the adherents of 
tbe Stuarts, io 1746. 

Stirling, on the Forth, is a place of great antiquity, and of much note in Scottish history. 
It is situated on an eminence, terminating in a rock, upon which stands Stirling castle. Pop- 
ulation, 10,700. In the surrounding districts are Batmockbvm, where Bruce defeated the 
English forces ; Falkirk, celebrated as the scene of two famous battles, with 8,300 inbalnt- 
uits, and Carron, noted for its extensive iron foundery ; the species of ordnance, called 
carronades, derives its name, from being first cast bere. 

Among the other towns of Scotland, Dunfermline, noted for its linen manufactures, con- 
tains the remains of a celebrated abbey, and has a population of 13,000 ; Monlrote, on the 

eastern coast, is an active trading town, 
I with 14,000 inhabitants ; Dumfries, m 
the southwest on tbe Niih, has co^side^ 
I able trade and manufactures, with 13,000 
inhabitants ; St. Andreas, once a large 
town, but now reduced to an inconsider- 
able place, contains a celebrated nnive^ 
siiy ; Kilmamock, a flourishing and in- 
creasing manufacturing town in Ayrshire, 
has 19,000 inhabitants y Lanerk contains 
extensive cotlon mills ; DumharUm is 
celebrated for its castle. Lervick, lbÂ« 
capital of the Shetland Isles, and Eirk- 
wall, capital of the Orkneys, have each 
about 3,000 inhabiunts.

It b a little vilkge on the English border, where, for a hundred years, fugitive lovers have 
been accustomed to resort from England to avail themselves of the ready convenience of a 
Scotch marriage. In this country, it is only required of a couple to declare their wish 
before a justice of the peace, or other competent witness, and the marriage is legally effected.. 
Sixty or seventy pair of runaways are usually married every year at Gretna Green. An 
old blacksmith was, for a long time, the priest of Hymen at this noted spot. 

4. â€¢SgricuUwre. The articles cultivated are generally the same as in England. Oats are 
Jie principal crop, except in the most fertile districts. Potatoes are cultivated somewhat ex- 
tensively, and in some places hemp. 

5. Commerce. Both the commerce and manufactures of Scotland have grown into im- 
portance since the union with England. Commerce has flourished chiefly since the middle of 
the last century. Greenock and Jiberdeen are the most important commercial places. The 
shipping of Scotland amounts to 300,000 tons, or about one fourth less than that of the State 
of Massachusetts ; annual value of imports, 24,000,000 ; of exports, 28,000,000. 

6. Manufactures. These consist of cotton, woolen, linen, iron, hats, paper, sailcloth, pot- 
tery, and small quantities of most of the articles made in England. The localities of many of 
tbc^e establishments have already been designated. At Carron^ in the southern part of the 
kingdom, are the most important u*on founderies in Great Britain. They employ 2,000 work- 
men, and cast above 4,000 cannon annually. The total value of the yearly manufactures of 
Scotland is estunated at 70,000,000 dollars, employing 300,000 persons. 

7. FUheriee, The whale and herring fisheries are considerable sources of wealth. The 
whale ships are principally employed in the Northern Seas. The gathering of kelp on the 
shores of the Western Islands once employed 120,000 persons ; but the busmess has now de- 
clined in consequence of the substitution of a cheaper alkali in manufactures. The number of 
herring taken on the coast is immense ; the fishermen zo in small craft, called Busses. 

8. Inhabitants. There are, in Scotland, but few residents except th^ natives ; though 
these difl!er much in the lowlands and highlands. The Scotch are more bony and lean than the 
English, and corpulence is rare. They have generally hard faces, and high cheek bones, and 
their countenances have a hardy and sometimes a weather-beaten appearance. The classes are 
substantially the same as in England, though, as there is much less wealth, there is less di$* 
tinction between the rich and the poor. 

The Scotch fishwomen, or fishwives, as they are called, aie worthy of notice, forming a 
distinct and separate race, who associate almost solely with one another ; and whose features, 
dress, halnts, and occupations are diflferent from those of all the lower classes in Scotland. 
They are of JWse extraction ; and although their language is broad Scotch, it is distinguished 
by a peculiar slang, understood only by themselves. They reside entirely at Mwkaven. 
When their husbands return from a fishing expedition, it is their office to be in readiness to 
mend and dry the nets, and to carry the fish up to the Edinburgh market in baskets, called 
Cruls. They also cry the fish through the streets, carrying the creels upon their backs, and 
by these means collect a considerable quantity of money, which they usually spend in dress. 
Their love of finery, and of bright, showy colors, is excessive. Their dress is a tri-cornered 
handkerchief, of a bright color, pinned round the head in a very becoming manner ; short, red, 
woolen petticoats, and checked aprons. There are several shops in the old town of Edin- 
burgh, chiefly resorted to by these women, where they buy prints of the most extravagant and 
showy pattern, to wear on Sundays. They are, when young, remarkable for the brightness of 
their complexion, fine eyes, and white teeth, and even for grace and regularity of features ; but 
hard work and intemperance render them prematurely old. They are an immoral race, pro- 
verbial for their love of profanity, cheating, drinking, and fighting. When George the Fourth 
visited Edinbui^h, the first persons who congratulated him upon his arrival were a band of 
New haven fishwives, who rowed out in boats to the side of the royal yacht, attired in all their 
finery, and saluted the royal ears with three cheers, more remarkable for noise than harmony. 

9. Dress. The dress of the higher and middling classes, in Scotland, is in every respect 
similar to that of persons of the same rank in England, with perhaps this diflference : that as 
London takes the lead in all matters of taste, the Scotch may be a few days or weeks behind 
their English neighbors with respect to the last fashionable novelties. The dress of the low 
bod peasants is also pretty similar to that of the lower classes among the English, although the 
costume of the women in Scotland seems to retain a more marked and distinctive character. 
It consists of a wbite mob cap, a short gown, made of coarse print, and a coarse, woolen petÂ«

ticnat, either dark blue or red. The sleeves are usuelk tucked up above the elbow. Soms 
times they have' coarse shoes aad stockings, but not uulxequenlly bare feet. On Sundays, tbey 
wear bonnets and gowns in imitation of their betters. Although the lowland dress is nov 
adopted in most parts of the highlands, there are still many parts of Scotland, in the neighbor- 
hood of the Lochs, in the nest of Argyleshire, &c., where the ancient costume is preserved, 
though loose tartan trowsers, called iraw, are usually substituted for the kilt. The dress of a 
Scotch shepherd ts a jacket and trews of coarse, gray tartan, a way tarianplaid, and a flat 
highland bonnet. In the Western Islands, 
where the inhabitants hare necessarily less com- 
munication with the lowlandefs than the high- 
landers on the main, land, the dress is somewhat 
different. The men wear the highland bonnet, 
blue jacket, and trowsers, usually manufaciiired 
in the island, sometimes composed of tartan, and 
at other times of a coarse woolen stuB*; the 
women wear a piece of tartan over their heads, 
something in the form of a veil ; a piece of tartan 
round their necks, fastened with a large broach 
of tarnished silver, in the form of a heart : an 
ornament which is carefully handed down from 
g^^gij^ one generation to another ; extremely short, 

woolen petticoats, with jackets of the same, the 
sleeves of which are tucked up above the elbow, for convenience in working ; all the drudgery 
being performed by the women, while the men lie at ease, chewing tobacco. 

The true Highland costume consists of a tartan jacket, a kilt, which is a short petticoat of 
tartan, plaited all lound, and descending within two inches of the knee. Tartan hose are 
stockings coming near the knees, and gartered with red, worsted riband. A Highlander has a 
peculiar pride in the manner of tying this garter, which, it is supposed, no Lowlander can succeed 
in doing perfectly. Large, silver buckles are worn in the shoes. In the dress of a gentleman, 
the bonnet is of tartan velvet, with a diced border ; the common Highlander's is of tartan 
worsted. This is surmounted by a targe, black plume, fastened with a cairngorm. A chief- 
tain wears, instead of this plume, a long eagle's feather, which no other has a right to adopt. 
Round the waist is a leathern belt, to which is attached the sporran, a purse made of long, 
white goat's hair, intended for holding tobacco. In the belt, is also stuck a pair of pistols, a 
snuff-mill, and a dirk. If the wearer is a person of distinction, the handle of the dirtt is highly 
siudden with jewels. A scarf or plaid is wrapped around the waist, and thrown over the 
shoulder, where it is frequently fastened with a large cairngorm or Scotch pebble. The dress 
ofa Highland Regiment is similar, except that the jackets are red, instead of tartan ; the caps 
are considerably higher, and the black plume larger, and there are no ornaments of jewelry. 
Gentlemen who have property in the Highlands are generally extremely fond of adopting the 
native costume, upon any occasion which may warrant a similar exhibition ; such as a public 
assembly, a fancy or Caledonian ball at Almacks, or a dinner given by the Highland Society, 
whether in Edinburgh or London. Young exquisites, who have probably never visited their 
barren estates, may be seen walking down Bond street, followed by a gigantic Highland piper 
in full costume, who seems to look upon the passing multitude with an eye cf sovereign cod- 
lempt. If the laird gives a dinner to a party of fashionable guests, the piper marches up and 
down before the windows or through the apartment, blowing with all his might ; the drone of 
the bagpipe elTectually drowning the bum of conversation. 

10. Langw^e. The language used in the Lowlands is somewhat different from the Eng- 
lish, but though a stranger is puzzled at the pronunciation, the natives understand whatever is 

. spoken in English. A knowledge of this dialect has been spread wherever English is known, 
by the novels of Scott and Gait, and the poems of Bums. In the highlands and Hebrides, 
the general language is the Erse or Gaelic ; and little English la known except by the higher 
classes. The Gaelic is used by more than 300,000 people. In the Orkney and Shetland 

, Isles the English is universal. 

1 1 . Manner of Building. The private dwellings in Scotland are less elegant and commo- 
dious than in England. In the ancient towns, which have a dismal appearance, the houses are 
generaLy of stone, and many have the ends to the street ; in some, the entrance is in tbe 



SCOTLAND. 1S9 

fecood storjr, by means of exterior stairs, and the descent to the ground floor is within. The 
cottage are many of them mere hovels, in which there is little comfort, and no attempt at 
neatness. These are thatched, and the smoke is conducted out through a barrel placed in the 
thatch* At the front door is the dunghill, which is often the favorite station for the children. 
In the Highlands, which term includes all places where the Erse language is used, they art ' 
more miserable still ; there is no chimney, and the smoke of the peat fires is left to escape by 
a hole in the roof, which is not over the fire, lest the rain should extinguish it. The smoke is 
allowed to circulate through the building, and the whole interior !s glistening with soot. Some 
have no other door than a blanket or hide. There is often but one small window, and this i3 
frequently without glass. 

12. Food and Drink. In these, the Scotch difiTer considerably from the English. Potatoes 
are universal, and oatmeal is generally made into a coarse, but favorite cake, which is consid- 
ered so nmiooal, that Scotland is sometimes called the Land of Cakes. It is preferred to the 
bread of oAuze, which has been imported in seasons of scarcity. It is made, also, into a por- 
ridge of a consistency rather less than that of mush or hasty-pudding. The haggis is a dish 
peculiar to Scotland, where it is much esteemed, though it seldom has the favor of strangers. 
It is made of the entrails of a sheep chopped small, with herbs, onions, suet, and spices ; it is 
eodosed in the maw, boiled, and brought upon the table in the envelope. A sheep's head 
singed is another peculiar dish ; it is not skinned, but the wool is burnt off with a hot iron* 
Kail is more consumed than any vegetable of a similar kind. In Scotland, as in England, 
there is less profusion of food than m the United Statis. 

Whisky, in the Erse language, signifies water, and, in the Highlands, it is almost used as 
such. It is generally distilled (rom barley ; and no man there is so abstemious as to omit a 
morning dran), which is called a stalk. The consumption of whisky is very ereat ; and this 
spirit is perhaps the least deleterious of all the forms of alcohol, and less hurtful in the humid 
climate of the Highlands, than elsewhere. It is drank in large quantities, yet there is 
not a great proportion of the intemperate in Scotland. Even in Edinburgh and Glasgow, raw 
whisky and punch are found at dinner parties ; and the ladies, as well as gentlemen, some- 
times partdce moderately of each. This, however, is less common than formerly ; among 
the refined classes, there is little departure from the customs of England. 

13. Diseases. These are such as are common to a cold and humid climate, as pulmonary 
com|Jaints and rheumatism. Scotland is, however, in the main salubrious, and the people are 
hardy and exempt from disease. 

14. Modes oj TVaoeKng. The roads in Scotland are excellent, and some of those made 
ofer the mountains, designed to render intercourse with th& Highlands more frequent, and thus 
gradually remove the barbarism of the people, are monuments of labor and art. The coaches 
â€¢od steamboats in the southern parts are good ; but the steamboats are, in no part of Great 
Britain, so commodious and elegant as in the United States. The inns are of a lower grade 
than those of England ; and in the Highlands there are few of any kind, and what there are, 
are mere alehouses, litde better in accommodations than the common huts. In some of them 
there are no beds, and the beds that are found are not the exclusive privilege of one traveler. 
Johnson relates, that as he was stepping into one of these, there started up from it ^f a High 
lander, black as a Cyclops from the forge." Among the Highlands, and under this term we 
include the Hebrides, there is no traveling but in boats and on horseback. The traveler 
mounts one of the small ponies, and a Highlander runs by his side as an attendant. It is to be 
remarked, that in Scotland the ^^ real and nominal distances rarely agree," and when a traveler 
asks the distance of one place from another, he seldom receives any very definite information. 

15. Character^ Manners^ &c. The Scotch are adventiurous, yet cautious ; they have much 
shrewdness, though they practise little cunning or deceit. They are persevering, thrifty, in* 
teOigent, and moral. They are grave and sedate, and the Highlanders so much so, that they 
seem almost melancholy. The wild solitude in which they live contribute to this. Th^ 
Scotch are much attached to their country, and are always reluctant emigrants ; in foreign coun- 
tries they are distinguished for their attachment to each otfier. They are the most loyal subjects 
of the crown, though they have heretofore been often in rebellion. They have, in a great deÂ« 
^ree, the principle of fidelity ; and a Highlander, like an Arab, knows not how to betray. 

When Charles Edward was wandering about the Highlands, and a price of Â£30,000 was set 
opon his head, his retreats were known to numbers, and he was sheltered for awhile by twocom^ 
mon tluevesy one of whom was afterwards hanged for stealing a cow of the value of 30 shillings

Before he was executed, be took off his bonnet, and thanked God, that he had never be? 
trayed confidence, never plundered the poor, and never refused to share his bread with Han 
Qeedy and the stranger. 

The Highlanders are even now much attached to the persons of their chief, though the 
time is past when they would avenge his quarrel without examining its merits. The ocotcb 
are very hospitable, and in this the traveler sees a favorable difference between Scotland and 
England. They are also very social, and their suppers are delightful meetings. They are 
held at about nine, and the company separate before twelve. These meetings have little foriD- 
ality, but great freedom and cheerfulness. When they separate, they join hands and sing some 
little song of adieu. The dinners are more formal ; wines are circulated freely, and when the 
cloth is removed, the lady of the house asks the individual guests, without circumlocution, 
^^ will you take a dram? " This consists of whisky, and is taken unmixed ; even the women 
drink. Suppers, as well as dinners, are closed with hpt toddy. All this must be understood, 
however, as now applicable to fewer families than in former days. Though Edinburgh has 
ceased to be the seat of a court as in former days, yet its society possesses a peculiar and 
somewhat national character. It is the focus of learning and letters , many of the nobility re- 
side in the town and immediate vicinity, and though Holyrood*" is deserted, or but the transient 



* During; \he visit of the late king, George the Fourth, 
to Edinburgh, he held what is called a " Dra wing-Room ** 
at Holvro(^ House, the following sketch of which has 
oeen furnished us bv an individual who wasj^resent. 
The description of the presses and etiquette is equally 
applicable to the drawing-rooms held at St. James*s, and 
aSords a vivid picture of what may be regarded as the 
highest occasion of mere court oeremonv in Europe. 
Uolyrood) which for a long period of years had seen her- 
self deserted by her sovereigns, was now about to be en- 
livened bv the roval presence. His Majesty had made 
known his intention of holding a drawing-room, and a 
general note of preparation was sounded throughout the 
Kingdom. All tne taste of the Scottish upholsterers was 
submitted to the judgment of the Ekiinburah dignitaries, 
and various consultaUons were held as to the most appro- 
priate method of rendering the apartments fit for his Ma- 
|esty*s reception. The ducal chambers were at length 
fitted up with a temporary, but befitting magnificence. 
The large hall, which was allotted for the presence-cham- 
ber, was decked in all the splendor of gold and crimson 
drapery. A throne and canopy of crimson velvet and 
gold, was erected at the upper end of the apartment. 
The road between Dalkeith and Holy rood was covered 
with couriers and messengers whose important faces of 
consultation and deliberation showed their fears, lest any 
breach of etiauette should ofiend the criticizing eye of the 
most polished sovereign in Europe. But while the Lord 
Provost, with the bailies and magistrates laid their heads 
together to commune upon these weighty matters, a fairer 
portion of the community were engaged in deliberations 
of another description. All that Gotland had of beauty 
or fashion, of rank or wealth, had congre^ted to the me- 
tropolis on the occasion of the King s visit The peer 
lefl his hall, and the peasant his cottage, to welcome tneir 
sovereign to the land of his forefathers. Every hotel, 
every lodging, Â©veir corner of ever^ house was crowded 
to excess. The difficulty of obtaining anv mode of con- 
veyance became so great, that various fashionable and 
distinguished characters had made their entry in carts 
and wagons. 

A drawing-room, however common in London, even 
there excites a sensation ; and on no occasion is greater 
rivalry displayed whether of dress or equipage. Loyalty 
and vanity go hand in hand ; the former serving as an 
excuse for the latter. But in Edinburgh, where no court 
has resided for centuries, the feeling was totally diff*ercnt. 
Even among those to whom the charm of noveltv wag 
worn off, the idea of a court in Holyrood coninred up a 
thousand romantic feelings. Around that ancient palace 
is thrown a spell which time can never dissolve. Sur- 
rounded as it is by mean and uninteresting buildings, 
who can forget, that these grass-grown entries have echo- 
ed to die tread of Scotland's proudest chivalry ? that by 
that gate, Scotland's fair Queen has rode forth with hawk 



and hound and hu ating-hom, surrounded by her gallant 
train f The walls still seem to ring to the silver tones 
of her voice, and the blood-stained-floor yet gives evi- 
dence of the fierceness of those tumultuous spirits wbr 
darkened her youthful days. A king of the Hanoverian 
line was now about to tread the halls of the Stuarts, and 
Highlander and Lowlander, forgetful of aU ancient fbods, 
alike prepared to do him homage. Old peeresses, who 
since the days of hoops and of Queen Charlotte, had 
resided in their mouldering family mansions^ now began 
to pull out their faded court finery, and to sigh over the 
manifest necessity of procuring new dresses. Their fam- 
ily coronets looked antique and lustreless. The change 
was in the brows that bore them. Toung peeresses, wfio 
had not yet been presented at court, rejoiced in the pros- 
pect of displaying their new coronetted carriages, and 
new set jewels, and all the elegance of white and silver, 
which a bride must of necessity wear, when she first 
comes into the presence of her sovereign. Nearly every 
lady in the kingdom, whose &mily or fortune could in 
any way entiUe her to appear at court, felt a flutter of 
expectation, either as to her personal appearance, or suit- 
able deportment, in a situation which was entirely new 
to her. Some tJiere were, indeed, to whom there wts 
little novelty in the prospect. Toung Indies who had 
passed the ordeal of a London spring; or antiquated dow- 
agers who had carried their rouge and their diamonds 
through twenty or thirty successive London seasons. 

Te^ generally speaking, the occasion was une of unusual 
interest and excitement. The important matter of choos- 
ing a train of a becoming color caused many a sleepless 
night. Velvets and satins, feathers and fineiv of every 
description, floated in bright disorder before their vision 
both mentally and bodily. The tradesmen disposed of 
their goods as if by magic. The milliners* rooms were 
thronged from morning till night with a fair bevy of eager 
and anxious faces. The dancing-masters gave private 
lessons in the most approved mode of performing a court- 
curtesy ; and then came the important question of how 
the train was to be managed. Ladies who had been at 
court instructed their daughters how to hold the long 
drapery under one arm until Uiev came to the door of the 
presentation-room, how then to let it fall with grace, and 
maiestically sweep the dust off the palace floors. Day 
and night the milliners labored incessanUy, yet unable to 
meet Uie increasing demands which were made upon 
their nimble fingers. Of the milliners' girls, some grew 
pale, and others grew sick, and some died ; the shears of 
fate snapping the thread of their life, while their scisson 
were yet in the unfinished gown 

An African would have thought, that an universal 
ostrich hunt had taken place in some neighboring desert, 
or that a tribute of white plumes had been exacted from 
some monarch of Lybia. It was decreed, that no lady 
should wear more than 25 osUich feathers in her hair at

residence of a Ti^itive pnnce, tbare is much elegance, taste, and refinement m the town. In 
(be Londop circles, he who has the highest title has the greatest consideration. In Edinbui^b, 
the society of Scott, Jeffrey, and Wilson is more esteemed thap that of mere dukes and mar- 
quisses. 

â– teed was mingled with the load notes of martial musHk 
Forests of white plumes were waving throogh the ancient 
galleries. To a fanciful mind, it seemed like the invasion 
of a sanctuary, and like treading upon the ashes of the 
dead. AJl eyes were anxiously turned towards the win- 
dows which commanded a view of the Dalkeith road, by 
which the royal carriage was expected to arrive. Now 
was the moment of expectation. Some grew pale ; and 
some grew red; some talked of their fears; and some 
bravelv tried to laugh them off. Various officers of the 
housenold, ushers, and pages, passed and re-passed through 
the apartments, re-assuring the ladies, and observing, in a 
consequential whisper, that his majesty would speedily ar- 
rive. The approach of a carriage and six, occasioned a 
general rush to the windows, and as general an expression 
of disappointment. It was the equipage of the first Lord 
of the bedchamber, the Earl of F. ; and was, perhaps, one 
of the most remarkable specioiensof an outre taste, exhiln 
ited during his majesty s visit The carriage itself was 
green, covered with guding, the F e arms emblazon- 
ed on the panels. It was drawn by 6 erey horses, with 
their poltiiions dressed in tartan. A fat English coach-

hif acoenion to the throne, he had not seen so many un- 
toiled dresses, onroufled fiioes, and wMU white plumes, 
M were displayed in his Scottish drawing-room. 

Hie eventful morning arrived ; and we will venture to 
ny, that a more sleepless night than that which preceded 
it iras seldom passed by the inhabitants of a ffreat city. 
Tbe proirost and the baillies rubbed their hanÂ£ with an 
important air, looked at each other's solemn faces, and 
hoped that all would go off well. By 6 in the morning, 
tliere was a oniversal stir, although the drawing-room 
wu not to take place till 11. It would be difficult to 
compute with any degree of certainty how many eyes 
were at the same moment fixed upon the mirror. The 
gentlemen had one advantage over the ladies. They had 
ilready kissed hands at the levee ; on which occasion an 
amonng mistake was made by a deputation of Edinburgh 
lawyers, who being desired to kiss hands, instead of kneel- 
ing to salute the royal fingers, kissed their own familiarly 
and passed on. The hair-dressers might have had the 
hondred arms of Briareus, and yet found them insuffi- 
cient for the various operations of curling and frizzing 
and tastefully arranging jewels and plumes. The court- 
dress of a lady consists of a fown or some rich material, 
perhaps white satin, embroidered in gold; the train, 
vhieh is several yards in length, is composed of velvet, 
lilk, or satin, eitlier white or colored, and embroidered to 
sait the dress. Tbe sleeves are short, with laoe ruffles. 
Lappets of Bmseels lace are fastened to the top of the 
bead, and depend as low as the waist. The head-dress is 
abfty plume of ostrich feathers, usually mingled with 
aipetles of diamonds, and other rich ornaments, such as 
SMklaces, earrings, bracelets, belts, and stomachers of 
diamonds are worn in the greatest profusion. The gen- 
tieman's oourt-dress is infirutely Jess graceful and becom- 
ing. A coat, cut in a peculiar antique fashion, usually 
eomposed of claret-colored cloth, and embroidered at tlie 
pockets, collar, and wristbands; point lace ruffles; an 
esibroidered waistcoat; white silk stockings, and knee- 
breeches of white casimir ; shoes with silver or diamond 
backles; a long sword, and a ehapeau de broiy form a 
oostnme which ma^ be suited to an elderly and courtly- 
jooking person, ^nng him the air of a Sir Charies Grand- 
isott, bat which is very apt to bestow upon a young gen- 
tleman the appearance of having stepped into a suit of his 
grandfather's clothes. By 10 o'clock the streets were 
eovered with carriages hastening towards Holy rood. 
Probably at no periodliad such a scene of varied magnifi- 
orace been displayed in Edinburgh. Bodies of cavalry 
and infantry; the Lancers, with their gay scarlet uni- 
fivms; the Scotch Greys, with their heavy helmets and 
bandsome horses; the Highland regiments in blue bon- 
aet and philabeg ; the Royal Archers in their suits of 
Uneoln green ; the Earl-mareschal with his pages in 
black velvet and silver ; these, together with the tasteful 
â€¢ad splendid equipages, the innumerable foot passengers, 
tbe windows and balconies crowded with heaas, all com- 
bined to form a prospect which almost fatigued the eye 
bj its variety and magnificence. 

toth the court-yard of the palace, and the streets in its 
ridnity were covered with an endless file of chariots and 
coaches ; from tbe windows of which innumerable plum- 
ed beads were bending, and eyes anxiooslv watching the 
â– oawnt when their turn to enter was likely to arrive. It 
â€¢ame at last ; and through long files of gucds, and pages, 
aad ushers, bespeaking all tl^ mingled bustle and eti- 
^ette of a royal mansion, the company passed on to the 
nOery allotted for their reception. And a^ain old Holy- 
tood echoed to the tread of light and joyous footsteps. And 
ma bright eyes, and sparkling jewels lit up her desolate 
<aambers. And her moss-grown court-yard rang to the 
Inaip of the war-horse, and the neighing of the proud 



man looked uneasy upon his box, in the novel acquisition 
of a kilt. Beside him, sat a foreign chasseur, with a plum- 
ed cap. Two fbotmen, in kilts, stood behind the carriage. 
Four out-riders, in tartan trews, galloped beside it. Four 
runners, in tartan kilts, exerted ail the speed of their long 
Highland lejps, to keep up with the prancing gre^s. The 
Earl himself, in full Highland costume, with kilt, dirk, 
and bonnet, completed the incongruous appearance of the 
whole. At last, the royal carriages were seen approaching 
at full speed ; the King in a crimson colored coach, drawn 

by six white horses, the Dukes of Mâ€” e and A 1 

on either side of him, and the Lords of the Bedchamber 
in separate carriages, with the royal liveries. In a few 
minutes, the doors of the gallery were thrown open, and Sir 
Hussev Vivian, a tall and fine-looking person, in a cona- 
plete oress of black sable, and holding a white staff in his 
nand, announced, that his majesty reouested the honor of 
the ladies' company in the presence-cnamber. 

Now came the rustling or trains, and the movement of 
plumes ; and for once, even ladies of rank were disposed 
to yield precedence to each other. The company passed 
along through two files of guards, stationed in the ante- 
chamber. The utmost silence prevailed, broken onljr by 
a few anxious whispers, either of inquiry or information. 
Among the first who entered the presence-chamber, was 

the young and lovely Countess of G y, attired in 

all her bridal splendor, yet pale and shrinking, like a whilt 
rose half concealed in its silver leaves. 

At the door of the royal apartment, the lady relinquishes 
the arm of the gentleman who escorts her, fives her card 
to an usher of Uie white rod, stationed for Uie purpose of 
receiving it, pulls off her lefl glove, and lets down her 
train. Her name is then called out by the usher, together 
with that of the Lady^ under whose auspices she is pre- 
sented. " Miss or Mrs , by the Countess of " 

She then proceeds up the room, and it must be confessed, 
that she requires some courage to advance alone, through 
a laree apartment, with the eyes of the King and his smie 
fixedupon her. His majesty stands in full dress, surround- 
ed by tne officers of his household, and by several ladies of 
rank, who have the privilege of the entree. Having ad- 
vanced up to the King, the lady gives another card to \ha 
Lord in waiting, who stands benind him. Her name is 
again read out, upon which his majesty comes forward* 
takes her hand, salutes her on the led cheek, says a lew 
words to her, either of compliment or inquiry, and makes 
a low bow ; a sign that the conference is ended. The lady 
curtsey very low, and retires backward towards the door. 
As this operation is somewhat diffic^jlt to perform with a 
long train, the ushers of the white rod are in attendance to 
beat it back, and rescue the wearer from die inevitabk

SCOTLAND. 



Tbe Scotch are obliged to be frugal, yet they are not without charity. It is said, that it 
England, there is more public spirit, and in Scotland more individual charity. There are h6 
legal provisions for the poor, and except in the large towns, no hospitals or almshouses, yet 
charity affords a sufficient relief. The beggars are neither importunate nor clamorous ; for i 
Scotchman solicits cbarity with the dignity of a Castilian. Orphans are' often distributed ano 
brought up in families. There are some points of resemblance in the character of the Scotcb 
and that of the people of New England. If the Scotch are not cheerful, they are even-tert* 
pered, and at times they are given to merriment. At Edinburgh, on the last night of the year, 
It is the custom to sup abroad : at 12 O'clock, on the striking of the bells, the people sally forth 
in such numbers, that all seetn to be abroad. It is a night of revelry. The watchmen retire 
from their rounds, and any lady, who is abroad by accident, or design, is liable to be saluted, 
and the severity of the custom is seldom relaxed in favor of any rank. 

The domestic comforts of the Scotch are increasing by communication with the Englisb, 
though many of the Highlanders Â«are still in a condition hardly superior to barbarism. The 
useful arts are comparatively little known, and a traveler may see a horse drawing home the 
harvest in a crate, with a stick under his tail for a crupper, held at each side by a twist ofstratv. 
It is, perhaps, peculiar to a part of Scotland, ^^ to have attained the libera?, without the manual 
arts." Families of refinement and education, and not without means, have lately lived in the 
Highlands with fewer conveniences than an English cottager, and with no floor in (heir houses, 
but the damp earth. In these houses, however, the stranger would be received with true hos- 
pitality, and the proprietors are, in the strictest signification of the word, gentlemen. All the 
relatives of a chief are his equals, or, according to the Spanish proverb, *' as good gentlemen 
as the king, only not so rich." Boswell relates, that when he was at Inverara, the Duke of 
Argyle asked one of his remote cousins, of the name of Campbell, and of course gentle, to 
bring something from the next room, which he did readily, though he whistled, as if to show 
the visiters that he was no menial, but was willing to oblige Macallumore. The country gen- 
tlemen are often called by the name of their estates. It is not needful to commend the Scotch 
character to the people of the United States, where they are excellent citizens, and the most 
desirable class of emigrants. Many of them have settled in Canada, and they appear to be fond 
of associating in such a manner as to form communities of their own. 

The natives of the Hebrides are a hardy race, remarkable for their strong attachment to their 
native islands, and for retaining in their character much of that ancient Highland pride, and feudtd 
fidelity, the traces of which are growing fainter, and less marked, every successive generaUon. 
Nothing can be more singular to the eye of a stranger, than the first view of a village in tbe 
Hebrides. At a distance, a large volume of black smoke is seen slowly ascendmg, apparently 



tumble, which would be the consequence of her becomin|r 
entangled in it Finally, they gather it up, and put it into 
her hand at the door. 

The gentlemen merely pass with a bow, unless the King, 
being acquainted with them, detains them a few moments 
in conversaUon. O*: the present occasion, his majesty 
wore a field marshars uniform, a daik blue coat and dia- 
mond star, with a broad green ribbon. The Earl of 
â€” , who stood behind him, reminded him as the ladies 
entered, that such a one had formerly been a celebrated 
beauty, and had appeared at the late Queen*s drawing- 
rooms ; that such another was the widow of a celebrated 
general or admiral. The king's memory, and the king's 
politeness, were, therefore, equal themes of admiration. 
Upon the whole, the ladies looked fresher, and more able 
to bear the light of the sun, than in a similar assemblage 
at St James's. Rouge, which looked like brick dust by 
the morning light, was chiefly confined to old and shriv- 
eled dowagers, and the king had little occasion to use the 
white pocket handkerchief, with which he sometimes finds 
it necessary to rub off the rouge that adheres to his lips. 
True, there were some awkward blunders; but his majesty 
usually turned his broad shoulders on the ofiibnder, &nd 
afiTected to peroeive nothing that was disagreeable. A 
lady became entangled in her train. The white rods had 
forgot their duty. She whirled round and round like a 
bone entangled in his bridle, and finally became literally 
inelosed in a sack, fi<om which there was no escape. Just 
â– â€¢ she was about to fall forward, she was arrestea by some 
fttvndly hand.. One yery beautiful young lady miatoek 4 



lord in waiting for the king. It was said that -his lordchip 
usurped the royal privilege, and then informed her of her 
mistake. A very fat personage, whether from excess of 
awe, or from having stumbled over some unknown ob 
stacle, no sooner came up to the king, than she fell upon 
her knees before him. It was too much, even for conrtlj 
etiquette. The soite bit their rods, and tiUered. The king 
applied his handkerchief to his face. The unfortunate 
little woman remained in the same position, her face grad- 
ually assuming a darker hue of purple, until some humane 
Eerson, blessed with a strong pair of arms, placed her upon 
er feet ; whereupon she made a hasty retreat. " Mn. 

B ," said his majesty, cnsting a sad glance on an oW 

beauty with a frizzled wig, false teeth, and corked eje- 
brows, '* I cannot help remarking, tliat we arc neither of 
us so young as we have been." 

A few privileged persons remained in the presrntatioa 
room during the ceremony, but tht generality returned to 
the other apartments, and much amusement was excited 
among the guard of archers in the ante-rooms, at fJie ap 
prehensive faces of those who went in, and the lelieyed 
air of those who came out. One of the roost fttrikin| 
looking persons was the Duchess of A., in a co\oplete 
dress of gold brocade, with a head-dress of black ploroet 
and diamonds. After standing for upwards of three boari, 
bis majesty having received and dismissed bis compiDV, 
made a general bow to tbe assembly, and hastily took hii 
departure by an opposite door. One by one tbe carnage 
drove off, and Hdy rood vraa, onee more, left to fiknoe and

out of the ground. TbÂ« tmvder approaches a Ittde nearer^ and pBtc^t&B, dmt h proceeds 
from a collection of low mounds, or hillocks of mud, and it is only upon a closer survey, that 
he discovers them to be human habitations. These black huts, as they are appropriately named, 
coDsist of 4 low mud walls, with a roof of ill-thatched heather ; the smoke coming out of the 
door, which serves as a chimney, or not unfrequently the people going in at the chimney, which 
serves as a door. Within this miserable dwelling, the whole establishment, consisting of men, 
woineo, and children, 7 or 8 lank-looking Highland ponies, called shelties, and half a dozeft 
starving cattle, are usually assembled promiscuously round a peat fire, in the middle of the 
room ; a few rude wooden benches, and one or two chaff beds, m niches, with coarse blankets, 
QMnufactured by the people, form the articles of furniture. The whole is enveloped in a cloudy 
ttmospbere of smoke, with an overpowering smell of peat, tobacco, and whisky. 

The better tenantry are contented with tne luxury of a separate chimney and door ; and the 
addition of an outhouse for the cattle and ponies. Individuals, worth 4 or 5,000 dollars, are 
often perfectly satisfied with a similar habitation. When they are obliged by order of the propri- 
etor to leave their huts, they carry most of the rude materials along with them, for the con-* 
sutiction of others upon the same plan. Till within late years, they had no gardens attached 
to these dwellings. A few cabbages and onions are now cultivated in a spot of ground near 
each hut ; but this being considered an innovation, was introduced with difficulty ; and a stand 
was made against it by all enemies to reform. Carts are unknown ; a crooked spade with a 
long handle, serves instead of a plough. A laboring man* will work for a whole day with no 
other food than a few handfuls of oatmeal moistened with cold water. Their principal food 
consists of cakes made of barley or oatmeal, dry and burnt, with a strong smell of peat smoke ; 
salt herrings, when they can be procured, and miserable potatoes. They ako eat a species of 
sea-weed, called dulse-and-tangle, either raw or boiled, and prepared like spinach. In years 
of scarcity, whole families have subsisted upon sea-weed and small shell-fish, such as cockles, 
buckies, and periwinkles. 

The chief source of profit to the West Highland proprietors, is in the manufacture of kelp, 
which is used in making soap, glass, &c. The kelp is made from sea-weed, which grows oo 
the rocks, and produces a regular crop, cut down every second year with sickles, in the same 
manner as com. It is collected when the rocks are uncovered at low tide, and carried out in 
boat-loads to the nearest island. It is then left to dry in the sun, and afterwards burnt. On a 
dark night, the numerous kelp-fires produce a singular effect. On these occasions, all the vil- 
lages are deserted, and the inhabitants bivouac in the open air till the kelp harvest is ended. 
Vessels are sent from Liverpool to take in the cargoes. A great part of these islands is cov- 
ered wiih large tracts of sand which, it is feared, will eventually overspread a great portion of 
the arable land. Various attempts have been made to stop the progress of this flying sand, 
which frequently blows froniAue island to another. The only experiment which has in some 
measure succeeded, has bedpin the planting of bent, a species of long grass, with a remark- 
tblv strong root, which not only fixes the sand, but renders it capable of producing rich clover 
and excellent pasture for cattle. 

Gaelic is still the universal language of the Highlands, though English is spoken by those who 
are in the habit of visiting the Lowlands. The religion is Roman Catholic and Presbyterian, 
lo North and South Uist, and Lewis, the former is most prevalent. Presbyterianism is more 
common in the other islands. The women, with a few exceptions, are almost universally ugly, 
owing to hard work and constant exposure to bad weather. The men are better looking, lazy, 
and not strong. Tbey are an unprovident race ; careless of the future, and extravagantly fond 
of dancing to the bagpipes and singing. Tobacco and whisky are their great luxuries. The 
poverty of their food and wretched manner of living, render rheumatic complaints and premature 
decay very common ; yet there are various intances of extraordinary longevity among the inhab- 
itants. They are all good seamen, fearless, and daring ; and where they have been induced 
to emigrate, they have been usually remarked for quickness of perception, and a good natural 
capacity. But no land, however favored by nature, or adorned by art, appears to the High- 
lander equal in beauty to his own barren rocks and heathery moors ; and in these Western 
Uands, scarcely an instance is known of any individual, however distant his wanderings, who 
bs not returned to lay his bones in the shadow of his own native hills. 

It is a common sport, or rather a frequent employment, at St. Kilda, and othe# islands, to

with this, (be part of bim who "galben 
samphire " on ihe Dover cliffs is one of 
safety and pleasure. In ihe cavities of the 
beetling ciags the sea-fowl resort, and (be 
natives, hy means of a rope about iheirbodv, 
overhang precipices nearly one fourihola 
mile Id height, merely to look over idiicli 
would disorder any common nerves. Yet 
the adventurer, with a line of many fath- 
oms, held hy several companions above, 
descends, and disengaging himself from 
the rope, enters cavities in the rock, 
higher than the arch of any gothic church. 
This 15 not without danger ; and many 
perish from falling stones, and other cuu- 
allies. It is recorded, that one of iheM 
adventurers discovered that the rope bj 
Bird Cctdang. which he was suspended was so much 

chafed by an edge of the rock, that he 
bung by a single strand ; be could not give immediate signals to his comrades, and when be 
was drawn up, it was found that the extremity of his (error had been such as to blanch his hair. 
From the tops of these dizzy precipices, the mountainous waves breaking below seem like rip- 
ples, and the roar can hardly be beard. 

16. ^muatmtrdi. These are chiefly such as are common in England, except bull-baiting, 
cock-fighting, and pugilistic combats. Quoits are common, and there is a favorite game of 
ball, called golf, which is often played with great animation on the beach. The field sports are 
not neglected, and the streams abound with excellent fish, while the heath and mountains bive 
much game. Dancing is a general amusement, but except in the cities it displays nioreagitiiy 
(ban grace. 

17. Education. The Universities of Scotland are somewhat different froni those of Eng- 
land- Instruction is communicated by professors, who deliver public lectures, and not by tbe 
private lessons of tutors, as in England There are also many minor points of difference. 
There are 4 Universities in Scotland. That of St. Andnm was founded in 1458, and is 
composed of 3 colleges with 11 professors. That of Glaigow was founded in 1453, and hu 
18 professors. That of tSberdeen has 3 colleges, each of which is styled a University ; bolb 
have 18 professors. That of Edinburgh was founded in 1581, and has 27 professors ; in 
medical classes are attended by students from all quarters of th^rorld, and the whole number 
usually exceeds '2,000. The High School, and Madtmy of Ecffburgh contain together above 
1 ,000 scholars. Common schools are established by law in every parish, and in many of tbe 
larger towns are charity schools and academies. 

In some districts there is more intelligence among the laboring class, than in that of any 
other country. In ihe Highlands it is very different. In 1633, there were 70 in 100 of thÂ« 
inhabitants of the Hebrides who could not read, and in Argj'leshire and the interior of Caiib 
ness, there were but 30 in the 100, and in Orkney and Zetland 13 in (he 100,. that coald 
read. In these districts, above one (bird of the inhabitants are not within 2 miles of a school, 
and many thousands not within five, 

The laws provide for one school in every parish, besides which there are numbers of pri- 
vate schools. Tbe peasantry of the Lowlands have made admirable use of all the advantage! 
within their reach. They are to a great degree intelligent ; and have more taste and refine- 
ment than can elsewhere be found in the same class. In Iceland, Ihe common people may be 
equally or more learned, but they have infinitely less taste. Tbe popular ballads and songs, 
and the sweet music, necessarily circulate much taste, feeling, and poetry. The Scotch have 
Ihe advantage of excellent books, adapted to their own dialect, which is read wherever the 
English language is known. From one of their cottages has arisen a peasant, one of the most 
extraordinary men of his age, who wrote upon things familiar to his countrymen and class, aod 
whose works are indelibly fixed in their hearts. His feme has gone over the earth, ^nd wbo 
n there in Scotland, that can read, who is not as familiar with the thoughts of Burns, as his 
own ; those who cannot r^ad also are familiar with his strains, which are more tender thaa

107 inspired hy the muse of Tibulliu. The novek of Scott are in every cottage, and caoMl 
but elevate the character of the peasantry. James Hogg was a shepherd, and Wilson, our 
oroithologist, was of an humble grade of life. There is among parents a ^eat desire to gir^ 
their children a good education ; and often, bv great parsimony, one is sent to the university, 
Ediobuigh is called, and not without reason, the Northern Athens. / 

18. JfrtSj Sdenctij &c. The useful arts have not until lately been much encouraged ; the 
division of labor has not been understood. Most things used in a family have generally been 
inaoafactured in it. In painting, the Scotch have produced few masters. Wilkie, however, 
is aorivalled in his scenes of familiar life. Music is a national passion. The bagpipe will 
excite a Scotchman, as the fandango animates a Spaniard. It is, however, an imperfect instru* 
ment, and to be well' played must be in the hands of a master. The old national airs which 
Burns has ^^ wedded to immortal verse,^' are known beyond the limits of Scotland. Their 
oriein is lost, though some of them are supposed to have been composed by Rizzio, aiul other 
(taJian masters of that age. Some of them are unrivalled in pathos, and others in liveliness* 
Much of the music is d* a melancholy cast, and even the convivial songs have a touch of this, 
tboi^ eminently adapted for convivial purposes.* 

19. Religion, This is Presbyterian, and the church government was secured by the 
treaty of imion. This government is founded on an equality of authority, among the pres- 
byters, or pastors. There are 903 parishes ; though diere are more pastors than parishes. 
In matters of discipline, a pastor is aided by ruling elders. The latter watch over morals, 
catechize and visit the sick, and manage the funds of the poor, which are chiefly collected at 
the church door. The ministers and elders compose a kirk, or church session, the lowest 
ecclesiastical court. It inflicts ecclesiastical censures on parishioners convicted of immoral 
conduct, &c., thoueh there is an appeal to the presbytery, which is die next higher court* 
This is composed of pastors of several contiguous parishes, with a ruling elder from each par* 
isb. Synods are composed of several presbyteries, and a ruling elder from each kirk ses^on* 
The General Assembly f is the highest council, and is composed of 200 ministers and 89 
elders, representing presbyteries, 69 representing royal boroughs, and 5 ministers or elders 

their circmnstancet. And 80 we find in fiict Uiat their 
music is. The wildest irregolaritj appears in its eompo- 
â€¢itioa; the ezfurestion is warlike ana melanoholj, and 
approaches even to the terrible. Some of Uie southern 

Sroyinces of Scotland present a vetj different prospect 
mooth and lovelj hills covered with verdftro; dear 
streams windln|f through long and beautiful valleys ; trees 
produced without cuHure, here stra^gUng single, and 
there crowding into little groves and^wers, with other 
circumstances peculiar to we districts I allude to, render 
them fit for paaturags, and favorable to romantic lebnre and 
tender passions. Several of the old Scotch songs take 
their names from the rivulets, villages, and hills adjoin- 
ing the Tweed near Melroset such as Cowden Knows, 
Galawater, Ettrick Banks, Braes of Yarrow, Bush above 
Traquair, Slo. All these songs are sweetly and powers 
fully expressive of love and tenderness, and other emo* 
tlons suited to the tranquillity <^ pastoral life. It is 4 
common opinion, that these songs were composed by Da* 
vid Rizzio, a musician from Italv,the unfortunate favorite 
of a very unfortunate queen, ^t this must be a mistake | 
the style of Uie Scotch musio was fixed before his time : 
for many of the best of these tunes are ascribed by tradi- 
tion to a more remote period." 

t In tke discussions of the Assembly at Edinburglv 
there is perhaps more personality, and less decorum tmm 
in the JEIouse of Commons, or almost any other body of 
the same dignity. The speeches are often vehement 
and not vnfrequenUy tMgrj. Many of the members are 
men of great talent, ana the eloquence of Chalmers is 
sometimes displayed here to the best advantage. The As* 
semblv is opened by the king's conmiissioner, who is 
usually a nooleman of high rank. He has an elevated 
seat, where he appears every day during the session. But 
he is raited out, and takes no part in we proceedings of 
the Assembly* When the business of the session is done, 
he proceeds to close it in the name of his Majesty, the 
Head of the Church, dec The moderator then rises ana 
saysjj' In the name of Jesus Christ, the onlv true head of 
the Church, I deÂ«larÂ» this Assembly now closed.*' 



* The fiiUowioff remarks on Scottish music bv Dr. 
Betttae, are beautiful^ descriptive of Scotland, ana hap- 
ffly illustrate the subiect to wkich th^ refer. " There is 
t eertain style of melodv peculiar to each musical coun- 
try, which the people of tnat country are apt to prefer to 
every other styM. That they should prefer their own is 
â– ot ssrpriaing; and that the melody of one people should 
&Skt from that of another is not more surprising, per- 
hapi, than that the language of oiie people should differ 
frMn that of another. But there is something not un- 
worthvof notice in the particular expression and style 
thitebaracterixe the music of one nation or province^ and 
Â£stin^ish it fVom every other sort of music. Of^ this 
diTemty, Soodsod supplies a striking examole. The 
Bstive melody of the Highlands, and Western Isles is as 
diiierent from that of the southenipart of the kingdom, as 
the Frith or Erss language is diflerent flrom the English 
flrSeeteh. 

**The Highlands of Scotland are a picturesque, but in 
{eneial, a melancholv country. Long tracts of rooun- 
tttBons desert, covered with dark heath, and often obscur- 
Â«i bv misty weather ; narrow valleys thinlv inhabited, 
tad bounded by precipices, resounding witn the fall of 
tnnents ; a soil so rugged, and a climate so dreary, as in 
â– toy psirts to admit neither the amusements of pasturage, 
oor the labors of agriculture ; the mournful aaflhing or 
waves along the friUis and lakes that intersect the coun- 
try ; the portentous noises, which every change of the 
wisd, and every increase anH diminution of the waters is 
i9t to raise in a lonely region, foil of rocks, and caverns ; 
tss frotessoe and ghastly appearance of such a landscape 
bf Uw li^t of the moon ; objects like these diffuse a 
gloem ,over the fiuicy, which may be compatible enough 
with oeeasiooal and social merriment, but cannot fail to 
tetms the tiioaffhts of a native in uie hour of silence 
ttdselitede.

from QDiverstties. The Assembly sits aDDually at Edinburgh, io May, 10 days. Tbe paston 
are all entitled to a bouse and glebe land, equal to J6 40 a year, and to receive from parish 
tithes or the exchequer, Â£ 160 a year ; some have much more, or nearly Â£ 1,000, though 
the average income is Â£300. In populous parishes there are chapels of ease, where the min- 
isters are elected by the heads of families, and paid chiefly by the rent of seats. There are 
38 missionaries in remote parts of the Highlands, supported by the crown, and the Society 
for propagating Christianity has a few. There is, besides, a large and respectable body of 
Dissenters, Presbyterians, and others, more numerous than the established church. 

The Scotch are a very pious, as well as moral people ; there are few children of 10 years 
who have not by heart the Assembly's Catechism ; and there is generally family worship 
twice a day. On Sundays, the roads are thronged with people in their best dresses, going tu 
church ,* and at church, they are remarkable for their close attention to the services. When 
George the Fourth visited Edinburgh, he went to church on Sunday. He is said to have re- 
marked with astonishment as he went through the streets, ihat the people did not follow him, 
but that each individual went straight to his accustoqped place of worship. The monarch is 
said to have expressed great respect for conduct which seemed to display such steadfastness 
of principle, while at the same time their loyalty was unquestionable. 

20. Funerals. These generally are conducted somewhat as in New England ; though in 
the highlands the dead are sometimes buried after the Gaelic manner, with feasting and festivity, 
with the coronach or funeral dirge, and with the shrieking of women, as in some eastern coun- 
tries. The funeral festivity, which is carried to great excess, is called the Lyke^wake, In 
Edinburgh, and in most of the towns, there are great processions at funerak, and all the rela- 
tives of the deceased, including the most remote, are expected to attend. It is said, that every 
roan keeps a black coat ready for such occasions. 

21. Marriage's, These are usually performed by the clergy as in our country, but a justice 
of the peace is allowed to perform the ceremony ; even a declaration of the parties before a 
competent witness is sufficient to answer the law. The blacksmith at Gretna Green was resorted 
to by the English fugitives, as such a witness, only because he happened to be upon the border, 
at a point easily accessible. 

22. Superstitions. The Scotch had formerly, and even recently, many superstitions, that 
were so deeply rooted as to have an influence in common affairs. These are fast disappearing, 
though many of them are of a highly poetical character. The Highlanders, in a particular 
manner, were liable to this influence, both from their ignorance, and the solitudes in which 
they lived. They dwell among the wild and grand scenes of nature, among lakes, mountains, 
and waterfalls. Many of the natural phenomena of these were referred to supernatural causes, 
and the glens and mountains were peopled, in the Highlander's fancy, with imaginary beings* 
who were not always supposed to be benevolent. 

The principal of these were the fairies, who were supposed to exchange children with the 
people, and to take away some, of great purity of mind, to fairy land. They were called, 
when spoken of, ^^ the good people," from a wish to conciliate them. There was, and there 
is now much belief among the rustics in omens and other indications of futurity, and many a 
lass goes forth at Halloween with certain ceremonies, to look for the image of her future bus- 
band. There were several kinds of divination, the most solemn of which was this. A man 
slept at night near a waterfall, wrapped in the fresh hide of a bull, and in the morning his an 
swers were taken for responses. The *^ second sight " was the faculty bestowed on a few of 
seeing the representation of a future event ; as a death, a funeral, a massacre, or a mere casua. 
visiter passmg before their eyes. It would come upon the seer unawares, as 

" Coming events cast their shadows before." 

23. Government. Scotland, notwithstanding the accession of James the Sixth to the throne 
of England, was nevertheless a separate kingdom for above a century afterwards. In 1707, a 
union was effected between the two kingdoms, under the name of Great Britain. The United 
Kingdom is represented by one parliament ; and it is settled by the articles of union, that when 
Britain raises by a land tax Â£ 2,000,000, Scotland shall raise Â£ 48,000. The laws relating to 
trade, customs, and the excise, are the same in both countries ; but all the other laws of Scot 
land remain in force, though alterable by the parliament of Great Britain, yet with this caution : 
that laws relating to public policy are alterable at the discretion of the parliament : but laws 



SCOTLANa UT 

fditbg t^ private right are not to be changed, but for the evident utility of the people id 
Scodand. As tne municipal laws of Scodand are generally preserved, those of England are 
not in force. Acts of parliament extend to Scotland, except when it is declared by express 
proviso to be otherwise. 

Scotland was formerly but very imperfectly represented in the imperial parliament, and even 
at present, the number of her representatives is small, although that of the voters has been ma- 
tenally enlarged by the reform act of 1832. It now has 53 members in the House of Com- 
mons, who are returned by the inhabitants paying a yearly rent of 1 pounds, or possessing 
property yielding that sum. Scotland has also 16 peers in the House of Lords, who are 
elected from time to time by the whole body of the Scottish peerage. A few of the ancient offices 
peculiar to the country, have been retained since the union, among which may be mentioned 
the LAfon king at armSj or Grand Herald of Scotland, formerly an office of great splendor. 
The old custom of wappen Bhatoing^ in which the sheriff of the county mustered the militia, is 
also retained, and the officers receive their commissions from the sheriff. 

34. Banki, The Bank of Scotland has a capital of a million and a half sterlmg. No indi- 
ridual can possess more than Â£ 40,000 of the stock. The Royal Bank has also stock of a 
million and a half. The BritUh Linen Company^ and the Commercial Banking Company^ are 
similar institutions. The capital of the latter is three millions. They all issue notes ; but not 
under one pound. There are several private banking institutions, but they do not generally 
bsne notes. Their transactions are confined to discounting. 

25. Latos. These have a similar origin with those of Lngland, and much resemble them. 
The jury is composed of 15, and a majority is sufficient for a verdict. 

26. Jlntiguities. The reformation in Scotland was attended with so much violence, that 
among the antiquities are many ecclesiastical ruins ; Knox taught his disciples, that the best 
way to exterminate the rooks, was to '^ pull down their nests," and many a noble abbey and 
cathedral were destroyed. Some of these buildings remain entire, and of the ruins, Melrose 
Abbey is the most visited. There are ancient castles of various forms, and different degrees 
of preservation. Some are entire and occupied. There are a few circles of upright stones 
as in England, though of less size, and there are circular Danish forts, and some round, narrow 
towers, upwards of 100 feet in height. The vitri6ed forts are curious ; one of them in Ros- 
shire is 120 feet in length, and 40 in breadth. It is glazed on the inside, but whether by art 
or casual fires is not known. The Roman remains are indistinct. The fortified line, between 
the Forth and Clyde, may be barely traced in many places. It is called AgricoWs Wall and 
Grukam*8 Dyke, Roman highways may be traced as*far north as Angusshire, and there are 
several camps, though nearly obliterated. 

27. History. Little is known of the state of Scotland before the 11th century. At 
this time, the country had its king, and was engaged in wars with England. The aggressions 
of the English kings were at first repelled, but Edward the First succeeded in bringing the 
cooQtry into a state of dependence, and placing a creature of his own upon the throne of Scot- 
hod. The celebrated William Wallace roused his countrymen to resistance, and waged a 
deadly war against the English, but was betrayed, taken, and beheaded in London. Robert 
Brace consummated the revolt begun by Wallace, and the victory of Bannockburn, in 1314, 
reestablished the independence of Scotland. Notwithstanding this success, the kingdom was 
long afterwards the theatre of perpetual turbulence, and the Stuarts, who shortly afterwards came to 
the throne, were the moÂ«t unfortunate monarchs that ever reigned. James the Sixth of Scotland 
received the crown of Enj^land by legacy, from Queen Elizabeth, who had put his mother, the 
celebrated Mary Queen of Soots, to death upon the scaffold. Scotland and England, though 
distinct kingdoms, were from this period governed by a single monarch. In 1707, the two 
kingdoms wereÂ« bv legislative acts, united, under the name of the Kingdom of Great Britain.

CHAPTER V. IRELAND. 



DutUn ; viae on liU Liffty. 
PHYSICAL GEOORAPHT. 

1. Boundariet and Exlent. Ireland is aQ island separated od the east from Eogland by St. 
George's Chaaael, and the Irish Sea,^Dd od the noritieast from Scotland by the narrow strait 
of Port Patrick- It extends from 51'= atf to 55Â°20'N. latitude ; and from 5Â° Sff lo lO^Stf 
W. longitude. IlE greatest length from northeast to southwest is about 300 miles, and its 
greatest breadth 160. There Is not a spot upon it 50 miles from the sea. It contains about 
30,400 square miles. 

2. Mountains. The highest ridges of this island are usually io short lines, or detached 
groups. They are not sufficiently numerous or connected to give it the character of a mouD- 
tainous country. They are not bold or precipitous, but iheir sides are gentle acclivities^ 
admitting of culture a considerable way toward tiie summits. The highest mountain is Gur- 
ran Tual, in the county of Kerry, in the southwestern part of the island, 3,400 feet above 
the sea. The shores, particularly In the west, are the most mountainous parts. 

3. Rivert. The largest is the Shannon, which Bows southwest iuto the Atlantic. It is 
about 170 miles in length, runs through several lakes or Lovghi, and widens at its mouth 
belotf Limerick to a spacious bay ; it is deep and navigable. The Barrow flows south about 
100 miles to the sea, at Waterford. The Foyle and Bann are small streams which fall into 
the sea at the northern extremity ; the latter discharges the waters of Lough Neagb. The 
Boynt is of historic interest. 

4. Laka. The Irish name fcr lake is Lough. There are large numbers of them in the 
island. Lough J^Teagh ta the northeast is the largest ; it is 30 miles long, andlSbroad. Its 
waters deposit a calcareous sediment ; the shores are tame and uninteresting. Lough JSam, 
a little to the west of this, consists of two lakes joined by a canal ; the first is 20 miles loos, 
and the second 15; they are comparatively narrow. They contain many islands, and tbetr 
shores are pleasant, but not bold ; Lovgh Corrib, on the western coast, is a narrow sheet of 
water, 20 miles, in length. The most noted are the three lakes of Killarney, at the south- 
western extremity of the island. Tbey are small, but very beautiful, and will bear a com^

Eirison with the finest lakea of Ecolland and En^ 
Dd. Their banks are high, and covered witb 
wood ; Dumbers of verdant islands are scattered 
over tbteir surface, and the mountains resound with 
the roar of waterfalls. 

5. Bays. The western coast is the roost deeply 
indented. The largest bays are Galway aad Pone- 

; gaL On the eastern coast, are the bays of Dub- 

I lin and Dundalk. 

6. C/tma(e. The climate is damper ibsn Uiat 
of England, but otherwise similar. Westerly winds 

iMktiffaUmty. are frequent and violent. Snow is rare in winter, 

nd passes rapidly away. Tbe fields bave a green appearance throughout the year. 

7. Soil. A great part of this island is covered with immense bogs, or sterile tracts, pro- 
ducing nothing but beatb-bog myrtle and sedge grass. They form a broad belt across the 
ceoire of the island, widening toward tbe west. Tbe remainder of the soil is stony, but tbe 
moisture of tbe climate preserves tbe herbage, and renders the land e;(,cellent for pasturing. 

8. Geology. A considerable part of tbe surface of Ireland, amounting to 3,000,000 acres, 
it covered by peat bogs to tbe depth of from 5 to 30 feet, which conceal many of iu 
mineral treasures. Tbe island is almost completely surrounded by groups and ranges of 
primary and transition mountains, the inland and central counties being comparatively Iow> 
ud composed of secondary formations. On the northeast side there is also a small extent of 
tipper secondary strata, and nearly tbe whole of Antrim is covered by basaltic rocks. The 
(udor rocks are chiefly mica slates, hornblende slates, and clay slates, with limestone and 
gnuwacke, but granite porphyry and gneiss occur. Copper, lead, and gold are found in 
these districts. Tbe great central secondary district, comprises more than a third part of 
die island, and is often called the Great Limestone Valley of Ireland, because limestone is 
the prevailing substratum. Coal beds abound iu this region. 

9. Minerals. Coal is the most abundant mineral. It is found in Kilkenny, in the south. 
Marble and slate occur in the same quarter. Iron was formerly produced in many parts, but 
â– I present few or no mines are worked. Copper, silver, and gold bare also been found in 
snuil quantities. 

10. Fact of the Country. Tbe surface of Ireland Is almost entirely level. The general 
ippearance of the country is varied and pleasant, although bare of trees. In some parts, are 
neb and fertile plains, and in others, gentle slopes and waving hills. 

Ireland was once covered with forests which are now replaced by immense bogs. These 
forma remarkable feature, cbaract eristic of the country. They afford abundant supplies of 
peat, used by the inhabitants for fuel. From their depths are also taken quantities of wood in 
complete preservation, which indicate, that these bogs are tbe remains of the ancient forests. 
Tbe skins of animals and men that have been swallowed up in them, bave been found con- 
verted into a sort of leather by the tanning matter, which tbe moisture contains.

150 ntGLAND. 

immeDse mass of basaltic columns upon the northeastern coast. This stnpendous' work of 
nature Grst strikes the spectator with the impression, that an eoormous pier or tuole was begun 
upon the beach, the foundations laid and the stones hewn out for building ; but, that ihe work 
was suddenly abandoned. This appearance* has giren rise to its name ; and there is a tradi- 
tion among the natives, that the giants once began to build a causeway across the sea of 
Scotland, but were stopped in their undertaking by the ancient Irish heroes. The causeway 
consists of three piers projecting from the base of a cliff. The pillars are of a dark color, 
and so closely united,^that it is difficult to thrust the blade of a knife between thera. Each 
pillai is a distinct piece of workmanship ; some of them have 9 sides, but the most have 6. 
In some places, the causeway rises into cliffs 350 feet above the sea. 

In the neighborhood) are two singular caverns, which admit the entrance of boats. The 
roofs form almost a regular pointed arch and produce an effect similar to that of a goihic 
aisle. Some of these caverns are formed of rounded stones and others of walls of basalt. 

POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY 

1. Ditirioai. Ireland is'divided into 4 Provinces, Ulster, Leinster, Munster, and Con- 
naught. These are subdivided into 32 counties.* 

2. Canatt. The Ihiblin and Shannon Canal extends from the Liffey at Dutflin, across 
the island to Moy, on the Shannon, 65 miles, 24 of which are across a marsh. The Royal 
Canal extends nearly parallel to this, and is about 10 miles distant from it. The JWwrj 
Canal passes along the southern part of the'county of Down, and is used for the transporta- 
tion of coal. The Ulster Canal is intended to unite Loughs Earn and Leagh, and has but 
recently been projected. A ship canal has also been planned between Dublin and Galway. 

3. CiHei and Tovms. Dublin, the capital of Ireland, is delightfully situated at the bottom of 
a bay on the eastern coast, about a mile from the shore. It is divided by the little river Lifiey 
into two equal parts. The city is nearly square, being about 2\ miles in extent. The houses 

are generally of brick, and the streets irregu- 
lar ; but those that run parallel with the river, 
are, for the most pan, uniform and spacious. 
In the more modem part, they are from 60 to 
90 feet wide. There are several Gne squares, 
one of which, called Stephen's Green, occu- 
pies 27 acres, and has a magnificent appear- 
ance. Sackville Street is one of the finest in 
Europe. No city, in proportion to its size, 
has a greater number of elegant buildings. A 
vast number of country seals and villages are 
scattered over the country in the neighborhood, 
and are displayed in a charming manner by the 
slope of the ground down to the bay. The hi^ 
lands of Wicklow hound the prospect in the 
Dtilim. interior, and render the view in every quarter 

delightful. Yet the stranger will not fail to 
observe, in Dublin, the most painful marks of indigence and distress. Men, women, and chil- 
dren, of all ages, are seen in the streets, partially covered with rags, so loosely attached to each 
other, as to seem on the point of dropping off. Whole streets are filled with wasted mothers, 
bearing in their arms their pallid offspring ; attenuated and gray-haired men, tottering from age 
and want ; and others, bearing m their countenances the evidences of hopeless poverty. The 
suburbs of Dublin are occupied by the hovels of the poor, which are far inferior in cost and 
comfort, to the cow-houses of the United States. Yet there is a quietness and resignation 
about these Irish poor, which, to an American, is astonishing. They sedtn to submit to their 
condition, as if it were their just lot, and cheer their misery with wit and merriment, whenevei 
an opportunity offers.

DiMij has a cODsiderable trade by sea, and the canals, which extend from this pcint to dif- 
ferent parts of the island. The banks of the river are lined with elegant quays, and sfaippitig 
of 300 tons may come up to the lower part of the city. Here are large manufactures of linen, 

CQlion, woolen, and silk. The

ing several hundred vessels ; 
the enormous piers, which de 
fend the harbor from the en- 
croachments of the sea ; the 
custom-house, &c., are among 
the most remarkable structures. 
The hospitals, and other char- 
itable institutions, are numerous 
and well endowed, and there 
are many learned societies. 
Dublin contains S4 churches 
and chapels of the esiablish- 
menl, 26 Roman Catholic 
chapels, and Iddissenting meet- 
ing-bouses. In contrast with 
all this splendor, the miserable 
hovels oi the poor present the 
most painful scenes of fillli, 
poverty, and distress, and the 
beggars are very numerous. 
Population, 333,000. 

Cork, the second city of Ire- 
land, lies upon the Lee, about 
14 miles from the sea ; its har- 
bor, called the Cove, is safe 
and capacious, and is strongly 
fortified. The city is irregu- 
larly built, the bouses are old 
and mean, the streets narrow 
Jfdmti POJmi, Soeteiiu Srui, DutUn. and diriy. Its commerce is 

extensive, and it exports great 
qoutities of salted provisions. Population, 80,000. Cork harbor is the principal naval stf 
lioD for Ireland. 

LiHurick, a ciiy on the Shannon, about 60 miles from its mouth, has a good harbor, and is 
connected, by canals, with Dublin.^ The surrounding country is remarkable for ils fertility 
Limerick carries on an extensive commerce. Population, 48,000. To the southeast of Lim 
erick is Caatul^ the see of the archbishop of Munster, coniainii^ a fine cathedral. 

Btl/aH, in the northeast of Ireland, on a bay of the same name, with a safe and commodious 
btrbor, is a flourishing place. Ils manufactures of linen and cotton, and ils situation, in a re- 
maikably populous and highly cultivated district, give it an active trade. The shipping of the 
pert amounts to 35,000 tons. Population, 75,000. To the southwest of Belfast stands ^r* 
^ugh, once a populous city, the seat of learning, and the metropolis of Ireland, now much re- 
duced. Il is at present, however, the see of the archbishop of Ulster, who is primate of all 
Ireland, and coiUains a fine cathedral and the arc hi episcopal palace. 
Waterford, stands on the Suir, just above its junction with the Barrow. Its harbor is ex-

cettent, and it bas one of the handsomest and finestquays in Â£urope. iTbe citf is Veil buiit, 
and its commerce is extensive and flourishing. Waterford now communicates widi Dablio, 
Limerick, and Cork, by railroads and canals. Population, 38,8d0. In the vicinity ts Wes' 
ford^ a trading town, with 11,000 inhabitants. 

Galwayy on the western coast, is a place of some trade, with 17,000 inhabitants. In the 
vicinity, are 7\tam, the see of the archbishop of Connaught, and Ballinasloe^ noted for its great 
cattle fairs, at which 130,000 sheep, and 40,000 cattle, are sometimes collected. 

Other principal places are Kilkenny^ now reduced from its former importance, with consid- 
erable woolen manufactures, and 19,000 inhabitants ; Drogheda^ a trading town upon the 
Boyne, in the neighborhood of which, James the Second was defeated by William the Third, 
17)365 inhabitants ; Dundulky with linen and muslin manufactures, 11,000 inhabitants ; Mwryj 
Londonderry^ and SligOy places of considerable trade with about 10,000 inhabitants each, and 
FakntUj a villi^e on the sou^west coast, with a good harbor, remarkable as the most western 
in Europe. 

4. Jnanufaehirei. The liaen manufactures have long been the most important branch of 
manufacturing industry in Ireland, but for some years have been on the decline. The cotton 
manufacture has been more recently introduced, and is rapidly increasing. The distilleries of 
Ireland are extensive, and a considerable quantity of whisky is exported. The industry and 
resources of the country have been greatly developed during the last twenty years. 

5. ^gricuUure. Agriculture is very backward. The cultivators are generally not proprie- 
tors of Ahe soil, and studiously avoid any permanent improvement of the land, lest the rent 
should be raised. The Irish are idle, and their implements of husbandry very rude. Wheat 
is not generally cultivated, and what is raised is often inferior. Barley is now common, but 
oats are raised in a tenfold proportion to that of any other grain. The Irish staff of life, bow- 
ever, is another article, which is so extensively cuhivated, as to confer upon this island, the 
name of the ^^ land of potatoes." This root furnishes to the poor the greatest part of their 
sustenance. It is remarkable, that a plant, brought originally from America,' and hardly known 
in Europe a century ago, should now be so universally cultivated in Ireland, and grow in such 

Eerfection there. Even in the United States, this vegetable is called the Irish potato ; this, 
owever, is to distinguish it from the sweet potato of the south. The dairy is the best managed 
part of Irish husbandry. 

6. Commerce. The coasting trade between Great Britain and Ireland is active ; the latter 
receiving from the former almost every sort of manufactured articles, coal, &c., and exporting, 
in return, potatoes, salted and other provisions, butter, corn, linen, spirits, and fish. The 
foreign trade of Ireland is not very extensive, but is on the increase. The shipping amounts 
to 100,000 tons. 

7. Inhabitants* In the eastern part, the people are chiefly of English descent ; in the west, 
the originally Celtish race is less mixed, and in the north, there are many people of Scottish 
descent. The common classes are strongly marked with the national peculiarity of features, 
and by this they are readily recognised in other countries. These classes have little beauty, 
for their indigence exposes them to many physical wants and hardships. This observation, 
however, will not apply to the class in more easy circumstances. The Irish have clearer 
complexions than the Scotch, and they are hardy and strong ; they are rather less in height 
than the English ; the orders are the same as in the rest of the United Kingdom. 

8. Dress. There is no national form of dress, except that of England, and this is some- 
what varied. It consists in a coat of frieze, a waistcoat of the same, a shirt of linen, made at 
home, and breeches, purchasect at the shops, seldom fitting, and never buttoned at the knee. 
Some districts are marked by the color of the frieze. A traveler concludes at once, from the 
common dress, that he is in a country of extreme poverty. The dress is often but a broken 
patchwork of rags, sometimes not entirely hiding the skin ; and children, of neither sex, have 
stockings or shoes ; many of 'these, indeed, go half naked, and some go entirely bare ; shoes 
and stockings are, with many adults, but things of ostentation, worn as in Scotland, at cluiroh. 
On Sunday, few are ill-dressed ; one suit is kept sacred for festivals, at which, there are both 
shining faces and goodly apparel. The men wear their hair long and shaggy, though they dres^ 
better than the women. On holidays, the women wear white frowns and colored petticoats, 
and have a cloak thrown over the arm. Vast quantities of old clothes are imported from Eng- 
land, in every grade of shabbiness. 

9 I^^nguages. The English is the general language, though not always spoken even bj the 



imelligeiA, Mtfaotit some of that weD-kno^ intonattbn, wMch is cafled the bri>^. lb ibe 
soadi and west, the Erse or Gaelic is so genera), that a stranger, ^ho ^notrs only Engliih) 
can neMier communicate nor understand. 

10. BviUing. The bouses, e?en of the rich, a)re far te^ elegant an^ comfortaUe dittn in 
Co^od ; they are square and gloomy edifices. The cabins 6f the poor are as slight protec- 
trms from the^limate as were ever feared in civilized countries. They are without chimneys 
oi floors, and are made of mud and straw, and covered with sods 6r heath ; knlmy bave no 
wiidows, and few have more than a single pane. The door is often but a straw mat. The 
funiture is in keeping with the house, and if there be any besides tbe ci*oekj it is but a chest, 
a beach, a table, and a bed. There is but one room, and this is free, ndt only to any person 
to eiter without knocking, but equally open to ^^ the fowl aiid the brute." The villages often 
consist of whold streets of ihiid cabins. The city of Dnblfn, the centire of Which is hardly 
surpassed m Europe, for the beauty and splendor of its edificies, is ^tutbunded by knisertMe 
hoveh, inferior in comfort to the wigwam or tent of the western savage. 

1 1 . Pood and Drink, ^here is little variety in the fbod of the greater palt of the Irish, 
which consists principally of butterhnlk and potatoes, though in springs there is not always a 
sufficiency even of these, and Ae scarcity oden rises to tt fahiine. A cow is k^l in a)tnost 
every cabin, but neither butter, cheese, nor even poulti'y ah^ eggs, ire ever thought of by the 
common people as articles of food for themselves ; these go to pay rents^ tdtes, find tithes, 
and tbe buttermilk otily is reserved for the proprietors. Ev^ery family has, if n6 other fbmi- 
ture^ at least one capacious article, eailed a erockj or ketde, which is convertible to mauy uses. 
Tbe water is brought home, clothes are washed, potatoes boiled, and tbe harvest of potatoes 
often brought home in the crock. Tbe crock or potato bowl is placed in the middle of the 
floor, and the family gather round it, squatting on their hams to eat ; at least, this is the prac* 
tjce where there are no tables or movable seats. Tbe beggar is as welcome as an inmate of 
tbe cabin, and is never turned from the door ;' isuch inhospiiality, it would be feared, would 
bring a curse upon the cabin. Animal food is seldom tasted, or indeed anything as fbod but 
potatoes, by tbe mass of the people. 

The number of tbe indigent in Ireland, and the degree of misery to which they are often reduced 
for food and other necessaries of life, can hardly be imagined in this country, where fkmine 
never comes, iind where pauperism scarcely exists, except what is created by the improvident 
emigrants from Europe. Many of the towns in New England are without a single pauper, and 
there are but few in the whole United States. But the ^^ Cork Reporter," of a late date, sayS) 
that ^^ in three parishes of that city alone, there have been found no less than 26,000 paupers, 
and the whole city is supposed to present an aggregate of 60,000 persons, without the means 
of providing for themselves. The number of persons who die of mere starvation in a country 
like this, must be considerable. 

The Irish are temperate from necessity, as their poverty seldom permits them to have the 
dignity of denial. Whisky, however, is a constituent part of festivals, and acting on th& ardent 
natioiud temperament, leads to quarrels, Which are called rows. Manv of the hai-d-eamed 
gains are expended for whisky, though the consumption of this is on tne decrease. Up to 
1829, there was a progressive increase in the consumption of spirits in Ireland. In 1830, 
Aere was a decrease, of home made spirits alone, of 210,903 gallons, and in the first half of 
lS.il, a decrease of 721,564 gallons ; while in Scotland, during the same time, the decrease 
was 513,687 gallons. 

12. TVaveling. All that used to be so uncomfortable and ludicrous in Irish posting, has 
disappeared, and in th% frequented parts, the traveler finds good*roads, vehicles, and accom- 
modations. The inns, indeed, are inferior to those in England, and in the more hiimble kinds â€¢ 
it is not unusual to see a sign which promises the traveler " dry lodgings,'* or ** entertainment 
with beds." 

In the remote parts, tbe traveler must shift as he can, and he must sometimes travel on a 
^mall car with very low wheels. Some of these have but a flat bottom, fastened upon tbe 
axletree. The jaunting car, in whith the common people of Dublin take their family excur- 
sions, is a large cart, that will carry a great many people, who sit on two long seats and ride 
sideways. 

13. Character^ Manners^ and Customs, It must be admitted,' that the sway of the British 
government in Ireland has been of a kind to depress the spirit and debase the character of the 
people. It has been thought to be a good measure for the security of the union, to keep the 

20 



1^ ntELAMD. 

Irish ignorant and poor, rather than intell^ent and prosperous. Disabilities, political, citiI, tod 
ecclesiastical, have been imposed upon them, and it is only of late, that they have been in some 
degree emancipated. The country has been divided, and sometimes by the policy of diegor* 
emment, into internal parties, which have committed the most ferocious murders and mas 
sacres. These, however, have been the effects of oppression, acting upon a temperament 
naturally ardent, rather than the outbreak of a character, in itself cruel and ferocious. 

The Irish, then, are ardent, brave, generous, and, to a great degree, faithful to their trusts. 
Of this latter trait, many instances have occurred in the course of die various armed and other 
political associations in which they have been engaged. They are cheerful, and no people will on 
lesdvak so completely throw off all remembrance of care, to enjoy the passing hour. Thej 
are, however, easily offended and prompt to resentment ; duels are not rare among the gentry, 
or less dangerous appeals to force unfrequent among the Ipwer class. The club, under the 
name of a shillalaj is a general accompaniment at fairs, where it is sometimes put to other uses 
than those of a staff. This facility with which the Irish fall into anger, was supposed, by some 
writers, to have supplied the name of their country ; Ireland or Land of Ire. Selfishness, 
however, hardly enters into their composition, and it is so much an Irishman's impulse to give, 
that charity in him is scarcely a virtue. He has indeed litde to bestow, but in times of plenty 
or faroitie, and at all times, the beggar is held to have as good a title to whatever the cabin 
contains, as the master himself. 

An Irishman has great quickness of apprehension, and it appears in nothing more than in 
sudden retorts and repartees. It may almost be affirmed of him, that 

*' He never said a fooluh thin^, 
And never did a wise one." 

The very beggars have a natural eloquence and tact that is irresisdble ; and when solicitation 
fails, they employ no measured degree of sarcasm or imprecation. They have indeed great 
incitement to importunity, for a penny is a provision for a day. Girls and boys will run by the 
side of a stagecoach for half a dozen miles, in the hope of a few halfpence from the passengers. 
In Scotland, it is rare to find an importunate beggar, or in Ireland one of any other description. 

To a stranger, the common Irish are obliging and civil, and in this respect are different 
from the same class in England. Nothing can be more rude and insolent than the boys and 
men of the lower class in the latter country. In Ireland you can hardly ask a favor within 
the power of an individual, that is not cheerfully granted. An Irishman is loquacious and has 
sometimes a strange confusion of speech, or a sort of transposition of ideas, known as a bvU, 
He speaks as he acts, upon the first impulse, and begins to express a thought the moment it 
strikes him, and sometimes before he understands what it is. His mind is a mirror, and his 
speech discloses all the figures, whether distinct or confused, that pass before it. He gener- 
ally answers a question, not like a New England man, by asking another, but by repeating it. 
When a traveler inquires for post horses, he will get this reply ; '^ Is it post horses you are 
asking for ? we have." The Irish are a people of great humor and wit, and Steele, Gold- 
smith, Farquhar, Sheridan, Curran, Grattan, and Swift were natives of Ireland. 

The domestic affections are strong in the Irish, and there is not in the whole island, so 
much desertion of parents by children, or of children by parents, as there is evidence of in 
England, within the walls of one poor-house. Orphans are distributed among the cabins, 
where there is little distinction made between them and the children of the family. There is 
litde reverence or affection in the lower class, towards the gentry, and the Irish peasant, unlike 
the English, will seldom sakite on the road, one of the higher orders ; where many of the 
landlords are absentees, there can be little kindly feeline between theAi and the tenants ; and 
the leases are often held by middle men, who underlet the lands to those who cultivate them. 
Though many of the leases are sufficiently long for the advantage of the cultivators, there are 
few who will make improvements. In the general esumation, a slight advantage to day over- 
balances a greater one that may accrue to-morrow. Of course, under such discouragements, 
the Irish are not greatly inclined to agricultural labor, and they take every advantage of the 
holidays in which the Romish church is so liberal. A traveler asked one of the considerable 
tenants why he made no improvements, and received the general answer, " Sure I've only 21 
years' lase, and 9 years of it gone, and to make the ground better, would be raising the rinr 
on myself, and I wish to kape the bit of ground at the rint for the childer any how." Ireland 
is the country of expedients ; the remedy for bad fences is to tie together the legs of quadru- 



poo 
Tb( 



mtlLAND. 155 

peds, with ropes of straw ; two goats i^e as inseparably yoked as Chang and Eng, and even 
fowls are fettered. A sheep is connected by a running ring to a rope, which is tied to two 
stakes, and removed when the pasturage is consumed. The higher orders of the Irish *are 
distinguished for hospitality and frankness. They are much given to convivial pleasures, and 
one of' the most favorite employments is that of a wine merchant. Our remarks, however, on 
the Irish character, are chiefly drawn from those who make by far the greatest class. The 
Irishman who would advance his fortunes must pass beyond the limits of his country ; and 
those of his country are found high in station in every nation in Europe. The qualities* that 
depress him at home, elevate him abroad. In the northern and northeastern portions of the 
island, the inhabitants are chiefly of Scottish descent ; they are Protestants ; many of them 
belong to the Church of England, and others are Presbyterians. There is little difference of 
character between these and the people of Scotland. 

14. â€¢Amusements. The Irish are a very cheerful people, and dancing is the favorite national 
amusement. There is no assemblage of the common people without a dance, and few are so 

K>r as not to entertain a dancing-master, whose charges, however, are exceedin^y low. 

be athletic exercises which are general in England, are many of them common in Ireland 
Sunday is the day which is most devoted to amusements among the Catholics ; and two baronie? 
or counties will sometimes have their champions for hurling stones, or pitching bars. The Sun- 
day cake never fails in its attractions. This is a huge cake, purchased by subscription, anti 
placed on a distaff, in a field near an alehouse ; and it is the prize of the best dancer, or arch- 
est wag, of the company. The piper is a necessary part ot the festival, and he is seated on 
the ground, with a hole dug before, in which he receives the presents. 

15. Education. The condition of the Irish has been much improved, with regard to the 
advantages of education, though there is much to be done before they will be as well educated 
as the people of Scotland. In 1825, there were 1,702 schools, though, since then, the number 
has much mcreased. More than 1.300 were founded by the Hibernian Society, which was 
formed at London. The Protestant Society has upwards of 500 schools, and the Christian 
Brotherhood 24. These are kept by men who throw all they have into a common stock, and 
devote themselves to celibacy, and the education of the poor, to which they bind themselves 
by a vow. There are 46 female schools connected with nunneries, besides which there are 
350 day schools supported by subscription, and many Sunday schools. There is a Roman 
Catholic college at Maynooth and Carlow, and a Jesuit college at Clongows. There is but 
ODe university ; this is at Dublin, it has about 400 students, and is an institution of very high 
character. 

il6. State of the Arts. The arts are not in a flourishing state in Ireland, principally from 
the want of the encouragement that the residence of the rich proprietors would give. The 
useful arts are fa^ lower than in England or Scotland, and the ornamental ones are little culti- 
vated^ A taste for music is common, and no man is more welcome in an Irish house than a 
piper or a harper. Many of the old national airs are sweet, but they are not so widely spread 
as those of Scotland. 

Ireland has contributed her full share to the literature and sciences of the United Kingdom, 
and there are no names more celebrated than Burke, Swift, Goldsmith, Sheridan, and Moore. 
The great national bent of genius seems to be towards wit and eloquence, and this appears not 
oolj in the distinguished men, but in the mass of people ; for the very beggars pursue their 
vocation with a union of these two qualities that is often irresistible. 

17. Reliptmy Sit. ^The general religion is the Catholic, though the established church ts 
that of England. The Catholics of Ireland are therefore taxecf for the support of two hier- 
archies. Four fifths of the inhabitants are Catholics, and the other fifth is composed princi- 
pally of Episcopaliarj^ Presbyterians, Methodists^ and Baptists. The established church has 4 
archbigboprics, and 18 bishoprics ; attached to which are 670,000 acres of land. The income 
of the church is about 5,000,000 dollars. Provision has lately been made by the Imperial 
Parliament for the diminution of this enormous abuse, by the gradual abolition of 2 archbish- 
oprics, and 8 bishoprics, thus leaving 2 of th^ former and 10 of the latter. This arrangement 
is to take place on the death of the incumbents, and is already partially effected. Only one 
oiDth of the population belongs to the established church. There are 27 Catholic archbishops 
and Bishops, 1,500 parish priests, 3,000 curates, and 984 benefices, averaging 6,000 souls, 
fn every parish there is a chapel. The established church is chiefly supported by the pay- 
Dteot of a composition for tithes, and the Catholic church by contributions and fees for mar* 



nages, burials, massas, &c. The Irish pay their own clergy wilfioglj) Init they look um 
the mooey which goes to the English clergy, as cruel exlortiou. The last cow and the W 
pig- are often forced away by the officer to satisfy (be demand of an English der^roan, whose 
floctrines they disbelieve, and from whom they receive nothing but evil. The Catholic 
religion and the Catholic clergy afford them their 4>est comforts and consolations ; while the 
Protestant religion is made to bring upon them their greatest sufferings. It is but natural, that 
thev should cling to the first, and hate the hst. The Catholic clergy are exceedingly zealou$, 
ana live on terms of familiarity with th'^ir flocks. They advise them on worldly affairs, and 
generally act as their lawyers. The churches have few pictures or images. The stipend of 
a priest is about Â£ 150 a year. The fee for a marriage is from 5f. to a guinea ; for a chris* 
tening, from 28, to half a crown ; for visiting the sick If., and for buriak and masses, from 2i 
to several pounds.

18. Funerals. The funerals of the common Irbh are peculiar. They are preceded by a 
tfofte, where the friends sit up all night with the corpse, eating and drinking, as if on an 0â‚¬ca< 
siun of festivity. Female mourners are paid for the ulalulu, or howling at die burial ; a cus- 
tom which is common in some eastern countries. XM^y address questions to the corpse, as 
^^ Why did you die, or why did you leave us ? " The processions are long and clamorous. 
Many who walk in Uiem are covered with long blue cloaks. 

19. Oovemment. Ireland is still denominated a distinct kingdom, but it is governed by a 
viceroy appointed by the king, called Lord-Lieutenant of Ireland. There is also an Irish 
chancellor, a secretary of state, a commander of the forces, and attomev-general. The island 
was incorporated with the kingdom of Great Britain, in 1800. There is now no separate pa^ 
liament, but Ireland is represented by 32 peers and 105 members of the House of Commons, 
in the parliament of Great Britain. The citizens of Ireland are entitled to the same privileges 
with those of England, in all matters of commerce and provisions under treaties. By the cadh 
olic emancipation bill, certain restraints and disabilities are removed. This bill was passed in 
the year 1829, and by it, all catholics are eligible to all offices of state, except the Chancellor- 
ship, the Lord-Lieutenancy of Ireland, the Regency of the United Kingdom, and the High 
Commission of the church of Scotland. Catholics are still excluded from the right of present- 
mg to a church living. Connected with the emancipation bill, was another law, which disfran- 
chised the 40 shilling freeholders, and raised the qualification of electors to an mcome of 10 
pounds from real estate. By the reform act, the elective franchise was extended to persons 
occupying a tenement of ten pounds' yearly value, and to copyholders, and some other tenants, 
but the number of electors is small. 

20. Bank. There is a national bank at Dublin, called the Bank of Ireland^ with a capital 
of 3 millions sterling. Its profits arise from a trade in bullion, and the discounting of bills of 
exchange. It is under the superintendence of a governor, deputy governor, and 15 directors, 
all chosen yearly. 

21. Laws. Generally, the laws are the same with those of England. There are, however, 
no poor laws, and the indigent have no aid but from charity ; Ireland is, therefore, the country 
for mendicity. 

22. Antiquities. In the north of Ireland, are several of the round towers, that are found in 
Scotland ; but there are few architectural or other antiquities in the island. 

23. History. The history of Ireland has been the theme of much discussion and dispute. 
It has been contended, that the island was colonized by the Phoenicians, who brought hither 
their religion ; and it is maintained, with some plausibility, that the round towers, and other 
monuments, with certain manners and customs, still lingering among the Irish, bearing an ori- 
eotal cast, are witnesses of the fact. The traditions of the people, seem also to support the 
theory. It is certain, that the island was known, and was populous, several hundred years be- 
fore Christ. The first inhabitants were doubdess Celts, and the Celtic stock still maintains 
the ascendancy in the country. Ireland presents, in the native tongue of its living inhabitants 



QtBLAMD. l$if 

tht purest specimeD, and, indeed, the only tolerably pure example, of the language of the 
Cdts, in^ile the people are the lineal descendants of the nrst settlers of Europe. These facts 
Â«e to be accounted for, from the spirit of independence, which has ever characterized the 
people, and which prevented even the Roman Empire, that swallowed up the other portions 
of Europe, ftom settins the foot of her soldiery on Irish soil. 

The annalists of IrcSand, carry back their history to Kimboath, who reigned 200 years be- 
fore Christ From this period, down to the times of authentic history, they furnish a regular 
saeeession of kings. These, however, are, many of them, apocryphal. St. Patrick, who 
was &8t made a c^tive on the Continent, and carried to Ireland, effected his escape, and hav- 
ing been appointed to that service by the See of Rome, returned in 432, for the express pur- 
pose of Cbnstianizing the people. He found them governed as they had been for centuries, by 
several petty kings, generally acknowledging one principal sovereign. The Saint ad- 
dressed bunself to them, as well as to the druidical priests, and in 30 years, by his zeal, dis- 
cretion, and piety, Christianity was spread over the whole island. 

The ancient system of government was still continued, and though monasteries rose up, 
which, in the 7th and 8th centuries, became the seats of learnings and shone with considerable 
brilliancy, while the rest of Europe was shrouded in darkness ; -^ still, there was no great im- 
provement in the condition of the people. In the 9th century, the country was overrun by 
the Danes, who harassed the people for 200 years. They were at length defeated in the 11 th 
centurj, by the celebrated Bnan Borohm, and soon after expelled. But the country had been 
so weakened by its northern invaders, that Henry the Second, of England, made an easy con- 
quest of a portion of the island in 1172. From this period, England has claimed the sove- 
reigity of Uie country, though for three centuries her dominion was scarcely more than nom- 
inal ; and even down to the present day, the mass of the people continue to be opposed to 
British sway. Ireland, having been treated as a conquered country, the hostility of the peo- 
ple has been kept alive ; and while they were too numerous and too independent to be easilv 
held in this state of subjection, it seems that measures of the utmost severity have been uni- 
formly adopted by the British governmeut. The country has, therefore, been often excited to 
rebellion, during which the most shocking scenes have been exhibited. As examples of the 
sufferioes of this unhappy country, it may be stated, that in Cromwell's time, all the posses- 
sions of the Catholics were confiscated, 20,000 of the people were sold as slaves in America, 
nri 40,000 entered into foreign service. After the battle of the Boyne, 1689, which restored 
the protestant ascendancy. King William proscribed the adherents ^f James the Second, and 
ooonscated therr estates to the amount of millions. Great numbers of the Irish entered foreign 
senrice, and it has been computed, that from 1691 to 1745, nearly half a million fell in foreign 
servfce* 

In 17S2, a short respite from these measures of tyranny was granted to Ireland. The Irish 
pvliament was then placed on the same footing as is that of England. Under these circum- 
slaaces, Dublio became^ a centre of attraction, and the gentry, instead of living in England, 
now resided on their estates. The effect of this state of things was magical. The country 
rose from its state of depression with astonishing rapidity, and Ireland began to display the 
resQorces of the country, as well as the genius of the people. But this happy prospect was 
soon eclipsed. A rebellion broke out in 1798, which being suppressed, Ireland was united to' 
tbe British crown, in 1801. Since that pmod, there has been an almost constant succession 
of rebellions, and riots, â€” either excited by the oppression of government, or the starvation of the 
people. Within a very few years, some alleviation has been granted, by the removal of the 
CattMfic disabilities, but the Irish people, at home, and those who' seek their fortunes in other 
lands, seem destined to beair that heaviest of burdens, â€” the conviction, that their country is 
the victim of tyranny

CHAPTER VI. XV. FRANCF.. 



.4 Sirta n ParU. 
PHYSICAL GEOORAPHT. 

1. Bovndaries and Extent. France is bouoded north by the English Channel and tbs 
Netherlands ; east by Germany, Switzerland, and Italy ; south by the Mediterranean and 
Spain ; and west by the Atlantic, or rather an open gun called the Bey of Biscay. Froei 
Switzerland, Italy, and Spain, it is separated by mountains. It extends from 42Â° Sty to 51Â° 
N. laiimde ; and from 18Â° Â£. to 5Â° W. longitude. Its greatest length from north to south is 
590 miles, and its breadth is about the same. It contains 205,000 square miles. 

2. MoutUaim. The Cevenna form the central chain. They rise in the south, on the vest 
of the Rhone, and extend northerly between that river and the Ln're. They diverge mto 
various branches easterly and westerly. About the head streams of the Loire, west of the 
main chain, is a branch called the Puy de Dome, which contains some extinct volcanoes. 
The southern branch is called the CanitJ, and between these are the Montt d'Or, the highest 
mounlains in France. These branches are called the mountains of Auvergne. The highest 
point is the Puy de Sansi, 6,330 feet above the level of the sea, which approaches within 98 
feet of the height of Mount Washington in New Hampshire. This group of mountains covers 
an extent of 120 miles, and is composed chiefly of basaltic rocks. In winter they are espos- 
ed to dreadful hurricanes of snow, which 611 up the ravines and confino the inhabitants to their 
bouses. Sometimes comniunicBiloDs throughout a neighborhood are effected by means of 
long arches under the vast masses of snow. In summer, thunder-storms with torrents of bail 
are frequent. On the eastern borders of France are the Vosgti, a chain of low and rounded 
elevations running north and south. They are covered with rich pastures, and on the south- 
ern and eastern slope with vines. They abound in minerals, and one of the valleys affords â–  
precious green granite. The highest summit of these mountains is 4,530 feet. On the bor- 
ders of Switzerland is a range called the Jura ; and further south are the ^lp3, which sepaiate 
France from Switzerland and [taly ; some of them are granitic, and others calcareous. 

In the south are the Pyrenea, separating France from Spain. They run nearly east and 
west, and the western extremity of the range extends into Spain. They will be described in 
itifl chapter on that country. 



S. Vatteys. Tbe valley of the Garonne is formed by the Pyrenees on the south, the 
Cevennes on the east, and the Cantal and some other ranges on the north. The valley of 
the Rhone b formed by tbe Jura on the north, the Alps on the east, and the Cevennes on the 
west. The valley of the Loire is bounded by the Cevennes on the north and west, and by 
the Cantal and Monts d'Or on the south. The valley of the Seine is bounded by a branch of 
the Cevennes on the south, and a range of chalky hills on the north. 

4. Rivers. France is a well watered country. It is computed, that ii contains 6,000 
rivers, 300 of which are navigable. In the north is the Setne, flowing northwesterly into the 
English Channel at Havre. It is 450 miles in length. Its borders for the most part are 
exceedingly fertile and beautiful. It flows by Paris, but is not navigable for large vessels up 
to this city. The Loire is the longest river of France, and has a course of 600 miles. It 
rises among the Cevennes and flows north and west into the Bay of Biscay. It is navigable ' 
by boats to within 90 miles of its source. Between Angers and Nantes it is one of. the finest 
rivers in tbe world, with a wide current, woody islands, and bold and cultivated shores. Its 
depth is from 7 to 10 feet. The alluvial deposits form shoals at its mouth which are contin- 
ually increasing. 

The Garonne rises in the Pyrenees within the limits of Catalonia, and runs northwesterly 
into the Bay of Biscay. Its course is 350 miles. Near the sea it is joined by the Dordogne 
from the east, and the united stream is called the Gironde. Its mouth is full of shoals. Bor- 
deaux stands upon the Garonne, just above the junction with the Dordogne ; and Toulouse 
is on the upper part of its course. Between these cities it is navigated by tbe largest boats, 
and from Bordeaux to the sea by ships. The tide flows nearly 90 miles up tbe stream ; and 
is sometimes preceded by a huge billow, that sweeps destructively along the shore. The 
scenery between Toulouse and Bordeaux is beautiful ; the river passes through extensive 
plains of luxuriant fertility. Tbe land about its mouth is rocky and barren. 

Tbe jRAone, for swiftness and depth, is distinguished among the rivers of France. It rises 
from a glacier on the western side of Mount St. Gothard in Switzerland. It flows 100 miles 
in that country to the lake of Geneva, through which it passes westerly into France. At 
Lyons it is joined by the Saone from the north, and the united streams under the name of 
the Rhone, flow south of the Mediterranean ; it joins the sea bv two principal mouths. Only 
small vessels enter by the western channel ; the eastern is deeper, but on account of the 
swiftness of the current, the navigation up the river is difficult. The entire course of the 
Rhone is 500 miles. Its waters are of a light blue. From Lyons to Avignon, a distance 
of 140 miles by the course of the river, the banks of the Rhone are extremely picturesque, 
winding among rocks and moimtains, and oflfering to the eye a romantic and perpetually vary- 
ing scenery. Between Lyons and Vienne, are seen forests, vineyards, chateaux on com- 
manding eminences, and cottdges embosomed in trees, retiring from the view ; these, with the 
busy traffic on the majestic river, and the prosperous villages along its banks, aflfbrd an en- 
chanting spectacle to the eye of the traveler. The Saone which flows into the Rhone below 
Lyons, is so tranquil, that it is difficult to perceive which way the current sets. The swift 
current of the Rhone refuses to mingle with the Saone for some time after their junction, and 
a distinct line of separation can be seen between them for many miles. The Isere and Dur- 
OQce rise among the mountains of Savoy, and flowing westerly fall into the Rhone. The 
Samme flows into the English Channel ; the Charente and Mour into the Bay of Biscay. 

The Escaid or Scheldty the Meusey and the Moselk rise in the northern part of France and 
pass into Belgium. The Rhine washes a small portion of the eastern boundary. 

5. Lakes. There are no lakes that deserve the name in France. Near the coast of the 
Mediterranean, are some shallow ponds or etangSy in which salt is manufactured. 

C. blands. The island of Corsica^ in the Mediterranean, forms a part of the kingdom of 
France. It is about 100 miles from tbe French coast. It is 116 miles long, and about 59 
in width. It is mountainous, and one elevation rises to the height of 9,346 feet. At a distance, 
the island has the appearance of an enormous pyramid of mountains. Fertile vales lie among 
the ridges in every part. The slopes are covered with forests of oak and fir, and they contain 
rich silver mines, with iron, copper, lead, antimony, alum, marble, porphyry, and Jasper. 
Tbe soil produces wine and olives. The inhabitants amount to 185,000. Bastia, the 
largest town, has 9,316. Ajaccio, on the western coast, was the birth-place of Napoleon. 
The land in Corsica is mostly public property. The commerce consists chiefly in tbe expor- 
latioD of coral, which abounds on tbe coasts. A narrow strait on tbe south divides this island 



isa niiivcii 



ftom fluK^ott* The mam Imid of Imlj is widuo 5Q miles of the northern part. In the Baj 
of Biscay, are the isles of JMrmouHerj O^fron, R6j and BeUei^y which are productive ia 
wine, ikhantj or OmstasU^ Urs off the nordiwestera extremity of France, and is the most 
western spot in Eurcupe occupied by the French. 

7. Bays and Gulfs* The Bay qf BUeay is ^n open gulf on the west, formed by the 
coasts of France and Spain, On the coast of the Mediterranean is the Gulf of Lions^* so 
s^led in the middle ages from the frequent tempests which occurred there. The Gulf of SL 
liaUh, in the English Channel, contains the islands of Guernsey, Jersey, and Sark. 

8. Shores and Capes, Two large, promontories lie on the northwestern coast. That of 
La Bogus projects into the English Channel, and that of Raz forms the westernmost point of 
France. The coasts rise gently from the sea, and in some places exhibit high cliffs. In thh 
southern part of the Bay of Biscay, the coast is flat and sandy. 

9. CHnuUt. The air of the northern part is moists and there are considerable snows and 
sharp frost in winter. At Paris, the Seine is frequently frozen so as to admit of skating. In 
ihe central parts, no sn9w falls, sometimes for many years ; frosts seldom occur, and the air 
IS pure, light, and elastic. The harvests begin from the latter part of June to the middle of 
July. The soaith of France, from the Loire to the Mediterranean, is subject to violent storms 
of hail and rain, which destroy the crops. One tenth of the produce, upon an average, is 
yearly damaged bv these storms. Thunder-storms are frequent and violent ; they produce cat- 
aracts, which rush down the mountains, burying the meadows under heaps of stone and masses 
of mud, and cutting the sides of the mountains into deep ravines. In most parts of France, 
frosts are common late in the spring and early in autumn, which do great injury to vegetation. 
The high country of Auvergne is bleak and cold, and all the districts of the Vosges are affected 
by the snow, which sometimes continues to fall upon these mountains as late as the end of June. 

In the southern provinces, the summer is exceedingly hot. The vintage is in September. 
At the end of autumn, violent rains fall ; but October and November are the pleasantest 
months in the year. In December, January, and February, the weather is fine ; but after Feb- 
ruary, a strong northeasterly wind, called the Mistral^ blows, sometimes with snow, but gener- 
ally with a clear sky. It is sometimes so violent upon the mountains as to blow a man off his 
horse. At Avignon, the olive-trees are frequently killed by it. The south of France may 
be characterized as possessing a mild and salubrious elimate. Montpellier, on the shore of the 
Mediterranean, is celebrated for the purity of its air. 

10. Soil. France is generally a fertile country, but the soil varies much in different prov- 
inces. The northeast is the richest part ; there are admirable com districts along the Seine, 
Rhine, and Moselle. The hills of Champagne and Burgundy produce the most excellent 
vines. The valley of the Oaronne has a warmer soil, but it is less productive than that of the 
northern districts. â€¢ 

11. Geology. The Cevennes are composed of granitic rocks, supporting basalt. Granite 
also constitutes the foundation of most of the other mountains. Some parts of the Alps are 
calcareous. Chalk formations are common in the north. Gypsum is abundant in the country 
around Paris, and from this city it has received its popular name. 

12. MiUural Productions. The common forest trees are oak, birch, elm, ash, and beech. 
Forests of pine and fir extend along the Atlantic coast, and upon the Vosges and Jura moun- 
tains. The only fruit-trees indigenous to the country are, the fig, apple, pear, and plum. 
The cherry-tree and vine were brought from the East by the Romans. The Greek colonies 
on the shores of the Mediterranean transported thither the olive, a native of Mount Taurus, in 
Asia. The orange, lemon, and white mulberry were brought from China, the black mulberry 
from Asia Minor, the apricot from Armenia, the peach from Persia, the almond, walnut, and 
melon from different parts of Asia, and the pomegranate from Africa. 

13. Minerals. Coal is abundant, but the beds lie at a dbtance from the sea, and are little 
worked. There were formerly many copper mines, but they are now chiefly abandoned. 
There is a gold mine, unwrought, in the eastern part. Lead is found in Brittany, and manganese 
abounds in sufficient quantities to supply the whole of Europe. Silver, iron, cobalt, nickel, 
cinnabar, and arsenic are sometimes found. Among the stones and earths are the hyacinth^ 
emerald, beryl, tourmaline, amethyst, chalcedony, and turquois, porcelain earth, chalk, marUC) 
and gypsum.

14. JffiMtW Springi. There are bo less than 940 mineral springs m France. Tfaose of 
Aix> ID the south, were known to the Romans ; they contain sulphur, lime, and sah. At 
Bagoeres, are several warm springs. The greater part of the mineral springs are i:inder the 
superintendence of physicians appointed by government. Accommodations for the sick are 
provided at 151 of them. There are salt springs in the Department of Jura, from vrhich salt 
IS manufactured. 

15. Animab. Bears are numerous in the Pyrenees, and in the Alpine districts ; and comÂ« 
mit frequent ravages among the corn-fields. Wolves and wild boars are found in the forests, 
in various parts. The ibex and chamois inhabit the Alps and Pyrenees. The fox, otter, 
wildcat, martin, squirrel, and beaver, are known in different districts ; scorpions are common 
in the southern provinces. 

16. Face of the Country. France generally exhibits a level, but not undi versified surface. 
The most level tracts are in the north. The picturesque beauty of the hilly parts is heightened 
bv the rich and luxuriant verdure of the chestnut-trees. In the south, the deep hue of tne 
olive gives rather a sombre look to the landscape. From the mouth of the Garonne to the 
border of Spain, the coast consists of a flat, sandy, barren tract, called the Landes^ extending 
20 miles into the country, and producing nothing but heath, broom, and juniper. The remain^ 
der of the country is, in general, agreeably diversified with gentle undulations.

3. Canah. Thera are 86 caDals in France, baviog a total length of 3,350 milei ; onlf Ai 
principal can be mentioned here. The Canal of Languedoc extends from the Garonne, netr 
Toulouse, to Cette, on the Mediterranean, which it thus connects with the Atlantic. It is 143 
miles in length, 60 feet wide, and 6 deep, and passes through the bill of Malpas, by a tuanel 
720 Teel long. The Canal of the Centre^ or the CharollaU Canal, conoectfl the Loire with 
the Saone, al Chalons, and is 72 miles in length. The Canalo/J/otuieur connects the SaoiM 
with the Rhine, at Strasburg, passing by Dole, Besan^on, Montbeliard, and Muhlhauseo, with 
a branch to Bale ; total length, 215 miles. The Canal of Burgundy, 150 miles in leDgth, 
CM>nnects the Yonne, a tributary of the Seine, with the Seone, passing by Dijon, and thtn 
forms a communication between the English Channel and the Mediterranean. The Brian 
Canal connects the Loire, at Briare, with the Seine, passing by Moniareis ; length, 67 irilei, 
the Orleani Canal, which terminates near that town, and connects tbe Loire with the Brian 
Canal, may be considered a branch of the latter ; it is 45 miles long. The Canal of Brittany 
extends from Nantes to Brest, a distance of 230 miles. The Si. Qtunfin Canal connects tbe 
Oise, at Chauny, with the Scheldt, at Cambray, passing by St. Quentin ; length, 58 miles. 
The Somme Canal connects, tbe last mentioned with the Channel, passing by Ham, FeroDne, 
and Amiens, in the valley of the Somme, and terminating at St. Valery, at the moutb of tbil 

3, Tomif. Paris, the capital of France, and the second city of Europe, in point of pop- 
ulation, stands upon both sides of the Seine, having a circuit of about 15 miles, and contaioing 
a million inhabitants. It is upwards of 200 miles 
from the mouth of the Seine by the course of the

I mouth, by the post roads. The environs do not 
present tbe same variety of gardens, parks, and 
' villas, as (hose of London, nor is the stream of 
life in the -great streets, the crowd of carriages, 
horsemen, wagons, and foot passengers, so great 
as in the neighborhood of the Briiish capital. But 
it may be considered the capital of tbe world for 
tbe sciences, arts, and politeness. It is enclosed 
by a wall 17 miles in circuit, and is more closely 
built and inhabited than London. Surveyed from 
a central point, it presents a form nearly circular, 
with the river flowing through it. In tbe river are 
^"^^ 3 small islands, one of which, in the time of Julius 

Ctesar, was inhabited by a tribe of barbarians, called Paritii, and from them the city, nhlcb 
praduatly grew up around their collages of clay and straw, received its name. By the Romans, 
It was called Lutetia, and the Emperor Julian made it his residence. Clovis made it the seat 
of his court ; it was enlarged by many of the French Kings, and Napoleon added those vast 
improvements and embellishments which render it the admiration of every visiter.* 

The eastern part is the most ancient, and most irregularly built ; here the streets are narrow

â– ad crooked. The western part is modem and well built. Tbe Boulevards constitute a wide 
nmll, witb four raws of trees pai,sing in an irregular course around ihe central part of the city ; 
ihey occupy the site of the ancient walls of Paris, rendered useless by the growing up of (be 
city irouod them and are two miles in extent. There is nothing in Paris more striking tban 
the Boulevards. The exterior Boulevard is a broad street on tbe outer side of the wall 
wDtcb encircles the city. But a small portion of this is built upon. The Boulevard most fre- 
quenlly mentioned, is in ihe midst of the city. Different pans of this are called by difierent 
niQies, as tbe Boulevard des Italiens, from its vicinity to the Italian opera, Boulevard du 
Temple, Ilc. It is impassible lo convey an adequate idea of the liveliness of the Italian Bou- 
levB^d at night. Multitudes of gayly dressed people are sauntering through it, while parties of 
both sexes are sitting beneath the trees, sipping coffee, lemonade, and liqueuri. The air it 
filled with music, and ilic niagnilicent buildings on either side are lighted as if for an illumina- 
tion. In any other riiy, a scene like this would have something of bustle in it, but the Pa- 
risians live in public, and while they are always cheerful, they have seldom a busy air. They 
pass to and fro, as if contented and bappy, and manifest little excitement, except by tbeit am 
)nisied conversation. To an American, this place wears the aspect of enchantment. 

The Champ de Mars Is an oblong park bordered by rows of trees, and extending from the 
Military School to tbe river ; it is tbe spot commonly appropriated to the reviews of troops 

and great public festivities. The 
gardens of the Tuileries, to tbe west 
of the palace, are elegantly laid out 
with graveled walks, terraces, plola 
of flowers, shrubs, groves of trees, 
and basins of water, interspersed 
with beautiful statues in bronze and 
marble. These are I be favorite 
walks of tbe Parisians, and on Sun- 
days, they resort hither in crowds. 
The Luxuinbourg gardens, in tbe 
southerly part of the city, also af- 
ford beautiful walks. The Champs 
Elysees form a spacious common 
in the western part, and tbe entrance 
to the city in this quarter is one of 
the finest avenues in the world. 
Oat^itMart. Walks are laid out in various parta 

of these fields, and superb national 
fetes are given here, on which oc- 
casions tbe trees are brilliantly il- 
luminated. The subjoined cut 
represents tbe appearance of this 
spot in winter. The finest square 
in Paris is the Place Vendome, in 
the centre of which stands a col- 
umn erected by Napoleon, in 
commemoration of the Austerliti 
campaign ; it is covered with bas- 
reliefs in bronze, made from tbe 
cannon taken in the campaign. 
The banks of the Seine are beau- 
tified with noble quays, and the 
stream is crossed by 16 bridges, 
12 of which are of stone, and 2 of

A great number of elcgaol founiains adon 
Bod purify tbe streets and oiarketa. Ad 
immense fountain, in tbe sbape of ao ele- 
pbaot, in bronze, was begun by Napoleoa 
on tbe spot occupied by the Bastile, but 
atiU remains unfinished. 

The church. of Notre Dame is a noble 
gotbic edifice, 390 feet in leagih, with tow- 
ers S04 feet high. It was 200 years in 
building, and was finished about tbe yeu 
1200. It stands in the most aocieni part 
of Paris, on tbe island in the Seiae, called 
la citi. The church of St. Generieve is 
DOW called tbe Faniheon, and is designed 
as a mausoleum for ibe ashes of celebrated 
men ; it is a magnificent edifice in the mod- 
ern style. Tbe Hospital of Invalids is aa 
immense building, designed for tbe residence of 
disabled soldiers. It is surmounted by a splen- 
did gilt dome, which alone was 30 years in 
building, and is esteemed one of the roaster- 
pieces of French architecture. 

The. Jardin des Flames is the noblest collec- 
tion of interesting objects in Natural History, 
that has ever been formed. Tbe public build- 
ings in Paris, which deserve notice for their size 
and magnificence, are too numerous even to be 
mentioned here. In this respect, Paris is far 
above London. The Tuileries form an exiea- 
sive and somewhat irregular pile, nearly one 
fifth of a mile in front, which has a noble effect. 
The Louvre is a model of symmetry, and is 
thought to make the neaiest approach to perfec- 
tion of any modem building. It contains 1,000 
paintings, 1,500 statues, and 20,000 dratrings. 
Here the whole population of Paris are admitted 
on Sundays, and it is thought, that ilie refined 
and polished manners of the Parisians are in a 
great degree owing to the familiar contemplation 
of these masterpieces of art. The Palare of 
the Luxemhourg is chaste and elegant, but less 
striking than the Tuileries. The 
Palais Royal, in the busiest part of tbe 
city, is an immense quadrangle, sur- 
rounding an open garden or court, and 
constiluies a grand assemblage of shops, 
galleries, coffee-houses, and saloons, 
m a siyle of magnificence that aston- 
ishes a stranger. In these brilliant 
purlieus, the visiter will find, com- 
bined with the utmost elegance and 
taste, whatever man has been able to 
invent for the saiisfsciion of his lux- 
ury and pleasure. Here fashion has 
established her empire, and here she 
reignsoverParis,France,8ncl the whole 
civilized world. Here are crowded 
together, merchandise of every kind,

<iit mbest Btiiffi, tbe most pracioos trinkets, and every prOductroo of the arts. A geDeral 
tntoiicaiiofi of pleasure may be said to prevail in this enclosure of luxuries, which is the con- 
lUnl resort of strangers always flocking to Paris . It is the centre of trade, the focus of wealth, 
business, idleness, festivity, literature, the arts, and of every species of industry, talent, and 
diasipiiiOD. The world has nothing elsewhere like it. The Bourse, or Exchange, is the 
hindsomest building of the kind in Europe. 

Tbe libraries of Paris are very large, and formed upon the most liberal principles. Most 
of ibem are pubhc, and accessible at all times to the rich and poor. Tbe Royal Library cofr- 
Iiias above 500,000 volumes, besides 80,000 manuscripts, 100,000 medals, many hundreds 

of iliousands of tracts, and 1,000,000 
engravings. This library is crowded 
consiandy by persons of all classes, in 
pursuit of knowledge. The other libra- 
ries have from 150,000 volumes down- 
ward. 

There are about 30 theatres, lai^e 
and small, in Paris. All the theatres 
in France pay a tenth part of their re- 
ceipls to the poor. The houses in the 
older parts of Paris are very high. Tbe 
streets are generally without side-walks; 
and some are paved with flat stonesj. 
Alt those parts without the Boulevards 
are called jauxbourgt. The gates of lhÂ« 
city are denominated barrieri, and here 
passengers must exhibit tbeir passports, 
and merchandise pay a duty on enter- 
ing the city.* 

The most famous of tbe ceme- 
teries, is that called Pere La Chaise 
(Father La Chaise) , from the name 
of a priest, to whom the ground 
formerly belonged. It is prettily 
laid out, with shaded walks, adorn- 
ed with flowers, and contains many 
handsome monuments. 

The manufactures of Paris are 
various and extensive. The book 
trade and priming business exceed 
those of any other city in the world.

ciiy were obtaiaed ; but about 50 years ago, tbe bones of ten geoeratioas were collected, from 
the different churches and burying-grounds of tbe capital, into these carems, and the remuM

5. Cirmmeree. Much of the foreign commerce of France is transacted by foreign vessels, 
and tbe amount of shipping is much less than that of the United States. The annual value of 
imports is about 100,000,000 dollars, consisting chiefly of raw materials for mnnuractures, and 
of natural productions for food ; the value of the exports is a Utile less, consisting principally 
of manufactured articles, wines, brandies, &c. The coasting trade and internal commerce 
between tlte different re|ions of this rich country, are extensive.

9. Mitional Debt. This amounted in 1829 to 821 million dollars, but was increased b; 
the Revolution of 1830, and is now about 1,000 millions. In 1797, it was 4,440,000,000 
dollars. Two thirds of this sum were annihilated by a decree of the revolutionary govero- 
inent, and subsequently two thirds of the remainder. The public funds consist of bank sbarei 
and the tiers consolidi^ a 5 per cent, stock. 



* Rouen is the Manchester of France, and its proximity 
to Havre de Grace, the great American port, ^ives it the 
same advantage in point of situation, that Manchester 
derives from the neifirhborhood of Liverpool. Tlie cotton 
trade of Rouen supports from 56 to 60,000 persons. The 
corduroy and velveteen of Troyes are well suited for la- 
borers* clothing. Caen produces cambric muslins, equal 
to those of Switzerland. Tho (ginghams from the Upper 
Rhine are stout and well dyed ; and the printed muslins 
of Versailles rival those of England. The delicacy and 
perfection of the French cambrics have long been unri- 
valed. The French laces are made both of silk and thread. 
The point lace of Alen^on and Argentan has long enjoy- 
ed a great name. The parchment made in France is 
esteemed the best in Europe. In clocks and watches the 
Parisians are rivaling the Swiss. The manufacture of 
surgical and mathematical instruments, and of all sorts of 
expensive and tasteful toys, are carried to high perfection. 
The porcelain of Sevres has a great reputation. The 
f Itas manafactare of St. Qobin retains its high preemi- 



nence for large and beautlAil mirrors. The crystal mm* 
ufactnries in and about Paris are very numerous. Fivnch 
furniture is cheaper than English. Dyeing is carried on 
largely in the neighborhood of the several cloth maou- 
factories. The waters of the Saone are excellent ftr 
scouring, and possess a soapy quality. Those of tbi 
Rhone are pure and equally fitted for dyeinff. The sape- 
rior excellence of the French cloth as re^ds color, ariicf 
in a ^eat measure from the great purity of the waters 
used in dyeing. The raw cotton spun in France in 1895 
amounted to (3,993,2X0 pounds. The wool to I02,900,fl00 
pounds. There were 3.000 cashmere shawls, and 41,000 
woolen shawls exported the same year. The value of 
the silk annually worked up is equal to 26,640,000 doUais 
of American money ; more than one half the raw mate- 
rial is of native production. The China silkworm has 
long been naturalixed in France, and the French whits 
crapes now rival those of the East, so long inimitable in 
briHiance and puritv. Red and blue embroidered stuA 
have recently been iai]fely exported to Persia and Tiirksy

to. JBink. The Btok of Fnmce was establisbed in its present form in 1801, with a cap* 
ml of 30,000,000 francs. Its dividend has always exceeded 5 per cent. Its notes are not 
a legal tender, and nearly all its business is transacted in gold and silver. It is strictly t 
public institution, and the chief officer is appointed by the government. It is a bank of dis- 
count, deposit, and circulation, but none of its notes are lower than 500 francs. Private 
bankers in France do not issue notes. 

11. Army and JVavy.* In 1838, the Budget exhibited the number of troops at 300,000 
men. According to the same document, the French navy consists of 49 ships of the tine ; 
62 frigates ; 31 corvettes ; 49 brigs ; and above 130 smaller vessels, including 21 steamboats. 
There is a royal marine college at Angouleme, a marine school at Brest, and several schools 
of navigation. 

12. Population. According to the official estimates for 1837, the total population of 
France, including Corsica, was 33,600,000. Two thirds of this number are engaged in 
agriculture, and about half the remaining third are mechanics. The French empire in 1812, 
previous to the Russian campaign, comprised a population of 43,000,000. France has en- 
tirely recovered from the losses occasioned by the wars of the Revolution and the Empire, 
fod was never so populous as at present. It contained by the census of 1846, 35,400,000. 

13. InhabitanUy ClasseSy &c. The principal part of tne inhabitants are descended from the 
Celts or Gauls, the Romans, and the Franks, but chiefly from the latter. The Bretons who are 
mostly in Lower Brittany, are the descendants of the people who were driven from England by 
the Anglo Saxons, in the 6fth century. -After a lapse of so many centuries, they are still distin- 
guished from the French in dress, customs, and language. The German inhabitants of France 
are in part Walloons, and live for the most part in Alsace, and a part of Lorraine. The 
Basques are descended from the ancient Cantabrians, and dwell at the foot of the Pyrenees. 
The remainder of the inhabitants are Jews ; Gypsies, who lead a settled life on the Rhine and 
Moselle, and Savoyards who wander over the country. The French are a well formed and 
active people. In complexion they are not so clear as the English, and they are less robust 
in frame ; though there are many who would be considered corpulent even in England. Id 
the southern provinces, the skin is darker, and the eye more restless and brilliant. 

Hereditary peerage in France is abolished. The titles of nobility are princes, dukes, mar- 
qiBses, counts, viscounts, and barons. There were formerly no less than 36,500 noble fami- 
lies, though of these only 4,120 were of the ancient nobility. The most ancient order is that 
of St. Michael, founded by Louis the Eleventh, and conferred on distinguished artists and sa- 
vans. The order of the Holy Ghost, is like the last, limited to 100 chevaliers, and it includes 
the royal family and the princes of the blood. Louis the Fourteenth established the Order of 
St. Louis, as a reward for military services. Under the consulate^ the Legion d'Honneur 
was instituted, and the members were both military and civil. At the Restoration it was 
reoi^anized. It has 80 grand crosses, 160 grand officers, 400 commanders, 2,000 officers, 
and an unlimited number of chevaliers. There are three schools for the education of 900 of 
the daughters of the members. 

14. Dress, France has long been looked up to as the standard from which there is no ap* 
peal, in all matters of taste or fashion, whether as regards dress or cookery ; and it must be 
owned, that the French have earned their reputation in this respect by the unremitting atten- 
tion, which they have bestowed upon these subjects. From the highest to the lowest indi- 
vidual, from the duchess to the grisette, there is a universal, and, it would seem, an intuitive 
esfrii de eoquetterie^ which in no way displays itself more forcibly than in the frequent and 
tasteful arrangement of the toilet. The ^^ Courrier des Dames," and the ^'Journal des 
Modes," have carried their laws through every part of the civilized world. In all the great 
cities, whether of Europe or America, the dress of the upper classes is an intended imitation, 



* Tbe moantJUD party orifirinated the military oonscnp- 
tkm. Caniot, tbe revolutionary minister at war, or- 
mmiaed to 1794 no leaa than 14 armies, amounting to 
1^00,000 men. The decree of conscription was declared 
a permanent law of the repablic, and afterwards of the 
emptrp, and this en^ne whether wielded by a Gamot 
m A Napoleon, Uke the lever of Archimedes, for a time 
â– uved and overtuined the balance of the political world. 
The annual conscription after the incorporation of Bel- 
fioB and tlie Italian States with the empire, averaged 
firm 1806 to 1810, 360,000 men. By the official report 



of January, 1809, the French army consisted of 900,000 
infantry, and 100,000 cavalry, wiUiout including auziU 
iaries. It was aiflerwards still more augmented. In 
1812 and 1813, France called out by extraordinary con 
scriptions in her own territories, 1,280,000 men; and 
firom other countries 700,000, making a total of 1,960,000. 
In the beginning of 1812, when Napoleon had reached 
the pinnacle of his greatness, he had a standing army of 
1,200,000 men, a force greater than Rome ever 
in the senith of her power. 



173 I^AANCE. 

diough often a caricature, of Parisian costume ; and now, ibat these arbiters of fashion have 
carried their arms into the African deserts, it is probable, that the Arab maidens, layinp; aside 
the white veil with its tinkling bells, will begin to sigh for blouses^ and cashmeres, and Chao- 
tilly lace, and chapeaux de gaze artophane. It is certain, that an innovation has already taken 
place in the dress of the Algerine fair, since the entry of the French heroes into their capital, 
and that upwards of 50 ladies were persuaded to attend a ball given by their conquerors, with 
the novel incumbrance of shoes and stockings. 

Every event of importance, sad or glorious, a war, a revolution, or the downfall of a dynasty, 
IS immortalized in France by a pat6 or a riband. When the Opera House in the Palais 
Royal was burnt down, in 1781, the fire of which lasted for more than a week, and in which many 
persons perished, the Parisian elegantes displayed dresses of a flame color, entitled ^^coukwt 
feu de V Opera ! ^^ The modistes find it advantageous to give a singular name to a color. 
<^ Couleur giraffe ^^ had a meaning in it ; but the exact ^^ coukur d^araignee meditantune 
crime," which was for some weeks the rage in Paris, could only have been imagined by tbe 
fantastic brain of a French modiste. After the fall of Robespierre, the surviving victims of 
bis tyranny, being released from their dungeons, resolved to celebrate the tyrant'; death after a 
truly French fashion, viz. by giving a ball. No one could be admitted who could not prove 
that he or she had lost a friend or relative in the late massacres. It was entitled the '^ frol dts 
tric/tmw." The rooms were hung with red drapery, and the dresses were couleur de sang. 
History does not record, that any steps faltered among those who partook of this strange fes- 
tivity ; that the pas de bourries were performed with less grace than usual, or the pas de vaUs 
with less vivacity. It is related, that two ladies, who had been united by the sentimental bonds 
of female friendship, each of whom had believed the other to be among the victims of tbe 
guillotine, and who had both obtained their tickets of admission upon this unfounded report, 
met in the ball-room, to their mutual surprise. They rushed into each other's arms ; when 
the director observed, that they had lost their right to remain, and they were requested to with- 
draw. Their joy was suddenly checked. ** It is charming to recover one's friend," said one 
of the ladies, sighing deeply ; " but â€” it is sad to lose so excellent a ball." 

Fashion, in France, is a despot whose laws are blindly obeyed. For each season there is 
a costume, and a deviation from the mode is looked upon as the violation of a moral duty. 
Indeed, a sin against etiquette is more severely visited than a sin against propriety. If the 
offender is a foreigner, a civil contempt is expressed by that inefl^able shrug, which can only be 
executed by a French shoulder. Times are by no means altered since the days of Madame 
de Genlis, when a devoted lover broke off his engagement with a lady, from making the dis- 
covery, that her shawl, which he had firmly and fondly believed to be a real cashmere, was a 
peau de lapin. When the peace, that followed the restoration of the Bourbons, permitted tbe 
English to visit Paris, the English ladies, in their short waists and poke bonnets, excited as 
much consternation as the appearance of a tribe of South Sea Islanders, in their skins, would 
have caused to a less sensitive nation. Les Anglaises pour rite was an amusing CHricature of 
English dress and manners, as they acted upon the risible nerves of the French nation at that 
period. Upon one occasion, when crowds had assembled according to custom, to see Louis 
the Eighteenth feed in public, a titter suddenly arose among the well-bred mob, gradually in- 
creasing, and terminating in a burst of laughter, such as had never before invaded the precincts 
of the royal ear. The cause was hastily inquired into, and a sufiicient apology for mirth was 
discovered in the unexpected appearance of an English poke bonnet. 

The ladies in the country, and in the provincial towns, follow the Paris fashions, and are 
.more or less well-dressed, according to their facilities of communication with the capita). 
During the Bonaparte dynasty, Madame le Roi, the couturiere of the Empress Maria Louisa, 
presided over the empire of taste. But long waists were restored with the Bourbons, and Na* 

f)oleon and Madame le Roi fell together. Victorine became the legitimate sempstress, and 
ong reigned without a rival. The morning dishabille of a French lady is the perfection of co- 
!|uetry or of slovenliness, according to her intention of being visible or otherwise. If the 
ormer, her peignor^ or white muslin dressing-gown, is arranged with scrupulous neatness. 
Her morning cap is simple, but becoming ; and, down to tbe points of her red slippers, the 
nicest eye can discover no fault. If the reverse, there is more ease than elegance in her toi- 
let, and tbe hour of promenade in the Tuileries finds her exhibiting a personiGcation of the 
grub transformed into a butterfly. Great judgment is displayed by a Parisian lady in her 
choice of a seat in these gardens, where the sun shall throw a becoming shade over her coultwr

4Â»^ ro$e btt. The same regard for her complexion ioduces ber to fit up her boudoir with t 
suitable color, accordiug as she is a blonde or a brunette. One superlatiye merit must be 
panted to the French ladies ; their toilet is the perfection of simplicity. The dress of 
an Â£ng^sh or American lady would furnish materials for that of half a dozen moderate French 
women. 

Xbus far we have been speaking of female dress. The French gentlemen, instead of at* 
tempting to give the law in dress, rather affect the English fashions. The imitation, however, 
runs ioto caricature, and while the English gentlemen are the best dressed men in the world, the 
Freocb are almost the worst. But it is not among the higher classes alone, that dress is con- 
sidered a matter of importance in France. Every station has its peculiar costume. The wife 
of a shopkeeper, or a milliner's girl, wears a dress equally distinct from that of a peasant or of 
1 lady. It generally consists of a chintz or stuff gown, a colored yic/iii, black-silk apron, and 
s cap of a fixed form, ocnamented with lace and ribands. A bonnet is considered as the exclu- 
sive privilege of a lady, and no severity of weather would induce a Frenchwoman to depart 
from this rule. The' peasants in the different departments of France have a costume peculiar 
to themselves. The most remarkable variety is in that of the women in Upper Normandy, 
where the eauchaiit cap is worn. It is made of starched muslin, and is from half a yard to a yard 
in height. It stands up nearly perpendicularly, and is ornamented with long lace lappets, called 
coquilUs. The hair is braided in front, and gathered up in a mass behind. Upon a young and 
handsome woman, these hieh caps have a pretty effect. They are called CauchciseSj mar 
moitesj and Pierrots^ accordmg to the height and form. The rest of the dress consists of a 
bright scarlet petticoat, extremely short, a black jacket, called an Jlpollofiy and a colored apron; 
long gold ear-rings, and gold hearts and crosses, fastened either to a black velvet riband or gold 
chain. In the town of Bolbec, the greatest luxury is frequently displayed by the peasant 
women on Sundays and fete days ; not only in the lace and ornaments of the cauchoise cap, but 
in their gold trinkets, which are frequently of no mean value. In Lower Normandy, the 
peasants' dress is nearly the same, with the exception of the cap, which is low and flat in 
the crown. 

In the other departments, there are different varieties of costume ; and in some places, such 
as the neighborhood of Lyons, the peasant women wear a flat, round, black hat, either of cloth 
or velvet, and not unlike those worn in some parts of Switzerland. The men are dressed 
prettj much as the laboring classes in England, or the United States. The village dandy is 
shaved and curled on Sundays and holidays, and at other times, usually wears a blouse of blue 
stuff, like a wagoner's frock, buckled in at the waist, and embroidered in white at the wrists 
and collar. 

15. Language. Two dialects grew out of the corruption of Latin ; which language was 
introduced by the Roman conquest ; the Southern one was called the Langue d^Ocy and the 
Northern, the Langue d^Oil, The former, though much changed, is still the language of Pro- 
vence, Languedoc, Catalonia, Valencia, Majorca, Minorca, and Sardinia. The literature of 
this language, is principally in the songs of the Troubadours, which were chiefly confined to 
the two great themes of chivalry ; love, and war. The modern French, is derived from the 
Langue d'OiU and it is so well adapted to elegance and social life, that it has long been the 
language of courts, diplomacy, and the higher classes in many countries. A knowledge of h 
wiU carry a traveler over all civilized Europe. Besides the French, and the Proven9al Ian* 
goages, the Bretons have their ancient British tongue, and the Germans have a corrupted Ger- 
raao. The French, however, is general, in all the towns. 

16. Manner of Building, In France, are some of the most magnificent edifices in the 

world, but these are principally in the cities, for a country life is seldom led by the wealthy. 

The great power of the kings, before the Revolution, and of Napoleon, since, enabled them to 

expend large sums in buildings, and other public monuments. The Revolution dispersed many 

of the rich landed proprietors, and the class of rich merchants and manufacturers reside chiefly 

iu a>wns. There are, therefore, few elegant and commodious country houses in France, com- 

pared with the number in England. The old chateaux are gloomy and without taste ; but the 

cottages are generally substantial and comfortable. They are thatched, and have windows and 

chimneys ; the floors are of clay, beaten bard. In some parts, the houses are of mud, mixed 

with straw, which is cut into large square pieces, and hardened by drying. A house of this 

knd is sometimes of three stories, and has window frames of stone. The pise is a common 

raade of btiilding, and it is a process by which all kinds of earth, except sand, are compressed 



17* ftlANCtf. 

and hardened, f hey are kid in mortar, like stones. The cottages Lave, invariably, a garden, 
and they are often ornamented with flowers. 

17. Food and Drink. French . cookery is known throughout the world, and is unrivaled in 
variety and delicacy. The expedients are innumerable for giving various flavors to the same 
material, and it frequently requires a scientific palate to discover the original nature of this ma- 
terial, under its various disguises. Monsieur Grimod de la Reytiiere observes, in his jI/dm- 
nach de$ Gourmands^ ^^ There are, in France, 685 ways of dressing an egg, without counting 
the new methods, which our savans imagine daily." At the Hotel of this gentleman, a weekly 
meeting used to be held, called the Jury Degustateur, where new sauces and dishes were sulh 
mitted for their inspection, and sentence pronounced upon their merits. A French chefdt m- 
' iine^ is considered an indispensable appendage in the establishment of a person of fortune in 
Europe ; and the salary given to ariisteSy frequently exceeds that bestowed upon the private 
tutor, or governess of the family. The names of Very and Beauvilliers, the famous French 
Restaurateurs, are well known. The brother of Very, who was also a proficient in the art of 
cookery, has a magnificent tomb in the Cimetiere Montmartre, with a pompous inscription, 
concluding with these words : TotUe $a vieftU consacree aux aris utiles. The Caf(Â§ Hardy, in 
Paris, is famous for the excellence of its dejeuners k la fourchette, where CoUlettes d^ognecu 
au points d^asperge^ Rognons saute a la vin de champagne^ &c., may be had in perfection; 
with Beaune, Chambertin, cofiee, parfait amoury and all the necessary ingredients of a French 
breakfast. 

The pates defoiegrasy made chiefly at Toulouse, and Strasburg, are a celebrated article of 
French cookery, and the cruel process by which the liver of the geese is enlarged, in order to 
produce this renowned dish, is thus described in the Cours Gastronomique : ^^ The geese are 
plucked, placed before a slow fire, and fed for several days. Heat and captivity produce an 
enlargement of the liver, which renders them peculiarly, excellent." A stranger, visiting Pans, 
finds some difficulty in seeing his way through a Restaurateur's cartey and in choosing between 
the Pates de Perigordy the Thou marine (pickled tunny), a fish which is taken chiefly in the 
Gulf of Lions, the Poulet a la MarengOy Langue de baujd la sauce piquantey pates a lafinasr 
ctere, JinguUUs a la Tartarsy Tranches de Bceufaux Tomatesy ^c, ^c.y SfC. If he is a John 
Bull, his national taste may be gratified by observing Bifstek aux pommes de terrcy Bifstek au 
moutony or mutton-chop, and Rosbifd VAnglaisCy among these varieties. 

Frogs are esteemed a great delicacy. It is the legs and thighs only, of the animal, which 
are dressed, and the flavor is somewhat like that of boiled chicken. They are caught in the 
frog*ponds in the provinces, and sent up to Paris, where a dish of frogs is reckoned a rarity, 
and is expensive in proportion. A dish made entirely of the combs of the domestic cock, is 
also often served up. Tortoni's celebrated cafe gtacierCy on the Italian Botilevard, is well 
known to all who have visited Paris, as a fashionable lounge, where the topics of the day are 
discussed, over grappes a la jardiniere and ponche a la glace. Notwithstanding the imporunce 
attached to cookery in France, there is no country in the world, where economy in that deÂ« 
partment is so well understood, and so universally practised. 

The proportion of animal food consumed there, is much less than in England. The climate 
IS milder in France ; there is a variety of delicious fruits, and the wines are cheap and invigo- 
rating. Nothing can exceed the moderation and temperance of the laboring classes, in their 
food. Bread, fruit, eggs, milk, coffee, and vegetables, form their chief subsistence. Even 
among the better classes of farmers, animal food is scarcely ever in use, except on Sundays. 
Their dinner generally consists of omelets, or vegetable soup ; pottage of onions, sorrel, or 
cabbages. . It is not uncommon to see a family of French children assembled to dinger, round 
a dish of cherries, a loaf of bread, and a jug of water ; or a woman, who has labored all day 
in the fields, dining upon an apple and a slice of bread. In the vintage provinces of France, 
where the climate is good, this temperance probably conduces to the health of the peasantry ; 
but on the sea-coast, and marshy lands, where shaking fever and ague are very prevalent^ these 
maladies are attributed by the physician, in a great degree, to the extreme poorness of the 
living. 

The French are temperate ; and with a cheerful temperament, with wines of great variety 
and excellence, and with the best of brandies and liquors, it is, still, seldom that a person 
is seen intoxicated. The brandies are unrivaled, and they are generally made wherever the 
wine is produced, though the best are at Nantz, Cognac, and Poitou. In the cities, beer is 
much used, and it is made in France of an exceUent quality. Where the grape does not flour*

â– b cider h Uuie, md ibera is nonfl superior to that of Normandy. But France is the country of 
tbe grape ; tlie product of the vineyards is delicious, and so Bbundanl, that it supplies the denrand 
of every less fortunate climtie. The choicest ivines, however, seldom pass the frontiers. The 
Champ^ne is a sparkling wine, and the best is not to he had for less than 6 or 6 francs a bottle; 
md this quality is in too much demand to be easily obtained. The Champagne river vines 
â– re generally red, and the mountain wines white. Those of Sillery are the most esteemed. 
Some of the choice Burgundy has been sold on the spot for 12 francs a bottle. The wines of 
Bui^ndy are both red and white ; they are light and delicious, both in taste and perfume. 
Tbe best are those raised in the departments of the Cote d'Or, Yonne, Saone, and Loire. 
Some of the red wines are tbe Chamhertin, Ronianee Conti, Ricbebourg, Roraaoee de St. 
Vivant, Tache, and St. George. The Mont Rachet is a white wine of great celebrity. The 
Hennilage is a delicious red wine, produced on (he Rhone. 

Among tbe clarets, tbe La Fitie, the Latour, the Chateau Margaux, and Haut Brion, are 
M^d for about 35 per cent, more than the common qualities ; and even at Bordeaux, a bottle 
of ihe best of these is not to be had for less than 6 francs. These are the wines that are tbe 
most known and esteemed. Tbe common m du payi, or country wine, is of various quali- 
iie>, and great quantities of it are consumed. The bare names of all the various wines of 
Fraoce, would hardly be coutaiaed in one of these pages. There are more than 350 different 
kinds. It is estimated, tbat about one twenty-sixth part of tbe territory is taken up in the cul- 
tiralion of the vine. Tbe price of vineyard land is very high. An arpent, or rather more 
than an Eogliab acre, which produces 800 bottles, is sometimes sold for 3,000 dollars. It is 
mdoubtedly true, that tbe people of countries abounding in wines are far more temperate than 
those who cannot cultivate ibe grape. All the inventions of man to supply the want of wines 
ire deleteriqus. It has been contended, tbat wine is everywhere an evil, yet we believe it may 
be safely stated, that, in the country of vineyards, it is seldom perverted to a curse. But, 
when it becomes an article of commerce, it is mixed, adulterated, and dashed with spirits, 
lor better preservation. In the United States, a deleterious manufacture of wines is carried 
on to a great extent ; and the use of this poisoned beverage is often tbe beginning of intem- 
perance, which is tbe less suspected, because the enemy comes in the seeming guise of a 
friend. 

18. Diteaxtt. France is, in general, a salubrious country, and there are few diseases of a ' 
Didignaot type. Tbe plague has been imported at Marseilles, where it made fearful ravages ; 
but perhaps the most common of the local diseases is the fever and ague, which prevails in 
many places. 

19. IVaeeitR^. There is less internal communication in France than in Eiigland. Tbe 
method of posting extends over France, as well as Europe generally. Tbe postmasters are 
appointed by the government, and furnish horses and carriages st a moment's warning. Tbe 
postilion, by certain notes of. his horn, gives notice to the post-houses ; and when the traveler 
arrives, tbe horses are in readiness. This mode of traveling is expensive ; and the rale is about 
6 miles an hour. The diligence is a cheaper and a much slower method. The Diligence, 
tbe Dame of which promises litde speed, is someihing between a wagon and a coach ; its stops 

are brief, and it goes from 4 to 6 miles an hour. 
There are usually 5 horses. One is within a heavy 
pair of shafts, another is harnessed without the shaft, 
at the side of the first, and three are leaderr harnessed 
with ropes, abreast. The postilion is himself a char- 
acter. He wears a little round, hat, a green jacket, 
hair en queue, and jack-boots, thai may well be called 
enormous. Tbe nature of his equipments calls upon 
j}gf~â€žft. '''â„¢ ^Â°' perpetual expedients, ana he seems to be al- 

ways joining a bridle, knotting a whip, or knocking on 
a saddle with a sUme. He is off and on his horse's back many times in a stage, without stop- 
ping the vehicle. If a passenger calls, he dismounts, pops his head into the window, or runs 
Of tbe side. Tbe diligence has a conductor, who ^eeps in the cabriolet, or forward apart- 
neat, and who sits at the head of the table with tbe passengers. 

Some of tbe great roads of France ore paved with stone, in a very superior manner. They 
were made in times when tbe peasantry were compelled to labor upon them, and many arÂ« 
Afeded with rows of venerable trees. Yet they are far less agreeable to travel npon than the

English Mactdftmiwd ronda. They seem tAmost deserted, aod even Ae greet ireewÂ»dM

roods, generally) are ia a wretched state, aod the practicable ooes not more thao oDe-tlard d 
the extent of those o( Eogland. The cross roads are few aod neglected. Where tbete ii 
little iDternal circulation or traveling, the inns must be of a humble clasa, and those of Ffwu 
are distioguiabed for the general want of accomniodations. In England, there is scarcdji 
village so remote, ibai an excellent inn is not supported by travelers, social parties, snd cific 
feasts ; but there are in France many considerable towns without an inn that would be deoned 
tolerable in an English village, and in the 
hamlets the traveler will fare still worse. 

In the province of Landes,* ia Grscodj, 
there is a singular mode of traveling ; bi the 
district is very sandy, the shepherds ud 
country people walk on stilts, by which tbey 
are elevated from 3 to 5 feet. This is t 
strange sight, when a man is so distant, that i 
spectator cannot see the stilts, as it seems 
that ha is walking in the air. The people go 
in this way, 8 or 10 miles an hour, witbcnt 
much fatigue. The stilts are long poles, vitb 
a projection for the foot to rest on ; they an 
strapped at the knee and at the ancle. By 
means of a polei which they always cany, the 
walkers can let themselves dowq, take ai^* 
thing from the ground, and recover their 
standing position. 

30. Charaeler, Mamurt, &c. An Ame^ 
ican in France who has previously known ths 
French only from descriptions by the Eng- 
lish, is forcibly struck with its unfairoesi ; 
ibe descriptioa in many points has not die 
resemblance even of a caricature. It seems 
to be the instinct of the English to hate lbs 
French, and this accounts sufficiently for tfas 
calumny. Goldsmith hit not only upon tbe 
English feeling, but he exemplified the ni- 
(ionat fairness, in making one of his charK- 
lers say, *' I hate the Freocb, because the; 
are slaves, and wear wooden shoes."

f f ^ Mvj Aovf^ it is not like that of the Â£n|^ish, persowd, but national ; the dignity of the indi- 
Wdual vanisfaes before the glory of France. Glory is the passion of the French, and if tbe 
national honor be advanced, a private or even a public calamity is little heeded.. This passtM 
ttt glory has had ample grat^cation, though at a tremendous sacrifice of human life. Napo- 
leon owed bis devation to this passion in the French and to his power of ministering to iti 
graftificadon ; he gave them glory, and they bartered freedom. 

The Freoch are more sensible lo the impressions of joy than of sorrow ; they foel the good 
and forget tbe evil. The present outweighs tbe Aiture, and the existing impulse is the tÂ«itiog 
OBO ; tUs is die instability which the English call insincerity. This also produces a locifiiy 
Â«f iidaptatioo to drcumstances, thaC enables them to bear reverses better than any other peopIO) 
Odd that makes them (eel at home, wherever they are ; in courts, or camps, or amoqg the 
oAdeit nvage tribes* It is noiod in America^ that the French settler in the forest^ sooner 
I any other European, beeomes identified with the Indian. Tbe nattnral cheerless ^ 
Fr^Mdi is Bostdned by a general urbanity, that exists b no other country ; their politeness 
I is both a feding and a habit, and it is a better guard of social order than an armed police. 
Tkore can be few quarreb and little cdomny, wbere there is no offence ; and pugilism, whMl 
is in England bM to be so necessary foe eelf-defence, would seldom be called into acuon in 
France. 

Tbe forms as well as the spirit of politeness pervade all classes, and a laborer has as high 
a sense of what is due in this way from him to bis equal, as a nobleman can have of what is 
doe to and from hb peer. Beggars take ofil* their hats to salute each other, and if two porters 
jostle each other in the street, the first impulse of each is to beg the other's pardon ; whereas 
ra England a similar rencontre would give occasion for at least hard words. This universal 
civility, or regard to the feelings of others, is seldom ridiculed by any but the English, who 
ve^ naturally undervalue what they do not possess themselves. 

The cheerfulness of the French is not faK>isterous, or occasional ; it is constant, and con- 
nected with great kindness of feeling. There is so little separation of families, that the man- 
ner of life seems almost patriarchal, and several generations often live under the same roof, as 
at La Grange. It is a common and a delightful sight to behold the whole family group from 
youth to age, come out and enjoy themselves on some holiday or fete. The very terms by 
which these address each other show a mingled simplicity and kindness of heart. The grand- 
sire is called le bon'papa^ or the good father, and the grandmother la bonne matnan. The wife 
speaks of her husband as notre marij ^' our husband " ; the children are called peiitj or petite^ 
and tbe maidservant is known only as la bonne. Wherever the French congregate, there is 
a spirit of enjoyment spread over them ; there is joy and Lnimation in every iace. Wrangling 
or intoxication, that are so often seen in an English or an American concourse, are almost 
unknown in France. Dancing is as much the expression of joy as weeping is of grief, and a 
traveler cannot go far in France without beholding a village dance, to which, as there are no 
refreshments, the national cheerfulness is the only incentive. In other countries it is not 
conmion to see the aged even sitting to behold the dances of the young ; they are too unin- 
terested in pastime to be present ; but in France the aged have scarcely less vivacity than the 
youthful ; and the grandfather, surrounded by his offspring.

This social disposition has raised conversation to the dignity of an art. Gemus and wit ore 
better titles than nobility, and those who have neither, may successfully oidtivate their poMrers 
of conversation, till tbey become good raconteurs^ or relate of stories. A soiri^ is nol 
esteemed like an English rout according to the number of visiters who cannot find seats, but 
occonding to the actnal social enjoyment, and the lively conversation ; the best talkers, there- 
fore, are not the least welcome. It is said, that a lady of rank a&er a death in her eociid 
cifole, exclaimed on meeting a friend, ^^ Alas, Madam ! I have sufiered a severe loss." The 
oibtr thinking it could be little less than a husband, was about to condole with her, when tbo 
beronred continued, ^^ I have lost my best â€” ^ talker,'' ^cumevr.) The French ladioa 
carry this art of conversation to a point littk short of fascination. Animation or enthusiasm

iÂ» D0Vflr checked ; the expressioD of no emotioo is suppressed, aad the rCMce is m mch 
trained and modulated in talking, as in singing. Napoleon feared the salons of Paris nxin 
than the aroiies of his enemies. He knew the taste and talents of the French for epigrams, 
of which he dreaded to become the object, as he was aware of the influence of ridicule om 
his subjects. It must be allowed, that these Parisian squibs are sufficiently pointed and poised 
to wound, but they are more generally political than personal. There is much satire, but little 
calumny. 

In France, the condition of females is peculiar. In the fields ihey labor, and perhaps even 
more than in England, with the men ; but it is not the toil of compulsion, or poverty. Thejr 
â– re allowed to feel at least an equal interest in all matters of properly, and in many cases, tbej 
have the entire management ; the shops, the cafes, &.c., of Paris, are under the charge or 
females, and in these, their realms, the husband Is little more than a subject. The salique law, 
that regulates the succession of the crown, has no force in the shops, or salons. In Freach 
society, woman is placed on an elevated pedestal, and if, by reason of her good sense, she ii 
not spoUed, it is not because flattery is not oflered,.and incense burned. The boudoir is tbe 
sanctuary of a married dame, and the husband, who should enter it unbiddeo, would regard hb 
power more than his character ; he would bear the reproach of society, and be deemed a bnile; 
for it is a great evil, in French society, that the unmarried females have too little freedom, aiiil 
the married, quite too much. The boudoir is a fit retreat for the graces, and other females of 
tbe mythology. Paiotings, statue^, vases, and flowers, nature and art, combine to adorn it. 
It is the palace of Armida, tbe bower of Calypso ; but it breathes of Helicon less than of 
Papbos. 



PnÂ»A P*ttMmtry, 

It is the character and condition of the most numerous ciess, that has the greatest influence 
open a country ; and in France, the peasantry are ^ruly a respectable body. They conslitun 
I great majority of the people, and their condition has been exceedingly improved by the Re* 
TtJulion. The abrogation of all feudal service, which was severely exacted, is alone of vast 
advantage. The corvee compel]^ the peasant not only to labor on roads and bridges, but to 
do other service, to which lillle pay was attached, at the bidding of his feudal lord- With tin 
dissolution of the monasteries, and the confiscation of the property of the emigrants, then 
came a division of lands, that enabled the peasants to become landholders. They were aUow- 
ed 5 rears, in which to pay for the land, and they were permilled lo purchase in the smallest 
qnantities. This circumsUace abne has vastly improved their characters. It has given iboa

ah independ^ce, Witbotit wbieh, no virtue is secure. Tbej have many comforts, and porer^ 
is seldom so extreme among them, as to harden the heart, or depress the spirits. They are 
tknost uorversally above want. 

There is a cow to every cottage, and as there is little pasturage, it is the employment of the 
family, on part of the Sabbath, to go forth, and cut grass in the woods, and the way-side. 
Every cottage has its grande ehambrej where all the articles of finery are bestowed. A high 
and neat bed is indispensable ; this is well furnished with curtains, and mounted by steps. At 
the head are the relics, the image of the Virgin, and there is generally a clock. The garden 
produces a variety of flowers, for which there is a national taste. In the season, everybody 
has a boquet, and children stand ready to toss bunches of flowers into the passing coaches, with 
the 'good wish of ^^ bon voyage." Fontenay-aux-Roses had the privilege of supplying the 
court and the parliament with roses. The peers and magistrates, in their assembly, in May, 
received a bunch of flowers, in which the roses were arranged according to the rank of the 
individual. 

It is unsafe to draw general or sweeping conclusions, in writing of national character. We 
are too apt to forget, that the substance of all character is the same, and that the accidents only 
differ. Individuals of the same nation, difier much more, than the general character of two 
nations. The difllsrence of language, manners, and dress, is so apparent to the senses, that it 
is often extended to other points, in which there is no dissimilarity. It would be well for our 
species, could there be, in one nation, a union of what is estimable in the English character, 
with what is amiable in the French ; that the asperities of the one, could be softened by the 
gracefulness of the other ; that unbending principle and inflexible faith, could be blended with 
innocent gayety and happy simplicity. 

21. ^musemenls. There is no country in the world, where there is such a variety of amuse- 
ments, as in France ; and no people in the world are so easily amused. A stranger, who visits 
Paris for the first time, finds himself in a perpetual whirl of petty diversions, which, however 
childisl), are amusing, as long as the charm of novelty lasts, but which never become insipid to 
a Frenchman of any age or rank. One of the chief resorts of persons of every condition, in 
Paris, are the public gardens at Tivoli. They are thrown open twice a week, and brilliantly 
illuminated with colored lamps, pnd are somewhat in the style of Vauxhall, in London, but 
animated by diversions, which could never be imagined by a sober Englishman ; such as sailii^ 
in wooden boats, slung to wires ; swinging in balanpoirsy which go so high as nearly to take away 
the breath, &c. There areÂ« also, small temporary theatres, filled with mountebanks, bufibons 
of every description, fortune-tellers, dressed like hermits, and jugglers, all exciting the laughter 
and admiration of the assembled crowds. 

In some parts of the gardens, groups of well-dressed persons, of the lower class, are dancing 
to the sound of the violin, with that native ease and grace, which seem inherent to the French 
peasantry. There are, also, cafesy with ices and lemonade, for those who wish for refresh- 
ments. Tivoli is the resort of every class, the highest and the lowest ; yet there is neither 
riot nor excess of any kind. The utmost mirth, and gayety, is mingled with the most perfect 
decorum. The evening concludes with fireworks of the most brilliant description, and the 
whole scene, the lights, gay dresses, and sounds of merriment, are lively in the extreme. 
Sometimes a ^^fele extraordinaire ^\ is announced for Sundays, and more is then paid for ad- 
mission, except by the regular subscribers for the season. On these occasions, there is usually 
a mock-siege, with all the acconipaniment of cannon and fireworks, and which generally ends 
in a mock battle between the French and English, in which the latter are beaten, and dead 
bodies, in red coats, are strewed about in all directions. 

Beaujon, was another garden of the same description, famous for its Montagnes Rtuseti and 
btely suppressed, by order of government, on account of the numerous accidents, which hap- 
pened in the flying cars. A scafiblding was erected, in the form of a steep mountain. ^Over 
diia, ran an iron railroad. Small cars were drawn up to the sununit, by means of ropes attach- 
ed to the cars, and pulled round a wheel by horses. When they reached the top, they were 
pushed down with amazing rapidity. The smallest obstniction, a pebble or a piece of wood, 
OB the road, occasioned their overturn. Nothing could exceed the enthusiasm of the Parisians 
for this amusement. The cars were engaged for hours before the fete began, and anxious 
crowds stood waiting for their turn, with breathless anxiety. The Czar of Russia, when he 
risited Paris, under his traveling name of Count Ruppin, used to make frequent journeys over 
the Montagoes Russes. There are similar mountains at Tivoli, but the descent is less steepÂ«

urdms presented a blaae of variegated lamps. Tbe fomtaias played. Innmnwable crowdi 
filled every part of the Cbsffipa Elys^es, the Tuileries, and the neighboring avenues. All tbe 
Marehandt de Plaitir u Paris bad ranged their booibs along tbe gardens, with icea, con:^ 
tures, and refreshmems of every description. Bands of imnic, consisting of harps, violini, 
and botnBf 'filled tbe air mik sounds of gay music, tyroUentu* and vaudeoilUs. Women, ea- 
veloped in thick black or white veils, sat in comers of the gardens playing on guitars and sing- 
in;, attracting crowds by Aeir tir of mystet;. Tbe fireworks exhibited in front of tbe CkMAn 
dti DepvtiB were unusually splendid. 

Tbe operas and theatres in Paris are constantly crowded, notwithstanding tbeir number. 
Tbe French Opera is famous for its baHels ; the Italian Opera, for tbe excellence of its music ; 
TTiiatrt FranfOiM and tbe Odion, for the best tragedy and comedy. Besides these, there are 
the Optra Chm^ve, die TVAre 4t (^ Pwte S. Martin, the Viariiti, the Gymnast, aad many 
Dthen. Tbe Palais Royal, of which the principal part belongs to the Duke of Orleans, coa- 
-sists of the palace itself, and a lone range of arcades, celebrated for the beautiful display sad 
variety of sbops, and for its gambling-houses, more especially the talon. These gaming- 
honses were, till lately, under the protection of govemmeot ; gambting is, perhaps, tbe oa^ 
amusemeut, of a vicious descrip^on, that the French are partial to. 

But though Paris is the centre of gayety, the same love of amusement is <rf)servable through 
every part of France. Nearly all the money made by the laboring classes is spent at the aa- 
tnerous fites enjoined by tbeir religion. Th* Fite-J>ieu is one of tbe most aolemn ; and is 
cetebtated on two successive Sundays. In every town and village in France, the inhabiiaats 
are employed, for days before, m erecting and embellishing tbe reposoirei, so called, as being 
resting-places for the possession of the Host. They are stands covered with white, embroidered 
muslin and lace, adorned with rilrer candlesticks, flowers, branches, and ornaments of every 
kmi. The path by which tbe Host is to pass ii strewed with Sowers and green branches. 
The peasants are all dressed m ThÂ«r best attire. The interior of the churches is ornamented 
WTth Bowevs. Garlands are placed on the figures of tbe Madonnas and Saints ; and the priests 
are bH dressed in their moat splendid robes, to do honor to the solemnity. The Host, re- 
garded as the real presence, is carried in a vase by a priest, who conceals tbe divine symbols 
coder the folds of an embrddered veil. A canopy of crimson velvet is held over bis head by 
fonr other priests. The rest follow, singing a hymn in Latin, suitable to ibe occasion. Croff^i 
of well'dressed persons fellow. In Paris, the late king and royal family, tbe Duchesses of 
Berri and Ansouleme walked m solemn procession behind tbe priests. As tbe Host passes, die 
ndiole assembled multitude micover their heads, and prostrate themselves before St. When the 
procession arrives at the repomret, the priests stop and pronounce a prayer. These proces- 
sions are now forbidden at Paris, by order of the French government, in consequence of some 
seditious persons having taken advantage of tbem to occasion a rtot, and bolst die draptn 
blanc, but in tbe provinces they are still continued. 

Nearly every amnsement in France termioBtes by dancing. In the most remote parts ef 
the country, groups of peasants may be seen every evening dancing quadrilles and wabziK 
under (be trees, to the sound of a rusric violin, and frequently smgSng in chorus. In most (H 
the villages, there is a public house, where the village politicians assemble every evening, 
and frequently engage in fierce and vehement debates, but which usually terminates by load aad

Now there are about 43,000 elementary achooh in France, attended by 4,000,000 chlkhen, Di 
iboot four fifths tbe number between the a^es of 6 and 15 years. It has been calculated that 
neariy one half the individuals in the naiioti cannot read, though thej' are more intelligent than 
tbe same class in other countries ; probably, because they are more social. Edacfltion is now 
foceiving the attention of tiie eoverfiment, and schools upon an improved plan have been intith 
duced into every large city. The establishments for education consist in faculties, which bave

]o Paris, there is a great diflhsion of knowledge ; it is the spirit of the place, and of the

be found to be a vokime of Racine or ComeiUe, or of some author of that grade."* 

23. State of the *Srt8^ Sdenctt^ and lAt$ratur$, France is rich in sctentific workf, espe* 
ctally in zoology, botany, chemistry, and mathematics. Among many other names distingutshed 
in these sciences, are Buffmi, Cuvier, La Place, Lacep^de, Jussieu, Lavoisier, Fourcror, 
Geoffroy, &c. The French literature abounds iff excellent works on morris and law ; and m 
memoirs and letter-writing it is unrivaled. The ornamental arts are in a high state, and Paris 
is richly endowed with painting and sculpture. Many of the monuments of ancient art coltected 
by Napoleon, in the capital, are yet in France. The king's museum, in the Louvre, afibrds 
a greater display of fine paintings and fine statuary, than any other collection in the world. Yet 
these do not seem to have had the effect upon the national taste which might oaturaHj have 
been expected. A dry and insipid imitation of the Greek style distinguishes both the pais^ 
iag and sculpture of the present day in France. David, bom in 1750, was the founder ot Ae 
BQodem school of painting. In his desire to correct the florid and unmeanbg style which had 
existed since the days of Louis the Fourteenth, be fell into the contrary extreme. Hd Â»p* 
l^ed himself to the study of antique sculpture, and with much success. His drawing and de- 
sign are correct and noole, but hb works are in general devoid of simplicity and nature. I& 
his style, he resembled Pouissin, but that great artist represented the simplicity and repose of 
the ancient statues. David added forced attitudes, and exaggerated expressions to his figures. 
Yet, the Horatii of David, his Funeral of Patroclus, and his Coronation of Napoleon, are 
fine performances ; and his portraits of his Imperial patron Napoleon, can hardly be criticized. 
Those who have followed in the style of David, have in general adopted his uiults, and their 
want of talÂ«it renders their errors mbrb glaring. 

The French sculptors of the present day have more science than feeling or invention. Their 
works display the correct proportion and symmetry of the Grecian statue^, but are totally 
wanting in the divine expression and sentiment which animated these works. In the useft^ 
arts, the French have many ingenious inventions, but they are, on the whole, much behmd the 
English lo copper, steel, and wood engravings, they are also inferior ; but they have brought 
die lithographic art to great perfection, and by means of this, ^we are supplied in the United 
States with beautiful copies of many of the best paintings in Europe, as well ancient as 
â– odem. 

24. ReHgian. Until the revolution of 1830, the Roman Catholic was the estabKsfaed 
religion ; but no one sect has now any advantage over another. The following are the prin- 
eipel clergy ; there are several cardinals, all of whom have 30,000 francs a yeaf , except tbÂ» 
archbishop of Paris, who has 100,000. There are 14 archbishops, who receive (except 
ibose who are cardinals) 25,000 francs a year. There are 66 bishops, with salaries of 15,000 
francs ; 174 vicars-general, who receive from 4,000 to 3,000 francs ; 660 titular canons, or 
prebendaries, receiving from 2,400 to 1,500 francs ; 1,788 honorary canons and 3,085 cu- 
rates or rectors, receiving from 1,600 francs to 1,100 franos. 26,800 desHtvani who perform 
the duties of the titular clergy, receiving from 900 to 750 francs ; 5,756 vicars, 439 chap- 
buos, 839 almoners, 1,976 priests, resident in parishes, and 1,044 directors, and professors 
of seminaries. The total number of Catholic priests actually doinje duty is nearly 40,000w 
The number of women in religious establishments is about 20,000. There are 1,983 of these 



â€¢ France had 23 Universities before the revolation. Of 
iheae, the Sorbonne, fuanded at Paris in 1250, by Robert 
de Sorbonae, was ibe most celebrated. The academies

establishments.* The Catholic church costs the goventmeot annually 7,000^000 ddkn* In 
Paris, there are 30,000 Protestants, and in France upwards of 2,000,000. They have 96 
consistories, 438 churches, and 305 pastors, paid bj goyemmeot. The Protestant churcli^ 
costs the government annually 200,000 dollars. 

The marriages are contracted early, and among the higher classes too often by the parenti. 
The bride brings a truly liberal portion of all the various kinds of clothing, &c., called the 
trouBseaUj and it is the province of tlie bridegroom to furnish the jewels. No people are so 
poor that they have not ornaments of gold. Divorces are not common ; but there are many 
separations, which are setded by contract. The funerals and cemeteries in France are worthy 
of imitation. The dead are not laid in a dismal, and '^ neglected spot " ; but their place of 
rest is adorned with classic monuments, shaded with trees, and planted with flowers. In an 
English or American burying-ground, a person is seldom seen unless at burials ; but in France 
many of the graves are daily strewed with fresh flowers, by surviving friends ; and family, and 
other groups, are often seen among them. The cemetery of Pert la Chaise^ at Paris, is one 
of the most remarkable and interesting objects attached to the capital. 



* There are now few monatieries in France ; but 
scarcely a town of any note, where there are not one or 
more convents for nnns. Sometimes these convents are 
attached to the hospital, and the time of the nans is ex- 
clusively devoted to attendance upon the sick. In this 
case, they are not cloistered, as their duty frequently calls 
them to di^rent parts of the town or country upon er- 
rands of charity. They merely wear a peculiar dress, 
divide their time between acts of benevolence and reli- 
ffioos duties, and do not mix in society ; such are the Sours 
Tu la GkariUt and the Sawrs tU la Promdenct, of whom there 
are societies all over the continent of Europe, and who 
may be seen with their downcast looks ana folded arms 
gliding along the streets of the populous cities, apparently 
unconscious of all that is passing around them. Still 
more frequently, they devote themselves exclusively to 
the education of girls, and almost all the ladies both of 
France and Italy are brought up in these PensiontuUa, 
There are also convents, where the nuns emplov .them- 
selves both in attending the sick, and in the eoucation 
of youth ; such, for example, is the Convent of Les S(Bttrs 
Hotpitalieres ki Bayeux, a town which has now dwindled 
into comparative insignificance, but which is still the res- 
idence or a bishop, and remarkable for the elegance of its 
cathedral. 

The streets of Bayeax are mean and dirtv, and on ar- 
riving at the convent gates, the mind is totally unprepar> 
ed for the quiet and beautiful scene of seclusion which 
the interior presents ; and which is gendered doubly 
striking from its existing in the very heart of a manufac- 
turing town. Upon ringing at the gate, the door is open- 
ed by the portress, and after passing through a long stone 
passage, the stranger is conducted into a small parlor, 
advancing from the building with an iron grating in front,- 
a few chairs, and a stone noor. Behind the grating is a 
dark-red curtain, which, by its airK>f mystery, excites* a 
degree of impatient curiosity for its removal, in a few 
minutes, the curtain is drawn aside, and one of the nuns, 
probably a Saitr Supiriewe, dressed in the habit of the 
order, and distinguished by the large bunch of keys hang- 
ing at her girdle, appears at the grating and enters into 
conversation with the visiters. No gentleman can be 
admitted into the interior, but an order from the superior 
can be obtained for the admission of ladies, who wish to 
view the establishment. In the mean time, nothing can 
be moT% striking, than the scene which is visible through 
the grating, which seems like a glimpse into a world 
totally distinct from that which we have left behind us. 
In the large and beautiflil garden, tastefully diversified 
with trees and flowers of ever^ hue and variety, groups 
of nuns, with long black veils, may be seen Riding 
among the trees and through the winding alleys. Some 
are employed in teaching the pensionnaireSf some are em- 
broidering under the shade of the trees. All seem cheer* 
ful and contented ; all are occupied, and pursuing their 
various tasks with assiduity. When the order for admis- 
sion in obtained, the inner gates are opened, and the M^ 
SupMeure, a venerable old lady, leaning <m a staff, re- 



ceives the strangers, and conducts them into the garden, 
where a nearer view of the inmates tends to dissipate still 
more eflfectually those ideas of gloom, which seem cob- 
nected with a conventual life. 

The convent is a large stone building of great antiqui- 
ty, and formerly one of die wealthiest in France. It con- 
tains upwards of two hundred nuns, governed by a supe- 
rior, chosen from among their body ; and at whose elec- 
tion is a solemn religious ceremony. The superior is 
appointed for a certain number of years, but at the end of 
that period, the same is usually reelected. Of these 
nuns, the greater part are cloistered, but there are some 
lay-sisters, and numerous novices. Though there are 
many of their number belonging to the old^t families in 
France, and some of a much lower rank, there are no dis- 
tinctions of that nature among them. By turns they 
make the beds, sweep the floors, and attend upon the 
others at table. Nothing is more deserving of attention 
than the hospitals which form part of the building. They 
consist of two large and airy apartments ; th^ one destin- 
ed for the^reception of men, the other for that of women. 
There are a hundred beds in each, and the scrupulous 
neatness and cleanliness which reigns throughout; the 
kindness with which the nuns talk to the invalids ; ^ 
pleasure which their visit seems to afford to these poof 
people ; and the respect and gratitude with which they 
are regarded ; cannot fail to imprera the stranger with a 
favoraole idea of the establishment. Two small labora- 
tories are attached to these rooms ; in each of wliich a 
nun is in constant attendance, to mix up medicines, and 
have in readiness all that may be wanted for the invalids. 
They are very skilful, both in surgery and roedicine ; and 
dress the wounds of their patients with their own hands, 
watch by them all night, and spare neither trouble nor 
fatigue in their service. Persons with malignant diseases, 
such as small-pox or typhus fever are not admitted, on 
account of the pensionnaireSf who would thus be exposed 
to infection. 

The dormitory for the penswrmaires is a noble apart- 
ment, a hundred feet in length, having two long rsnges 
of small beds, with curtains as white as snow. A laree 
lamp hangs from the roof, and is kept burning all nignt 
Two nuns sleep in the apartment, to take charge of the 
boarders. The other nuns sleep in separate cells, small 
rooms with no other furniture tnan a bKpd, a chair, a cru- 
cifix, and a few prints of saints or Madonnas. A hand- 
some chapel belongs to the convent, where the Bishop of 
Bayeux officiates upon great occasions. The hours of 
prayer are numerous. At 12o*clock, when the augelus 
is rung, they meet in the chapel ; also in the afteraooi, 
for vespers. At all hours of the day some of the nuns 
may be seen in the chapel, kneeling on the floorÂ» like 
motionless figures of stone, muttering their prayers before 
the altar. A confessor belongs to the convent, chosen by 
the bishop, and admitted at all hours. Occasionally, tfaie 
superior receives the visits of other priests, and permits 
the nuns to see him, aocordmi to her discretion. The 
lay-tiftsn at* permitted to wuk with the boanlant and

S5Â» thtfemmeni* Since the meetmg of ibe States General, in 1769, France bas barf 
Be kfis than ten constitutions. In 1791, a limited monarchy was established, with ^ a single 
legislative assembly ; in 1793, a democratic republic succeeded, but never went into effect, being 
reined by the dictatorship of the convention and those who conirolled it ; in 1795, the direo- 
tory with two chambers was introduced; in 1799, the consulate ; in 1804, the empire of 
BoDffparte; in 1814, a limited monarchy, under the Bourbons, with two chambers, hereditary 
peerage, and 130,000 electors; in 1830, limited monarchy, with Liouts Pbillippe for king, with 
two dianibers, a peerage for life, and 200,000 electors; in 1848, a republic, with a president 
(or three years not re-elegible, a siugle chamber and universal suffrage; in 1851, a presideot- 
diotator; in 1852, the restored empire under Napoleon III. 

26. Laws. Several hundred particular systems of customs have been reduced to five 
codes, with general principles ; the'civii code, or general law of the country ; the commercial 
code, the penal code, and the codes of civil and of commercial procedure. T4iey embody 
wbat was before loose, voluminous, and little known ; the old laws of France are, therefore, 
necessarily referred to, for the illustration of these codes. The civil code has not been 
changed by the Restoration, except in its name, which was before that event, the Code Na- 
poleon. The criminal code is not sanguinary, though it has been charged with giving too 
much power to the officers of government, in the selections of jurors. The courts are mod- 
eled on the English plan. 

27. JntiquUies. The antiquities are principally architectural, and are generally included 
in our description of towns. There are, however, many Roman remains. At Paris, there 
is one apartment, 60 feet long, and 42 wide, vaulted, and having 3 interior arcades, the sole 
remnant of the Palace of the Warm Baths, built by Constantius. At Lyons, there are sev- 
eral antiquities, especially the remains of two aqueducts, ascribed to Mark Antony, or 
A^ippa ; a beautiful mosaic, the ruins of a theatre, and of subterraneous reservoirs. Many 
medals, coins, vases, statues, &c., have been found in the vicinity. At Nimes, are more 
perfect monuments. The beautiful edifice, ^niscalled the Maison Carrity is in almost perfect 
preservation. It was some public edifice with a portico of six Corinthian columns in front, 
and three on each side. The cornice, frieze, capitals, and carved acanthus leaves, are perfect 
models in architecture and sculpture. The Temple of Diana has also much of the noble 
simplicity of ancient art. 

But the greatest monument, though not the most beautiful of ancient Nimes, the aUtra 
Romay is the amphitheatre, which has no superior, but the Coliseum, and which is in a better 
state of preservation than that. It is of cut stones of prodigious size, which have the marks 
of the fire made by Charles Martel, to dislodge the Saracens. The porticoes are perfect, 
with columns, pilasters, and decorations, especially two bull's heads, two gladiators, and the 
she wolf with Romulus and Remus. There are also baths, mosaic pavements, and various 
fragments. The Pont du Card, 7 leagues from Nimes, is a stupendous Roman monument. 
This was an aqueduct across a river, composed of three several bridges, one above the other, 



toij be eent on errands, when anything is wanted for the 
OR of the convent. 1^ novices are strictly watched, 
ud seMom allowed to leave the gates. They are distin* 
paished from the others by their white veil. Their co- 
viciate lasts three years, and a considerable sam is paid 
liy tbem on entering, afler which they are maintained by 
toe estsblishment. The ceremony of taking the black 
retl is one of the most solemn and beautiful in the Roman 
Citbdic religion. 

IKgh OMM is celebrated in the chapel. The fiishop 
oftciales in his splendid robes. The novice appears dress- 
Â«d in white, and sometimes decked with jewels like a 
tvide. She kneels before the altar while the Bishop pro- 
oooncet a discourse upon the solemnity of the vows 
abich he is aboat to pronounce. She then retires behind 
the altar. Her long hair is cut off and she is invested 
vith the nan*8 garment. She is then led forward to the 
Kshop, and having pronounced upon her knees, her in- 
tention of abjuring the world, and devoting herself to the 
â– ervice of Gkid, she receives his benediction. The black 
veil is thrown over her. A solemn hymn is chanted to 
the notes of the orffan, and the gates of the convent are 
kroeefbrwird closed upon her forever. It is true, that by 
the order of govemnnent, all nuM are now regarded as 
fite from thelir T*in after â€¢ oertain period; but though â€¢ 



nun who breaks her vows is no longer built up in a wall 
as in days of old, yet there is a braien wall of prejudice 
and public opinion, which is almost as formidable to her , 
and It is probable, that a long period will elapse before anj 
female will have courage to l)reak through these barriers, 
and to expose herself to the scorn of her companions, and 
the indignation of the Church. 

The dress of the Sours HospitaUeres is a robe of white 
oasimir; a white muslin bandeau which crosses their 
forehead, with two long pieces of white muslin, which 
fold across the breast ; a long veil of black crape, whioh 
conceals part of the face, and hangs down to the knees ; 
a black and gold rosary with an iron cross upon which is 
an image of the crucifixion, and which usually contains 
relics, such as small pieces of the bones of saints; a piece 
of the true cross, &e, dbc. The nuns read no books 
which are not first examined by their confessor, and these 
are usually limited to the lives of the saints, and other 
works of a religious nature. Their evenings invariably 
conclude with psalms and prayers, performed in a large 
parlor, where they assemble when the duties of the day 
are over. The beauty of their embroidery is fiunous all 
over Europe. It is usually employed in robes for tlit 
priests, ana hangings for the altars.

ptrle, who became consul of the French Republic. He put an end to factions, added new 
gloiy to the national arms, closed the gulf of the revolution, and gave a short peace to France.

in the overtbrow of the king on tbe 30th of July, 1830. Louis Pliillippi, of the house of ' 
Orieans, succeeded as citizen king, hut was himself expelled in February 1848, by a similar 
JaaurrectioD. After a republic for three years, Louis Piapoleoo became first president â€” dictator 
md tbeo emperor. 

CHAPTER VU. REPUBLIC OF ANDORRA. 

Tbis little state is situated on the southern declivity of the Pyrenees, between Catalonia, in 
Spain, and tbe department of Arriege, in France. The population of tbe republic is 15,400, 
occupying 34 villages, and 190 square miles of territory. The capital, Andorra, has 2,000 
bhabitants. Iron and wood are tbe principal prsductions. Tbe government is administered 
by a council, over which presides a syndic ; two judges, one appointed by the king of France, 
tnd the other by ibe bishop of Orgel, in Spain, preside over the administration of justice in tbe 
letired and peaceful valley of Andorra.

PHYSICAL GEOORAPHT. 



1. Bowidaritt and Exttnt. Spain is bounded north by tbe Bay of Biscay and France, east 
â– kI south by the Mediterranean and the Straits of Gibraltar, and west by Portugal and the 
Atlantic. It extends from 35'^ 57' to 43Â° 44' N. latitude, and from. 3Â° 20" E . to 9Â° 40' W. 
lop^^tude. Its greatest length, from east to west, is â‚¬40 miles, and its breadth 530, and itcon- 
laias 163,000 square miles.

% .Mmfitatfir. The Pyreneti separate this kingdom ffKBii Isaacs, aoi rati east ana watt 
from the MediterraDean to the Atlantic, sktrtiog the whole southern shore of the bay ot BiacajF 
la common language, the name of Pyrenees is applied only to that part of the range betiaecc 
France and Spain ; the western portions are known by the appellations of tbe MfoufUaim 0fBi3eajf^ 
the Sierra of Jl^uriasy the MawfUaint qf Mondonedoj SemdllMaMy and Vindha. Tb^ wera 
â€¢ known to tlie ancients by the name of the CarUabrian Mountains, This range is^ in sonoe 
parts, 120 miles in breadth. The eastern peak of the Maladetia^ the loftiest sunuoit, rises to 
the height of 11,441 feet. On the south, the Pyrenees have a sterile appearance ; but tfaeir 
northern sides are less precipitous, and afford many woods and pastures. Their highest sum- 
mits are capped with perpetual snow. The level country on the French side is much lower 
than on the side of Spain. The most important defiles through these noountains, leading from 
France to Spain, are from St. Jean de Luz to Irun ; tbe pass of Roncesvalles,and the pass 
near the Mediterranean, from Perpignan to Barcelona. 

Proceeding south from these mountains, we come to a second range branching ofi* irr^ularly 
from the Pyrenees, first southeasterly, and then southwesterly. This is called ibe ieertÂ«fÂ» 
Chain^ and, as it approaches toward Portugal, ^kes tbe name of Monie Gata. It divides Old 
from New Castile, and bears, ia different parts, tbe names of Giuidarrama^ Urbia^ Oca^ Man" 
cago^ &c. Nearly parallel to the southern part of this, is another range, called the Skrra dt 
Guadalupe^ in tbe north termed the Mountains of Toledo, StiU further south is the Sitrra 
Morena^ or Brown Mountain^ which, in tbe time of tbe Saracen dominion, was tbe boundary 
between Moorish and Christian Spain. Tbe most southerly range is the Sierra Mvada, er 
snowy ridge, which skirts tbe Mediterranean. These are the highest mountains in Spain. 
Tbe Cumbre de Mulahacen^ their loftiest point, rises to tbe height of 1 1 ,698 feet. Tbe high 
summits are covered tbe whole year with snow, and ice, and may be seen from the distant coast 
of Africa. On tbe other mountains of Spain, tbe snow seldom lies longer than a few months. 
Many of them are entirely barren, and exhibit nothing but a naked assemblage of crags thrown 
together in tbe most picturesque manner. Some are covered with a scanty crop of grass and 
brushwood, and others are clothed with magnificent forests. Firs, oaks, and cork-trees grow 
in tbe higher regions. Chestnuts, tamarisks, pines, and birches clothe their bases. 

Tbe Mountain of Montserrat^ is a detached eminence of the eastern Pyrenees, about 30 
miles northwest of Barcelona. It consists of a cluster of sharp peaks, risine to tbe height of 
3,300 feet, and always capped with clouds. The whole mountain is 34 miles in circumference 
There are 14 hermitages upon different parts of these heights, and about half wav up, is a mae- 
nificent convent of Benedictines. The scenery, in every part of this remarkable eroioeDce^ w 
strikingly bold and romantic. 

3. Valleys. Tbe great valleys of this country, are traversed by tbe 5 principal rivers, de- 
scribed under the next bead ; their general outlipes may be understood, from tbe preceding de- 
scription of tbe mountain ranges, which mark their Hmita. 

4. Rinert. The Tsjo, or Tagm^ rises in the Sierra de Albarraetn, in Arragoii, and Sows 
west, between tbe Iberian chain of mountains and the Sierra de Guadatupe> through Portiinl, 
into the Atlantic. It is a large river, with steep banks and a rapid current ; but is not naviga* 
ble, on account of its rocks and shallows. The Guadiana rises in La Maneba, and Bows 
smith westerly, between tbe mountains of Guadalupe and the Sierre Morena^ to the Atlantic, 
intersecting tbe southern part of Portugal, and, at its mouth, forming the boundary between the 
two kingdoms. It is navigable for 45 miles from its mouth. The Guadalquivir Sows between 
the Sierra Morena and tbe Sierra Nevada, southwesterly, to tbe sea. It is a Wauttful stream, and 
is navigable in the lower part of its course. In tbe north of Spain, is the I)uero^ flowing wc^st, 
through Portugal, into the Athmtic. The Ebro rises among the noountains in tbe north, and 
runs southeasterly into the Mediterranean ; its mouth is shaHow and sandy. The Guadalaviar 
and Xucar^ are smaller streams, running in the same direction. Most of the rivers of Spain 
have shallow and stony beds, and dry up in sinnmer to such a degree, as to be nearly usel es s 
for navigation. 

5. Islands. Tbe Balearic Islands are a group in the Mediterranean, consisting of Majorca, 
Minorca, Ivica, and Fromeniera, with some smaller ones. Majorca, tbe largest, is about lOO 
miles from tbe coast. It is 40 miles in extent, each way, and is mountainous. Minorca pos- 
sesses the valuable harbor of Port Mahon. These islands have generally a good soil, and pro- 
duce oranges, olives, wine, &c., and they have 240,000 inhabitants. 

6. Coasts. Tbe shores are generally bold, and are furnished with many safe and commodi 
ouÂ« harbors, but there are no very large bays, or gulfs. 



Spain. 189 

7. Chmate. This country lies in the southern part of the temperate zone. The cold is 
oerer excessive, even in the northern parts. In the soutn, the heats of midsummer vi^ould be 
intolerable, but for the sea-breeze, which begins to blow at 9 in the morning, and continues till 
5 in ^he evening. The interior is so elevated, as to be much cooler than might be expected, 
from the latitude The two Castiles form a raised plain, nearlv 2,000 feet in height. The prov- 
inces, along the Mediterranean, are the paradise of this kingdom. A.i everlasting spring 
zeems to reign in this delightful country. The sky of Andalusia is pure azure and gold ; the 
inhabitants of Seville affirm, that a day was never known, when the sun did not shine upon 
their city. Two kinds of winds are sometimes unpleasant in Spain. The GallegOj from the 
northwest, is piercing and cold ; the Solano^ a southwest wind, from Africa, is so hot, as to 
relax the human system, and produce giddiness and inflammation. 

8. SoiL The greater part of the country is fertile, and covered with a luxuriant vegetation. 
The fruits and plants offer a greater variety than is aflbrded by any other region of the same 
extent. The land is everywhere favorable to the cultivation of the vine. The greater part of 
Spain may be regarded as naturally the most fruitful country of Europe ; but there are exten- 
sitre wastes in the interior. 

9* Geology. The Pyrenean mountains are granitic, as are also the central ridges ; schistus 
and calcareous rocks, as well as sandstone, abound among them. The low plains are covered 
with alluvial deposits, mixed with fossil bones. In the south, the mountains contain schistus, 
sandstone, and gneiss ; and in this quarter, are vestiges of volcanic craters. 

f O. Natural Productions, There are 8 species of oak among the forest trees. Three of 
these are particularly valuable ; the evergreen oak, or quercus bellota, with edible fruit ; the 
cork oak, and the cochineal oak, on which the false cochineal, yielding a fine crimson cdor, is 
found. The other common trees, are tamarisks, pines, birches, chestnuts, pistaches, firs, pop- 
lars, &c. The fruits of the south are lemons, oranges, pomegranates, figs, olives, almonds, 
fcc. The date palm grows upon the shore of the Mediterranean, and the exportation of dates 
Orom Spain forms a thriving branch of trade. 

1 1 . JUinerals. Spain supplied the ancient inhabitants of Europe with the greater part of 
the precious metals they possessed, but her mineral products are small at the present day. 
Mines of Quicksilver are wrought at Almaden, in La Mancha, and iron is furnished by the pro- 
vinces of Biscay. Coal is wrought in Catalonia and Asturias. Crystalized sulphur is found 
in the neighborhood of Cadiz. 200 species of marble are enumerated in the kingdom. 

12. Mineral Springs. These are very numerous, and are estimated, by some, at 1,200; 
but regular watering-places, and bathing establishments, do not exist in Spain. A hospital is 
the only common accompaniment. The springs of Trillo, or Guadalaxara, are used for drink- 
ing and bathing. Those of Sierra Vermeja, in Grenada, contain iron and sulphur. Those of 
Buzpt, in Valencia, sulphur, iron, and salt. The bath^ of Archena, in Murcia, and Caldar de 
McHibuy, were known to the Romans. 

13. Animals. Almost all the wild animals of Southern France, are common to Spain. The 

ffttains and mountains abound in game. The wild boar, the bear, and various kinds of deer, are 
ouikI in the mountains of Galicia, and the Asturian forests. Hares, rabbits, partridges, fla- 
mingoes, and bustards, are common in AAdalusia. The wolf still frequents nearly all the wood- 
ed and mountainous districts of the country. The chamois and the lynx find a shelter in the 
Pyrenees, and the other mountains of the east. The moufflon is found in the kingdom of 
Murcia. The genet, porcupine, scorpion, and chameleon, may also be mentioned. Cantha- 
rides^ tarantulus, and niosquitoes, abound. Estremadura and Andalusia, are sometimes deso- 
bt#d by swarms of locusts from the African coast. 

14. Face of the Country. Spain is an elevated, mountainous, and beautifully picturesque 
coutitry. It exhibits an alternation of mountain ridges and wide plains, everywhere watered 
bf rivers and small streams. The hills are covered with vinejrards, and tbe valleys display the 
flBoat Itrxtiriant vegetation. The southern part looks like a garden in perpetual bloom. In exÂ« 

emal beauty, few countries in the world equal Spain* 



190 SPAIN. 



POUTICAL GEOGRAPHT. 

â€¢ 

1. Divisions. Spain is divided into 13 captaincies, some of which have the titie of king- 
doms, and most of them are subdivided into several smaller provinces,* for civil purposes. 

2. Canals. There are only two navigable canals of any importance. The Imperial Cand 
was begun with the intention of uniting Navarre with the Mediterranean, and is finished to 
below Saragossa. Jt is 74 feet wide, and lOJ feet deep, bein^ navigable for vessels of 100 
tons. The Canal of Castile is partly executed, and is designed to connect the Duero wiih 
the harbor of Santander, on the Bay of Biscay. There are several other small canals in dif- 
ferent parts of the kingdom. 

3. Towns, Madrid^ the capital, stands in the centre of the kingdom, in the midst of a 
barren plain 2,200 feet above the level of the sea, and surrounded by mountains. It has s 
handsome appearance ; the streets are regular, and many of the buildings magnificent. It has 
42 squares and many beautiful public walks. The Prado is an elegant promenade ou die east 
side of the city, planted with trees, and ornamented with fountains. Here the wealthy and 
fashionable display their equipages, and hither all ranks resort in quest of amusement. Many 
of the squares are adorned with fountains ; the handsomest b the Plaza Mayor, where the 
markets are held. The houses are generally of brick, and few of them have glass windows 
Several royal palaces adorn the city and neighborhood. The new palace, considered ibe 
finest royal residence in Europe, forms a square of 404 feet, and 86 feet high ; the Bueo 
Retire, another palace, is famous for its beautiful gardens. There is a magnificent bridge 
over the Manzanares, a little stream which runs by the city. Madrid contains 75 convents, 
77 churches, 3 theatres, 18 colleges, &c. The learned societies, and cabinets of science 
and art are numerous, and give this city a high rank among the first capitals of Europe, in 
regard to learning and the arts. The Royal Library is rich in manuscripts, models, and 
antiquities, and contains 250,000 volumes. The charitable institutions are numerous ; they 
are richly endowed, and the buildings pertaining to them are spacious and well attended. 
Madrid is a place of considerable trade and industry , the inhabitants manufacture woolen stuffs 
of every sort, carpets, silks, printed linens, and muslins. Population, 201,000. 

Twenty-two miles northwest of Madrid is the Escurial, the most magnificent monastery Id 
the world ; it is built in a wild and rugged region, and forms a quadrangle 740 feet long, by 
580 wide. It contains the royal apartments, a fine library and collection of paintings, and the 
sumptuous vaults in which are deposited the remains of the Spanish kings. The Escurial was 
built by Philip the Second, a stern and superstitious prince, in fulfilment of a vow, and dedi- 
cated to St. Lawrence, who suffered martyrdom by being burned to death upon the gridiron ; 
tlie building is, therefore, made to represent that instrument. At St. IldefonsOy 40 miles north 
of Madrid, is a superb palace, celebrated for its beautiful gardens ; here is also a royal manu- 
factory of mirrors, which are made of great size and superior quality. 

Seville^ the capital of Andalusia, is beautifully situated on the Guadalquivir. It stands in 
the midst of a plain, covered with olive plantations, hamlets, villages, and convents. It was 
formerly very rich and populous, being the chief mart for the American and India trade. The 
public buildings are very elegant. The general appearance of the city indicates the Moorish 
character of its former possessors. The streets are often so narrow, that a person can touch 
the houses on both sides at once. The principal public buildings are the cathedral, the hrgat 
gothic edifice in Spain, with 82 altars and a fine tower ; the archbishop's palace, a magnificent 
structure ; the alcazar, or palace of the ancient Moorish kings ; 84 convents ; 24 hospitals ; 
29 churches ; the Exchange, Jic. Seville contains a university, 9 colleges, and a school of 
tauromachy, in which the buU-fighters are trained. Its manufactures are extensive, compris*

mg silks, woolens, and tobacco. Several steam vessels navigate the river, but its commerca 
has been mostly transferred to Cadiz. Population, 91,000. 

Barcelona^ the principal manufacturing city of Spain, and one of the prettiest on the penin- 
sula, is regularly built upon the shores of the Mediterranean. Its commerce is extensive, but 
ibe immense mole, designed to protect the harbor from the accumulation of sand, is unfinished. 
Cotton, silk, linen, lace, and arms are the principal products of its manufactories. Here are 
4 public libraries, 8 colleges, several hospitals, numerous churches, and some remarkable 
public edifices. Population, 120,000. In the vicinity are Tarragonay with 1 1 ,000 inhabit- 
ants, and TortoM with 16,000, remarkable for the ruins of their ancient splendor ; ReuSy an 
active manufacturing town, with 25,000 inhabitants, and Figueras, celebrated for its vast and 
impregnable fortifications. 

Fmlencia is a rich and elegant city, situated in a fertile and delightful country on the GuaÂ« 
dalaviar, not far from the sea. It is one of the most flourishing manufacturing towns in Spain^ 
lod is inferior only to Madrid in the activity of its printing presses, and the extent of its book 
trade. Its literary institutions are numerous, and its beautiful walks are perfumed with the 
orange and lemon groves, by which they are shaded. Population, 66,000. 

The other principal places in the captain-generalship of Valencia are Orihuehj with 26,000 
iobabitants. and extensive manufactures; ^licant^ a strongly fortified and active commercial 
town, with a fine harbor and a population of 25,000 ; Murciaj with 36,000 inhabitants, con- 
taining numerous literary institutions, and extensive manufactures of silk ;^ Lorca^ a manufao- 
turing town, with 40,000 inhabitants, and Carthagtnay with 37,000, noted for its docks, 
arsenals, observatory, and excellent harbor. 

Granada^ situated in a plain renowned for the fertility of its soil, the beauty of its scenery^ 
aod its delicious climate, is an ancient Moorish city ; several magnificent edifices, its exten- 
sire squares, and numerous fountains attest its ancient splendor. The cathedral and the 
palaces of the archbishop and of the captain -general are spacious and elegant ; but the boast 
of Granada is the Alhambra, or palace of the Moorish kings, which is admired for the richness 
and beauty of its vast colonnades, its splendid courts, its halls and arcades. Every traveler has 
been struck with admiration at the sight of its splendid halls> golden saloons, courts, alcoves, 
fountains, colonnades, and mosaic pavements, which almost realize the description of fairy 
land. No wonder the Moors never ceased to regret the loss of Granada. Even to this day, 
they are said to offer up prayers every Friday for the recovery of this city, which they esteem 
a terrestrial paradise. The Generalife is another palace, which afforded a summer retreat to 
the Moorish princes. Granada is now the seat of a university, and various manufactures. Its 
population is 80,000. On the coast of Granada is Malaga^ a commercial city, situated in a 
rich district, producing almonds, figs, and oranges, which, with dried raisins and wines from 
the hills, and cork from the mountains, constitute its principal exports. Population, 52,000. 

Cordova^ on the Guadalquivir, is an ancient town, partly of Roman and partly of Moorish 
origin. Many of the buildings are in ruins, and it contains extensive gardens ; the population, 
therefore, does not correspond with the extent of the city. ,The archbishop's palace, for- 
merly the residence of the Moorish kings, and the cathedral, originally a mosque, ornamented 
with rows of cupolas, which are supported by 850 columns of jasper and marble, are remark- 
able buildings. Cordova has always carried on considerable trade, and has long been noted 
for its manufactures of leather. Population, 57,000. Ecija^ with 35,000 inhabitants, and 
Jaen^ with 20,000, are important manufacturing towns in the* vicinity. 

CadiZj situated on a fine bay, at the extremity of a projecting tongue of land, is a well built 
tod strongly fortified city, with an extensive commerce. The trade of the rich colonies of 
Spain in India and America, formerly centered in Cadiz, but after their separation from the 
mother country, the place sank in importance. It is now, however, a free port, and has 
somewhat revived. Population, 53,000. 

Opposite Cadiz is Port St. Mary^ and to the southeast is San Fernando^ containing an 
observatory and the custom-house of the port of Cadiz. Each of these towns has 18,000 in- 
babitaots. Fifteen miles northeast of Cadiz, in a rich district, is Xeres, noted as the depot 
(or the excellent wines, called from this place. Sherry. It is a flourishing town, with 34,000 
iobabitants, and contains a celebrated Carthusian convent. On the coast |o the south of Cadis 
it Cape Trafalgar, near which Nelson gained a celebrated naval victory over the united Span- 
bh and French fleets ; and to the north is the little village of Palosy from which Columbua 
â€¢â– Sed on his first voyage of discovery.

Bttmgo89a, the capital of Arragoo, stands upon both sides of the Ebro, owet which rtiere m 
a superb stone bridge of 7 arches. Before the memorable siege of 1808, its churches were re- 
markable for their magnificence and wealth, but, with the other public buildings, they suffered 
much iniury at that time. The church of Our Lady of the Pillar is remarkable for its splen- 
4or, and for its miraculous image of the Virgin Afary) which attracts numerous pilgrims from 
aU parts of the country. The uniTersity of Saragossa is one of the principal in Spain. Pop* 
tdetion, 43,000. 

Stmtiuge^ or St, Jago de ComposltUa^ the principal city of Galicia, has extensive manufac- 
tares of silk and cotton, and contains one of the principal Spanish universities. Its cathedral, 
consecrated to St. James, (in Spanish, Jago,) the patron saint of Spain, is supposed to contam 
his remains, and is visited by great numbers of pilgrims. Population, 28,000. 

Corvmna^ the capital of Galicia, is a flocorishing and stron^y fortified town, with extensive 
trade and manufactures. Population, 23,000. The harbor is spacious and safe, and is es- 
teemed one of the best in Spain. Here are an arsenal and an ancient tower of great height 
and solidity, by some attribnted to the Phoenicians, by others to the Romans. 

Falladolidy capital of Old Castile, and the scene of many interesting events in Spanish his- 
tory, is now much declined from its former splendor, and conudns but 21,000 inhabitants. Its 
university is the second in Spain, and there are here 8 colleges and 46 convents. The royal 
eastle, in which several of the Spanish kings were born, and the cathedral, are the most re- 
fMirkable edifices. 

The other principal places in Old Castile are Santandery a flourishing commercial town, on 
the northern coast, with 20,000 inhabitants ; Burgos^ with 12,000 inhabitants, containing a 

Seat number of churches and convents ; Segavia^ a very old town, with numerous Roman and 
oorish remains, 1 3,000 inhabitants ; and Salamanca^ formerly the seat of one of the most 
celebrated universities of Europe, which has now lost its ancient importance. 

Bilboa^ the capital of Biscay, and one of the principal commercial towns of Spain, has 
15,000 inhabitants. 

(hitda^ capital of the Asturias, and Badajoz^ capital of Estremadura, have each a popuIa> 
lion of 10,000. 

Pampelonoj a strongly fortified place, with 15,000 inhabitants, is the capital of Navarre. 

Pahna^ on Majorca, is the capital of the Balearic isles, and has an extensive commerce. 
Population, 34,000. Port Mahoriy on the eastern coast of Minorca, has one of the safest and 
most convenient harbors in the Mediterranean. It is strongly fortified, and contains a naval 
iiospital, an arsenal, and one of the finest lazarettos in Europe. 

CHbrahar is an important fortress, situated on a rocky promontory, at the entrance of the 
straits of the same name, and rendered impregnable by nature and art. The promontory is 
7 miles in length, and nowhere half a mile in width, and the rocky wall rises precipitously to 
the height of above 1 ,400 feet. Every point bristles with batteries, which communicate with 
each other by covered ways hewn out of the solid rock. The town of Gibraltar stands at the 
foot of the promontory^ upon a spacious bay, which forms a convenient naval station. lis 
commerce is extensive ; population, 1 5,000 ; English, Moors, Jews, Italians, and Spaniards. 
This fortress was taken by the British in 1704, and has ever since remained in their pos- 
#easion. 

4. Agriculture. The greater part of the land in Spain, belongs to the nobility, the chiu^clK 
the towns, or corporate bodies. ' The state of agriculture is wretched, and the implements of 
husbandry are very rude ; hardly two-thirds of the productive soil is under cultivation. Hemp 
and com are raised in aknost all the provinces ; olives and the sugar-cane are cultivated in the 
southern parts, and in this quarter may be seen large fields of safi!ron, rice, and cotton. Every 
)MU-t of the country yields wine. The rearing of sheep is an important branch of industry, 
and the wool is distinguished for its fineness. The Merinos, or fine-wooled sheep, pass the 
anntmer in the mountainous districts of Castile and Arragon, and the winter in the plains of 
Andalusia and Estremadura. They are driven this distance of nearly 700 miles, in 40 days, 
in flocks of 10,000. The Mesta, or society composed of the owners of the sheep, has the 
rtâ‚¬ht to drive them over the land which lies on the route, and to feed them on the pastures ; 
where (he bnd is cultivated, the proprietor is obliged to leave a space 250 feet in breadth for 
their passage. The whole number of riiebp in Spain is about 18 millioos, mope then half of 
iÂ»hich migrate annually. 

5. Comnuree. The foreign commerce of Spain is not extensive ; wine, oH, fruits, wool^ 



SPAIN. 193 

Hd iMmi&DUired goods, are dla principal articles of export. The coastioj trade u verf Ac- 
tive and important ; but the waot of good roads, navigable rivers, and canals, is fatal lo the 
intemal commerce. The anchovy, tunny, and coral fisheries are actively prosecuted. 

6. Mmufaetura. The system of taxation, founded upon production, and die privileges * 
particular classes and societies, tend to discourage industry in Spain ; yet her manufactures are 
br DO means inconsiderable. The most important are those of wool, silk, leather, and cottoo. 
Paper, bats, soap, earthern, iron, and steel wares, brandy, &c., are also among the products 
1^ Spanish industry. The manufacture of barilla, from which soda is obtained, is extensively 
carried on in tbe districts bordering on the Mediterranean. It is made fay burning a vegetable, 
which is somi for the purpose. When grown, the plant is pulled up, stacked, and dried. 
Circular pits are then made in the ground and heated ; bars are laid across these, and the weed 
piled upon them, where it melts, drops into the pit, and hardens into a mass. The land for tba 
cultivation of this plant requires much dressing. 

7. Mubitantt. The Spaniard is compounded of various races, principally of tbe Celtic, 
tbe Roman, the Gothic, and the Arabic. In the north, the Gothic is ihe most pure, but io 
tbe south tbe Moorish predominates. The distinctions between people of the different prov- 
inces are equal to tbe general difference between those of separate nations. The Biscayans are 
light and graceful, though hardy ; the Galicians, lofty in stature, and laborious ; the Cestitiam, 
tall and dark ; the Murcians, lighter in complexion, and there are many points of difference ia 
tbe other provinces. But it is of the mass, that we have to speak ; and those are the Basques, 
in Biscay and Navarre, descended from the ancient Cantabrians ; tbe descendants of tbe 
Moors, chiefly in the Alpujarras ; the Gypsies, who are scattered over Spain under the name 
of Gilanos ; and lastly, and principally, the general inhabitants or Spaniards. The Spaniards 
are tall and geserally slender ; or less thick-set than the people of the north of Europe. 
Their complexion is an olive, their faces are somewhat long, their hair is black, and they have, 

almost universally, brilliant attd 
piercing eyes. Tbe women, if 
not models for beauty, are distin- 
guished for their attractions ; but 
these arise rather from glow of 
sentiment, ardor of feeling, and 
wonderful grace of motion, than 
from regularity of feature, or the 
training in the arts of pleasing, 
which is a part of female education 
in France. 

The classes are, generally, the 
nobility and tbe plebeiatis ; and in 
no country is the accidental dijfer- 
eitce of birth so strictly enforced: 
a hidalgo, or a " son of some- 
Strtitaiiiig, body," is one of tbe small nobil- 

ity, without a particular title ; and 
nine promotions in the army are made in favor of the nobility, before the tenth chance is 
open to tbe brave sergeant, who has, perhaps, led the forlorn hope, and mounted the breach. 
The tilled nobility consist in dukes, marquises, counts, viscounts, and barons. These are 
chiefly styled "illustrious," and addressed as "their eminences," and they prefix the Don to their 
Christian names. The nobility are ambitious of having in their family several " hats "; or of 
uniting in tlieirown person, the right of several titles, each one of which gives the privilege of 
wearing a bat in the presence of tbe king. Some have, by inberiiance or marriage, the right 
of wearing 8 or 10 hats. A nobleman " on four sides," is one whose parents, their parents, 
and their parents* parents, were all noble ; and such only are knighted. But as the proof of 
die lineage comes through the notaries, it is not difficult for any rich aspirant for honors to ob- 
tain a favorable cerii6caie. A person of a pure lineage, without Jewish, Moorish, or heretical 
blood, the law calls " an old Christian, without taint." It is a calamity for even a peasant to 
ba\'e bad a remote ancestor a Jew, an Indian, an African, or a Moor. To such, even the 
social religious fraternities are closed. Where the original of a family roust be so pure,

>a of the diSerenl provinces is, in raany inslaaces, vanous ; [bou|hsoDB 
I run through all Spain. OenersUf , the cloak is worn, and it is tmnei- 
' large, and so full, that one end is ihrowo over the shoulder. It la stid, 
that Done but a SpaKiard can wear it gracefully, and be draws it 
into many elegant folds. The very children wear it, aad are 
often encumbered wiib it at play. The females aeldom appear 
in public, in any but the national dress ; the color of nbicn it 
principally black. Tbe priests watch, wiib great jealouiy, all 
innovation in dress. The manlilla is a black scarf, of Tariom 
degrees of richness, thrown over the head, yet so as to display i 
large and costly comb. It leaches to the waist. Fen ladiei 
wear veib, except at mass. The basquiiia is a black petticoat, 
and it is as general as the mantilla, or shawl. Neither bonnei on 
ribands are worn, though in carriages, and at some assemblies, 
ladies may be seen dressed in the French mode. Tbe fan is 
'carried by all females ; as well by the lady in ber carriage, as the 
servant, with a bundle, in tbe street. It is an instrument of fas- 
cination, in the hands of a lady, and all its motions are graceful; 
it has even a language bf its own, which is said to be rich in temu 
It is a great study in a Spanish female, to set out her foot to tbe 
! neat stocking, and small shoe, are, therefore, important points ot 



of favor and endearment, 
best advant^e; and t 
dress. 

Tbe various ecclesiastical costumes, ibe common Spanish dress, and the costumes (A tbe 
provinces, give a lively appeaVance to a concourse in Madrid. The Catalan wears a velvet 
jacket, with silver buttons, and long pantaloons, from his shoulder to the ground ; and tbe 
Valencian, loose breeches of linen, reaching from the waist to the knee. He also' wears aloi^ 
sack, or maota, unlike the full cloak, in which he partially wraps himself. In Castile, tbe peas- 
ant wears a black-velvet cap, which exposes bis high, manly forehead. He wears, also, a jacket 
of black sheepskin, with the wool outward ; light breeches, sustained by a girdle about his 
waist ; gaiters of embroidered leather, and siout, nail-shod shoes. In the north, the red woolen 
cap is common, which hangs partly down the back. ' In La Mancha, the tall montero cap li 
worn ; and in the south, the low-crowned Andalusian hat, with the wide rim turned up. 

9. Language. Tbe Castilian is so widely spread over Spain and tbe colonies, that it is 
called the Spanish language. But in Catalonia and Valencia, the Provencal language is gen- 
eral ; and in Biscay, the Basque, a harsher dialect. The Spanish language is rich and soao^ 
ous, and admirably adapted lo poetry. It is founded on tbe Latin, which is better preserved 

I m II tnan .n the Italian. It is mixed with tbe Teutonic and the Arabic. The approved pro- 
nunciation, is that of Castile. 

10. Manner of Building. There are noble edifices of Roman, Gothic, and Arabic archi- 
tecture, which are mentioned under the head of towns. There is some variauon in buildiog, 
in the different kingdoms ; but the general form of bouses is a quadrangle, with flat roofs, aod 
an area in the middle, surrounded with colonnades, or galleries. In the cenure, is often a tree, 
or a fountain ;. and in summer, a canopy is drawn over the top, and kept wet, to cool the air. 
Sometimes the lower windows have grates, or what the French call jalovsitB. There are feÂ« 
chimneys in the south, and the rooms are warmed by a brazier, or pan of charcoal. 

1 1 . Food and Drink. Tbe Spaniards delight in mixed dishes, in which there is no want of 
pepper or garlic. The olla, or paeheroj is a universal dish : it is a mixture of beef, chicken, 
,peas, other vegetables, garlic, and pepper. Pork is generally added, and it Is an article of food 
aq universal as in Mexico and Brazil. The Spaniard has a catholic pride, as well as a pleasure, 
'in eating it ; as it shows that he is no Jew. Chocolate is general, at breakfast, with a little 
"toast, or a roll, but neither milk nor cheese are much used. The bread is unrivaled ; it is niore 
'than a mere staff to support life ; it is so light and sweet, that it is better than cake elsewhere. 
In die markets, the fowls are cut up and sold in separate pieces ; and a row of wings, breasts, 
lega, &c., are hung together. This is to supply materials for the olla. Mutton is very gen- 
eral, and rabbits are more used than in other countries. Tbe food of the poor is meagre, ani' 
includes acorns and chestnuts. 



SPAIN. 196 

When a Spaniard giFOs a dinner, which is a rare occurrence, it is cooked jat the inn, and 
knives, forks, and dishes, are sent with it, for there is no large supply of these in Spanish houses. 
It \s not proper for a euest to accept, at once, so important an invitation. He repKes, by giv- 
ing ^^ a thousand thanks," which is declining respectfully. On the second asking, he says to 
his inviter, ^^ do not engage In such a concern ;" and it is only the third invitation, which he 
feels at liberty to accept. 

The wines of Spain are hardly inferior to those of France ; and if the best of them are un- 
known to commerce, it is only because they are raised in the interior of a country, that is with* 
out roads or canals. The wine most esteemed is the Valdepenas, raised in La Mancba ; hot 
the Sherry, the Malaga, and the wines of Catalonia, are more known out of Spain. The 
Sherry is a costly, but excellent wine. The wine is often kept in bags of skins, and these are 
iovariably the bottles. . The manner of drinking, is to throw back the head, and pour the liquet 
iato the mouth from a distance. One leg of the skin is prepared to be the mouth of the bottle 

12. Disases, Fevers are not uncommon, but there are few peculiar diseases. In the buÂ« 
mid province of the Asturias, leprosy is common, under various forms. Some of the lepers 
seem covered with white dust, like millers ; others are black. In some, one leg swells to an 
enormous size ; in others, the hand or face. In the Asturias, there are 20 hospitals for lepers. 
The remedy of Sangrado survive^ in spite of the satire of Le Sage, and bleeding is resorted 
to as a general remedy, and with little better success, than imder the administration of Gil Bias. 
The surgeons and physicians have little skill ; they are appointed by the manicipality of towns, 
so that there is no competition. The municipality is appointed by the king, so that physicians 
may be established against the will of the people. They have a fixed salary, which is generally 
paid by a tax on brandy. 

13. Traifeling. Spain is little visited by those who travel for health, or pleasure ; and 
Townsend makes it one of the requisites of a traveler here to have a good constitution. The 
Spaniards have no favors to foreigners, especially those of the Protestant religion ; and the 
roads are of the kind generally found in the infancy of civilization. There are but about 12 
good roads in Spain, but these are made upon the principle of McAdam, which has been fol- 
lowed there from time immemorial. The principal of these roads, are from Madrid to Bayonne, 
to Barcelona, tind to Seville. From Madrid to Toledo, a large city distant but about 100 
mfles, there is no road, and the route lies through fields, woods, and rocks. This want of 
iotemal communication is the bane of agriculture and industry, and the foe to all improvement. 
It however preserves the natural and local character unmixed and unaltered. On the prin- 
cipal roads the traveling by post is not disagreeable, nor is there anvthing in it worse thin in 
odier European countries, except greater danger from robbers. The diligences are found 
only on the principal roads ; and they are as good as the same vehicles in France. They are 
drawn by seven, eight, or nine mules, at the rate of seven miles an hour, and the muleteers 
are punctual and accommodating. Every mule has a name by which the muleteer addresses 
it, as Coronela, Arragonesa, &c. The chief muleteer is called Mayaraly and the postilion 
Zagal, The mules are obstinate to a proverb, and the Zagal has often full employment in 
beating them. He seats himself on one in the rear to belabor the other next before it. The 
amies are generally in good case and well used. The galtra or galley, as it is not unaptly 
called, is a long, covered wagon, for passengers and merchandise. The bottom is a net- 
work of ropes, which in some degree supplies the place of springs. On many routes there 
are no other modes of traveling, but on horseback, on mules, or the more humble animals 
called borricoi. 

In the Spanish language there are no less than six sounding words, to express the distinc- 
tions of public houses of several grades of accommodations. There is, however, little difi!er- 
ence between the best and worst, or rather, all are bad, and there are, not even in cities, any 
tolerable hotels. On many of the roads the inns are so unfurnished, that the regular answer 
to the question for dinner is, we can give you ^^ what you have brought with you." At no 
ion is the traveler welcomed by either host or servant ; no one asks his wants, or shows him 
Hito the house. He is left to grope his way into the kitchen, where, if he is cold, he may 
join the circle of muleteers, standing around the fire, and if hungry, he will not ^ be served so 
veD, or so soon, as these regular customers of the host. The hall is chiefly used as the 
ileepioe-room, and the beds are arranged arotmd it. In some provinces there is a tariff of 
prices fixed by law, together with an allowance for th0 ruido dtUa casa, ^^ noise of the house," 
ar attendance The mice of a slight breakfast of chocolate and bread is thus fixed at two reals. 



196 SPAIN. 

For a late and more substantial breakfast, like the French dejeuner a la fourchette^ eigbt reab 
s charged, and for dinner, twelve reals. The provisions, or equivalents, are specified. Tb 
dinner, it is ordered, shall consist in a soup, an olla of fowl, bacon, beef, sausage, beaos, and 
pot herbs, a fritter, or ham and eggs, two dishes of chopped meats, a pudding, peppers, bari 
cots, or beans, a roast, a salad, a dessert of three dishes, a glass of brandy, and bread and wine 
^^ at discretion.'' The bed is four reals, and must consist of a mattress of straw, and another 
of wool, two clean sheets, two pillows, a quilt, and a blanket. 

/ The traveler in Spain may have, from one end of the land to the other, the feeling of dignity, 
that danger is said to bestow ; for there is no part free from robbers. They do not often 
murder unless they are resisted, yet the traveler on whom they find little to plunder, seldom 
escapes without a severe beating. It is, therefore, not uncommon to carry a silver watch of 
small value, and a few dollars in silver, to be surrendered as a peace-ofTenng ; this is one of 
the usual expenses of the road ; and the rest of the money is taken in drafts. On the receipts 
that are given at some of the diligence ofiices, a caution is indorsed, that the traveler sbouM 
not take too much money, on penalty of being answerable for any consequent damage done to 
the diligence by robbers. There are often guards to ihe diligences, but they have sometimes 
an understanding with the robbers, and the danger of the traveler is thought to be in proportion 
to the strength of his escort. Some diligences compound with the robbers, who are some- 
times well known, by paying black mail, (or security. The robber, who has followed for jeers 
his trade of violence, is, it may be, a dweller in some hamlet, where men know more of his 
trade than they will testify ; sometimes when outlawed, he surrenders himself upon pardon, 
and becomes a trusty guard to the diligence. The ^' Young American " had, in his single 
^^ Year in Spain," the chance to be twice robbed ; once by such gallant cavaliers, that they 
scorned to touch the lady's baggage, and again by miscreants so hardened, that they murdered 
the muleteers, probably {)ecause they belonged to the same village with themselves. In the 
dangerous defiles, crosses are erected close together, each marking the place of a murder, 
and bearing the inscription, ^' here they killed John, Thomas," &c. The established formuh 
of the robbers is to call to each passenger '* a iierra ladron^^^ '* on the ground, you thief" ; 
where the sufferers lie quietly on their faces, while they are pillaged. 

14. Character J Manners^ and Customs, For centuries there has been little change in die 
Spanish character, and every inlet to innovation or improvement is closed. There is a say- 
ing, that Adam returned to the earth, where he recognised no country but Spain. ^^ Ah, this," 
said he, ^^ is exactly as I left it." There is a tradition too, in Spain, that he was king of ibe 
country, and that his capital was Toledo. 

The Spaniards are an honorable race, and in Spain the spirit of chivalry is not exuoct, 
though the institutions have passed away. The national songs and ballads, and the popular 
romances of chivalry, but particularly the former, have a great influence iti forming the char- 
acter ; they are sung by all ; they are of high poetic excellence, and rich in the sentiments 
that incite a Spaniard to die for his mistress, his country, or bis faith. 

Pride and courtesy are inseparable from a Spaniard ; but it is not the pride of an English- 
man ; it is the accompaniment of a lofty character, in which meanness cannot exist. He is 
not deceitful, for falsehood is a part of meanness or fear, and he has neither. His individual 
self-respect is associated with a pride for his country ; ^^ we are not all old Castiltans," is bis 
saying, when he would reprehend an act of baseness in another. It is not without some rea- 
son, that he boasts of his provinces, where all are nobles, or gentlemen. The very peasants 
have great independence of spirit, and dignity of manner; and, though they readily admit 
equality, they acknowledge no superiority. The poorest laborer seems to think, that fortune 
only has depressed him from his proper station, and he raises his soul above his bumble con- 
dition ; '^ as good a gentleman as the king, only not so rich," is the national proverb. But 
the proudest Spaniard exacts no greater tribute than he is ready to pay. Thp courteous Don 
of Cervantes was in this, and other respects, a picture of his countrymen ; puoctiliotn in 
rendering courtesy, and strict in exacting it. There is much of the national character embodi- 
ed in Don Quixote and bis Squire ; and this chivalric phase of madness, is probable and 
natural in Spain, though it would not be so in any other country. 

The humblest person in Spain, will take offence to be addressed under a lower title tbao 
Senor or Maestro. No circumstances or reverses can deprive a Spaniard of bis dignity of 
carriage. The very beggars are so easily repulsed, that th^ seldom repeat a solicitation. 
The characteristic reply of a mendicant, who was advised to work, was, ^^ I asked your cbâ€¢^ 



SPAIN. 197 

Hj^ Sir, and oot your counsel." The Spaoiards are slow to change ; and the want of roads 
prerents innovation. It is well for the people, that, under every disadvantage, they have 
reuiaed so much of their ancient character ; they have fallen from their high estate, and they 
iiave fallen upon evil times, but they are still the same invmcible, inflexible race with their 
ancestors, of the age of Cortez and Pizarro. A thousand heroic incidents in the Guerilla 
warfare, and the glorious defence of Saragossa, were outbreaks of the national spirit. Indi- 
v/dualty, though not collectively, the Spaniards still resemble their ancestors of Arragon, who 
promised their king to obey, if he would protect their rights, ^^ and, if not, â€” - not;" y si nay â€” 

90. 

The Spaniards are distinguished for good faith. One of their kings, who wished to confis- 
cate French property, published an edict, giving half to the factors who would inform ; but in 
all Spain there was not found one dishonest but the king, or who, when thus tempted, would 
betray bis correspoipdent. Oppression has debased the Spaniards less than superstition. The 
king couM not for a day oppress the subjects which it is bis duty to protect, but for the aid 
of the clergy, whose influence over the people commences at childhood, and ends only with 
life. The clergy, though ignorant, have yet the instinct of ignorance, and perceive, that their 
power would be reduced in a people brought up in knowledge and virtue. Every effort of 
genius is therefore discouraged, for philosophy is no friend to fanaticism, and poetry has noble 
aspirations. The schools are in ecclesiastical hands, and the confessional gives even a greater 
ioflueoce to the clergy. To a priest no door is closed, and no secret is hidden. The big- 
otry of the Spaniards is, unfortunately, beyond all parallel, and some of the effects of it will 
h% describeci under the head of religion. 

The Spaniards have an hereditary contempt for trade, and agriculture cannot flourish in a 
oouDtry without roads. There are few chances, then, that labor will have its reward ; the 
religious holidays are numerous, and thus a people of great energy of character, and an ardent 
temperament, have little employment, and no resource from ennui but in pleasure, or frivolous 
amosements. Their very virtues are politically oppressed, while their vices may lead them 
to honor and preferment. To be honest and true, to express their opinions boldly and freely, 
will but lead to captivity or banishment ;. but to dissemble in religion, to feign bigotry if they 
have it not, to show outward reverence to friars whom they may despise in their hearts, is tli6 
BMicb traveled road to safety and shame. There are, indeed, many who neither reverence a 
dissolute monk, nor honor a fanatic and faithless king ; but they conceal their sentiments, as 
they love liberty and life. The Spaniards have been called indolent, but it is a caluomy ; and 
ret many of them live in idleness ; for few men will much care to sow, where they may not 
â€¢e sure to reap. Pleasure, then, is a pursuit, especially amoiig the higher classes, and the 
eoosequences are indeed lamentable. Jealousy, which our romances have represented as the 

Esion of a Spaniard, is unknown, or it exists only between the matron and her eorUjo, The 
irty of married feniales has no limit but their own discretion, a frail barrier agabst a defec- 
tive education, a pernicious custom, and an ardent temperament. This evil is deplorable ; for 
the Spanish feaiales are, in many respects, worthy of admiration ; and when they have the ad- 
rtntage of a correct training, and indeed often when they have not, they prove themselves, 
koth as wives and mothers, worthy of a fellowship with Portia and Cornelia. They are gen- 
erous, vebeaieDt, and self-devoted ; they love like Othello, <^ not wisely, but too well." They 
hne all the elements of a great character, and under favorable circumstances, there are no 
vomeo that walk through the world by the side of man, to cheer him in sorrow, and excite 
him to duty and honor, that are c'omparable with the dames of Spain. The gallantry of a 
Spaniard is proverbial ; his salutation to a lady is, ^^ Madam, I am at your feet," and his 
wbote bearing to her is one of deference, humility, and devotedness. 

In Spain, those whose duty it is to be the censors and conservators of public morals, are the 
cofrepters. The flock is indeed unhappy, when the shepherd has an understanding with the 
votf. The celibacy of the clergy has made them dissolute, and they have spread depravity 
over the land. Of aU classes in the country, perhaps that which has the least pretensions to punQr 
is the clergy. Ferdinand would not sign a warrant for the execution of an ecclesiastic. It is 
bat a few years since, that a priest, who had conceived a passion for a lady that was contracted 
to another, murdered her at the confessional. The ferocious wretch, who afterwards expressed 
1^ Joy, that another should net possess her, was punished by an easy imprisonment. 

The Spaniards, with all their ardor of character, are perhaps the most temperate people in 
Barope ; and a traveler may pass through Spain and not see one intoxicated. They have, 



19* WADC. 

uafdnubately, less coatrcS over [Assiod than appetite. They are irascible md viadictire, tiodi 
froin Umperameat and climate ; it is said, that during the prevalence of a cerlaio wind, whicb ii 
peculiarly disagreeable, tlie numbercf murders is increased. Where the laws do act secure justice 
to etrery individual, men become both their own protectors and avengers It is not uncommoa 
in Spain to see men armed with guns, to protect tbeir property and persons ; and long clasped 
knives ere almost universal. It is with these, that so many murders are committed. In 1836, 
there ffere 1,233 convictions for murder, 1,775 foratlempts to murder, and 1,620 Tor robbery, 
wbile the actual crimes were perhaps many more tbsn the convictions. At Seville, is a hos- 
pital for the relief of such as are wounded in sudden frays, or by assassins ; the seat on which 
ibe patient is placed is called the " bully's chair." A traveller relates, that in one week of 
his residence, 31 were carried to this hospital, exclusive, probably, of those who were killed 
outright, or who had homes of their own. The murders are the most Irequent in the soath of 
Spain. 

It is needfVil to remark, that the foregoing descriptioa of the Spanish character is very gen- 
eral, and that, in the various provinces, there is as much difference as among different nstioos. 
The Andalusiaos are cheerful, yet boastful and irascible. The Valencians are light, cheerful, 
and vindictive ; and the hired ruffians and assassins, that were formerly corrnnon, came prin- 
cipally from Valencia. The Catalans are independent and laborious ; the Murcians, indolent 
aiui superstitious ; the Castilians grave, jusi, and honorable ; and the people of Biscay, T(i- 
varre, and Arragon, are independent, frugal, and attached to liberty. 

The aspect of social life is widely different in France and Spain ; tneprmcipalof tbesociil 
meetings m Spain are the evening tertulias, where the lady of the bouse receives a few r^niit 
visiters. It is to the lady, that m visits are paid, and the visiter may go many times without 
making the acquaintance of the husband. There is little of country life, like that of the eeoKy 
tn England. The few grandees, however, who lire in the country, are upon terms u greu 
femiharity with the peasantry. The Spaniards have few of the observances of hoemiality, tbtf 
are getiersl in the nonh of Europe ; they seldom invite a stranger even to dine. They, how- 
ever, say to him, that their houses, and everything they contain, are his ; and having been thai 
introduced, be may always call without ceremony, aa& enter without sending io his nime. 
When a person knocks at a door, it is demanded from within, " who is there ^ " to which ifa* 
established reply is gentt de pax, or *' peaceful people." Peasants and beggars call at tfaa 
doors, An Maria, lo which the reply from within is rin ptcado caneefrufa. This b a geneiri 
formula in several parts of Spain. 

]&. Ammtmtnts. The SpBatsh amusements are peculiar. The Spmiards are the gnreit 
people in Europe, except the Turks, and public dancing is, in Spain as in Turkey, a favorite 
amusement. The Spaniards, however, dance with much grace and snitBation in their social 
circle, which the Turks consider disgraceful. But it is the holtro Or famdtmgo, whicb is tbs 
great national dance ; and (be influence of it over a Spaniard is marvelous. It has beep 
supposed, that, should the bolero be struck up in courts or churches, the very iudge* and cler^ 
could ttot retrain from joining In the general taranti^ excitement. The bolero is, in fact, i 
new edition of the fandango, in which the exceptionable parts ere omitted, but all the graceful- 
ness Is retained. It is danced with castanets, and the Spaniards are indebted to lbs Moorafor 
it. It is performed by two persons, who stand opposite each other ; and advance, retreat, 
and pttfsue. The femttle files, like Gelstea, to the willows, that she may be pursued. There 
is a ruinous degree of gaming io Spain, anil tbt 
government furnishes the aliment by its lotieries. 
The tickets are hawked about the streets by the 

. blind, who are supposed to attract to them tba 

' favor of fortune. 

' The bull-fights are derived from the Romaos ; 

I and there are several ancient amphitheatres exiwii 

! of great magnificence. This barbarous amuse- 
ment has a deeper hold upon the Spaniard than 

I the bolero or gaming. The arrival of a "bull- 

I day " convulses the whole city ; and denÂ«8 

crowds collect around the arena, too poor Io 

pay for admission, but loo eealpus altogeib- 

er to relinquish the arousemeM. Tbey lean

more Lappy spectators. The bull-feasts are often dedicated to St. John and tbe Virgin ; and 
the gains are bestowed in charities. The fights are held only in summer, as the arenas are 
open, and the bull has then the greater courage. The worst places in the arena cost 2 or 4 
reals, and the best a dollar. In some places, as in Valladolid, the public square is the imposing 
arena; the streets are shut, and balconies are erected along the houses. After a procession of 
all the corabatanis, who are to engage the bull, 2 alguazils advance, with great gravity, to the 
president, to ask permission for the sports to begin. The arena is then cleared, and the door 
M thrown open lor the bull to come forth, when he is received with deafening shouts. He 
advances to the centre, and stands amazed. He has little time, however, leU for wonder. 
The picadoresj combatants on horseback, wait for him with their long lances. Theirs is a 
service of danger, though so little disgraceful, that the grandees have followed it. Sometimes 
the hull darts upon them ; at others, it is necessary to excite him to rage. He braves the 
wounds of the lance in bis neck, and attacks the innocent horse, who still continues the com- 
bat, though be may be gored so dreadfully, that he treads upon his own .entrails. The horse 
and rider are often overthrown, when the combatants on foot divert the bull's attention, by 
shaking before him pieces of colored cloth. Sometimes, however, tbe animal pursues them, 
and then they require tbe best of their speed ; they leap the barrier, 6 feet in height, but a 
moment before the bull dashes his horns against it. So narrow are their escapes, that Town- 
send thought, that the men actually raised themselves on the horns of tbe bull. The animd 
often attempts to clear the barrier, and he sometimes succeeds. This is tbe signal for speedy 
retreat to the spectators, some of whom, however, have been killed. Sometimes several 
horses are killed beneath the same rider. 

The next act in the tragedy, is commenced by the banderilUroSj who go before tbe bull, and 
when be plunges at them, step a little aside, and stick into his neck little darts, having fukm- 
oating powders, which explode, and drive the persecuted animal to frenzy. This is a danger- 
ous part to perform, as the horn of the bull, in his plunges, passes wi4|iii a few inches of tbe 
honderUleroU breast. Exhausted, at length, by the loss of the blood, that streams from na- 
merous wounds, the last moment of the brave animal approaches, for the hard laws of the circus 
are, that he shall not go forth alive. 

The president gives tbe signal for death, and the matador advances with a long dagger in 
one band, and in the other a flag, which he waves before his adversary. Both stop ana gate 
several minutes at each other, and the concourse are silent as the grave. The fight is now to 
become a smgle combat, in which one party, at least, must die. The animal recalls his ener- 
gies, makes a last desperate plunge at the matador, who steps lightly aside, and strikes his dag- 
ger into his adversary's neck, with so true an aim, that the spine is divided, and the animal bus 
bleeding upon his knees. Tlie circus swims before his glazing eyes, and he falls dead, 

^ Ere oemied the inhamaii shout, that hailed the wretch who won.** 

(6. Education* There are few establishments in Spain, for the difiusion of the first rudi- 
ments of knowledge. The lower classes seldom learn to read and write ; and those above 
them, are as seldom instructed in anything but reading, writmg, and arithmetic. Those who 
are designed for the learned professions, attend a Latin school for 3 or 4 years ; but classical 
literature has made Tittle or no progress, and Greek has been for several centuries almost un- 
known in Spain. There are 8 universities, but they are very far behind the literary institu- 
tions of other European countries. There has been little encouragement for education, or 
e?en safety for learning, in a country, of which it has been truly remarked, that to learn the 
names of its best scholars and finest geniuses, we need only to go to the dungeons of the In- 
<^msition. There are many associations, called learned societies. There are 12 public libra- 
nes, besides those belonging to the monasteries. There are botanic gardens at Madrid, Cadiz, 
Cartagena, and St. Lucar ; a cabinet of natural history, coins, and antiquities, at Madrid ; and 
leveral ol^rvatories, as at Madrid, Ferrol, be. So long as the monks controled everthing, il 
was their policy to spread among the people nothing but ridioulou$ legends, calculated to increase 
dieir superstition. 

Under tbe same rule the newspapers were equally barren. There were But verpr few, and 
(hose small. But since tbe accession of the young queen, and the political revolutions which 
htie folk>wed that event, matters in this respect are much changed. Newspapers have

17. State of the JlrtSy ScienceSy and LUerature. In the time of the troubadours, and in the 
middle ages, there arose, in Spain, a profusion of ballads and songs. Of the ballads concerih 
ing Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar, or the Cid, alone, there are about a hundred. After the conquesi 
of Naples, the introduction of the Italian literature gave a better form to the literature of 
Spain. Spain has never produced an epic poet of much eminence. The drama is exceed* 
ingly rich, tliough irregular ; it is a mine, to which the writers of other nations have freely reÂ« 
sorted. The Spanish division of the drama is peculiar ; it is not into tragedy and comedy, 
but into plays divine and human. The former, includes legends of the saints, &c. The 
btter, includes historical or heroical plays, comedies <^ of the cloak and sword," founded on 
tue intrigues of high life, and other comedies, in which the characters are rogues, pickpockets, 
and their ladies. Lope de Vega excelled in all these, and his principal plays are contained in 
no less than 25 volumes. But Don Pedro Calderon de la Barca, is the boast of the Spaoish 
theatre. He wrote 127 dramas, besides an incredible number of smaller pieces. There are 
a great many of the romances of chivalry ; and one novel, ridiculing them, has pervaded the 
worlds Don Quixote is unrivaled in wit, philosophy, and the painting of human life and cha^ 
acter. There are few writers at the present day, and the sciences are almost entirely neglect- 
ed. Natural philosophy, chemistry, and mathematics, are, in Spain, centuries in arrear. 

The Moors, in Spain, were so polished and gentle a people, that their expulsion was a na- 
tional calamity. They had a library at Cordova, of 600,000 volumes, and there were 70 pub- 
lic libraries in the Andalusian kingdom. This was at a time, when the rest of Europe was 
sunk in the deepest ignorance, ftlany Spanish Jews, of great learning, flourished at the same 
time. 

Painting has been more successfully cultivated, than the rest of the arts, and the Spanish 
school is much celebrated. Ribera, better known as Espanoleto, excelled in the most perfect 
representation of sufTeAngs and of sorrow, such as are furnished by the deadi of martyrs. Ve- 
lasquez was so excellent in portraits, that he is ranked with Titian and Vandyke. MuriDo, 
who never left Spain, is yet correct, and has great finish and warmth of coloring. Morales is 
called the divine, from the excellence of his beads of Christ. The Spaniards have a passion 
for music, and many, in all grades of life, perform on some instrument, generally the guitar. 

The national airs of Spain are numerous and beautiful, though her composers are few in 
number ; and the chief singers at Madrid are imported from Italy. The music of Spain pa^ 
takes of the character of her language, described, by a modern writer, as being *' grave and 
decent, like the dances of ancient chivalry." It is as pathetic as the Italian, but it has an en- 
ergy and romantic character, which the former has not. It speaks of a more mountainous 
country, of a more high-souled and chivalrous people. The Italian airs breathe of little bat 
of love. The songs of Spain are mingled with romance, devotion, and glory, as well as ten- 
derness. Music is not cultivated, as in Italy ; but it is the amusement of all ranks and condi- 
tions in Spain. The muleteer sings, to beguile the long hours as he speeds on bis way, and 
his rude carol is mingled with the wild jingling of the bells. The peasants sing, as they dance 
the seguidilla, to the sounds of the Castanet and guitar. The cavalier joins his voice to the 
music of his guitar, when he serenades his high-born beauty beneath her latticed window. 

The guitar is universally played by the Spaniards ; and suits well with the wild, romantic 
melody of the Spanish airs. The Moorish ballads, which remain, are mournful and tender, 
breathing the very spirit of gallantrv and impassioned devotion. The conquest of Granada, 
called forth all the musical strains of her minstrels, whether in lamentations over tbe fallen city, 
or in reproaches of the conquerors ; and the ballad entitled ^^ The Siege and Conquest of Al- 
hama," had sucb an effect, that it was forbidden to be sung by the Moors, on pain of dead), 
within the walls of Granada. 

18. Religion. The religion is strictly Roman Catholic* The number of archbisbofmes if 
eight, and tnere are fifty-one bishoprics. Tbe arcbb'ishop of Toledo, is primate of Spain, and 
his income was nearly $450,000. The ecclesiastics of all classes, including monks and nuns, 
were 188,625, but the number has been much diminished by tbe dissolution of the monasteries. 
The king nominates to all ecclesiastical dignities, and even to the smaller benefices. Tbe clergy 
are rich, ignorant, and dissolute. They were the most powerful body in all Spain, but their 
influence is diminishing. They retained a strong hold upon the favor of the lower class, by 
distribut'mg fix)m monasteries daily alms or food to tbe poor. Yet they gave back but a veiy

For the best of the cheer and the seat at the fire. 
Is the undenied right of the barefooted f^iar." 

Iq Spain, however, the clergy have greater privileges than those recounted in the song. 
They bold the power of superstition over ignorance, and make it the means of an immense 
refeoue. There is not in Spain a wretch so poor that he does not pay something to the 
church. The Bull of the Crusade is a document more generally sold than stamps are in Eng- 
lÂ«id. It is founded on a supposition, that there is a continual war waging with the infidels. 
The virtues of this bull expire at the end of a year, when it is necessary to purchase another. 
Oae half of the proceeds go to the king, and never was bigotry so well taxed, or an imposture 
isore cheerfully paid. This bull, among other things, concedes permission to eat eggs, milk,* 
and butter during Lent ; and no priest is so ignorant of his craft, that he will administer the 
sacraoient, or grant absolution to any one who has not the Bull of the Crusade. 

The Flesh Bull is more expensive, as it is intended chiefly for the rich, who are made to 
p^ roundly for eating flesh in the interdicted seasons. The Bull of the Dead is a passport 
required at all burials, and without it no priest will officiate. Marriages, christenings, absolu- 
tions, and funerals, swell the wealth of the church, and there is a profitable trade in masses* 
Those who die, pass their last hours ninder the eye of the church, and the ghostly advisers 
often suggest a bequest to the convent, to found a perpetual mass for the departing soul. The 
frieods ofvthe deceased readily purchase masses to shorten his abode in purgatory. Gener- 
ally, a Spaniard is very tender in this point, and n^ver refuses to give when solicited ^^ for the 
souk." Societies are formed in every town for these sufiering spirits, and there was a lottery 
scheme invented for them, in which the pious adventurer by performing the penance inscribed 
oa bis ticket, might transfer the merit of it to some soul in purgatory. The Pope has estab- 
lished certain days when every Spaniard may, bv kneeling at five different altars and^prayrog 
for the extinction of heresy, release the soul of a friend. The name of the soul must be 
meotioned, to prevent mistakes ; but, if not, the prayer is addressed ^^ for the most worthy 
aod the most disconsolate." 

The revenues of the clergy are swelled by the sale of relics, consecrated heads, crucifixes, 
scoaijes, &c. The relics are numerous ; generally the bones of saints. At Oviedo the 
highest church dignitary shows the rod of Moses, the mantle of Elias, the olive branch borne 
by the Saviour, a great part of the cross, eight thorns of the crown, a vial of the Virgin's 
lailk, and the hood she gave to the archbishop of Toledo. 

The Virgin Mary is the great Diana of the Spaniards, and alms are often solicited for the 
^^qaeen of heaven." Commercial partnerships are entered into, and a share of the profits set 
aside for her honor. An insurance company which entered into a partnership with several of 
the saints, had sufficient faith to insure a West India fleet in time of war, when insurance had 
beea declined in Holland at 50 per cent. The fleet was captured and the company broken. 
The ciost usual penances are flagellations, hair shirts, and bracelets, with points of wire on 
the inside. Every Friday there is a penitential scene in many of the churches. After an 
exhortation, the lights are suddenly extinguished, and every penitent scourges himself accord* 
iog to what he supposes to be his deserts. The silence is interrupted only by weeping and 
i^iog, and the blows of the scourge. 

Whenever the little bell is heard, which accompanies the host or sacrament going to the dy 
ieg, all who hear it kneel and utter a prayer. At theatres, balls, and in the mud of the streets, 
there is no exemption ; all who hear it, must remain kneeling till the sound is past, and to 
refuse would incur danger from the populace. The play stops, and the actors kneel upon the 
st^<s, as well as the audience in the boxes ; when, however, the sound is heard in bed, it is 
ody necessary to sit upright. 

The Inquisition has been so intimately connected with the religion of Spain, that we shall 
pve some account of the tribunal which punished thoughts with more severity than it is ever

(o a great degree, they resisted th^ introduction of the inquisition. They murdered the Bo* 
minicans, stoned the inquisitors, and stabbed them at the foot of the altars. There were such 
tumulis, that the whole power of the church and authority of the king were barely sufficient to 
restrain them. After Castile was united with Arragoo, by the marrii^e of Ferdinand and Isi- 
bella, the modem inquisition was established over Spain, from the year 1481. The king wu 
a bigot, but in this he had not even the excuse of bigotry ; he thirsted for the property 
of the Jews. It was a {Successful, and to him not an objectionable, way of filling the treas- 
ury. The gentle and good Isabella, the friend of Columbus, the protector of the Indians, 
refused to permit the inquisition to be established in Castile ; but her confessor, Torqueroada, 
overcame her scruples. The first destruction scattered by this infernal engine was among the 
Jews. A hundred thousand families emigrated, many professed Christianity, and almost all the 
new Christians began to emigrate to the lands of the Duke of Medina Sidonia, Marquis of Ca* 
diz, and other noblemen. Torquemada, however, the head of the inquisition, was too thirstj 
for blood, to let them so easily escape ; and it was declared, by proclamation of the holj 
office, that emigration should be held as sufficient proof of heresy. The proclamation ordered 
the noblemen before named to arrest the flying, and sequester their goods. The prisooen 
were more than the numerous convents could contain. Four days after the establishmeot of 
the inquisition in Spain, six of the condemned were burned, and ten more in a few days. 

In less than six months, 298 of these unfortunates were burnt at the stake in the single citj 
of Seville. During the same time, more than 2,000 of the condemned were delivered to the 
flames in other parts of the province. Among these were, of course, many persons of great 
wealth, and their riches only led them into danger. The prefect of Seville, to save time in 
the minfierous executions, erected without the city a scaflTolding of stone, on which were raised 
four hollow statues of plaster. In these, the newly relapsed Christians were slowly homed. 
This scaffold was extant until the revolution of 1820. 

Among the articles or laws of the inquisition, one decreed, that voluntary confessions 
should be written down in the presence of the inquisitors ; this enabled them to compel the 
confessor to denounce others whom he might suspect of heresy ; and thus this act of grace 
became an act of accusation. Another law made it necessary to ascertain the time of faliiag 
or relapsing into heresy, that it might be known what portion of goods belonged to the treasorj. 
Many of course lost the dowry of their wives, when these were paid after the heresy of tbeb 
fathers-in-law. The inquisitors were empowered to condemn all who had been reconciled, 
provided thoir repentance seemed pretended, so that life depended on opinion. Half proof 
subjected a man to the trial ; if, under torture, he confessed, and afterwards confirmed his con- 
fession, he was condemned ; if he retracted, he was subjected to a second torture. An entire 
copy of the testimony was never given to those accused. All persons summoned, and fiufiog 
to appear, were condemned. The conduct of a deceased person was examined, and when a 
posthumous conviction followed, the bones were dug up and burned, and the whole estate coo 
fiscated in the hands of the heirs. For a relapsed heretic, no promises of faith were stifBcient 
The inquisition never pardoned him ; and the only mercy allowed was to strangle him before be 
was burned. Many ofthese regulations were made to eratify the grasping disposition of the king, 
and the king, in return, was willing to barter his subjects' lives to the monks. The accosed 
never saw those who testified against him. There was the mockery of a counsel allowed, yet 
he was not permitted to be seen alone, or to speak but to confess. Besides, what counsellor 
would dare defend a prisoner in the inquisition ? Suspicion was divided into three classes ; 
and the prisoners were registered as lightly suspected, strongly suspected, and violently sos- 
pected. The light suspicion subjected its object to stand upon a scaffold with his head un- 
covered, to walk in the procession en chemise^ with bare feet and crossed arms, to be scourged 
by the bishop or rurate, to be stationed at the church gate till reconciled, and to carry on Us 
right breast two crosses of a color difierent from that of his dress. This penance lasted 3 
years for the first class, 5 for the second, and 7 for the third. 

The proceedings in these courts had little delay, though there were many long imprison 
ments ; when there was any process, it was a summary one. In one year, the inquisition of 
Toledo finished 3,327 trials. There were but two inquisitors and two roisters to perform 
this labor. When the tribunal had become well established, it had its spies all over Spaio. 
There was no safety, either in heresy or faith ; to have an enemy, or to have wealth, was dan- 
gerous to the best citizen and the most faithfu. Catholic. It was the reign of terror and sos*

fMoD ; die AomaoSj under Tx^erkis, were lets to be pitied tten the Spaniards, under Fwdioaotf 
mi Terquemada. it it a aatisfaction, however, to icnow, that the fanatic monk feit deeply what 
ke had deserved from the people. He lived in constant fear of death ; he bad always on bia 
iMe a oaieom's horn, to mtect the presence of poison ; and when he moved*, be was sur* 
raiinded by guards. He passed 18 years as Inquisitor-geoeral ; caused 10,230 persons to be 
horned, and 97,371, to be otherwise punished, and their estates confiscated. 

The prisons of the inqut^tion were so damp, that the mats and cloths soon decayed. The 
prisoners were literaHy crammed in them ; those wbo came forth were walking skeletons, whits 
ofbers confessed all they were charged with, to escape from such confinement by death. 

In the ekmmSer cftotmeht^ every person accus^, who refused to confess, received bis triaL 
Tliis was deep under the ground, ai>d lighted by two flickering flambeaux, which, with their 
onsteady light increased the gloom of the dungeons. The inquisitors and executioners were 
dothed in loeg robes of saokcloth, and their faces were covered with hoods of the same, bav* 
hg bbles cut for the ejFes. The poor suflTerer could not even Igok up in 'a human face, for a 
vtia search after mercy in its InMaments. The reAisal to confess was the signal for the torture. 
This was applied in three ways, by the cord, by fire, and by water. In the first mode, tbe 
hands were tied behind the back of the prisoner, by means of a qord passed over a pulley above 
his bead. He was raised by tbe cord as high as the roof, where he was permitted to hane for 
some tinne, when the rope was suddenly relaxed, and he fell within a foot and a half of the 
gteuttd. This dislocated ail the joints, and tbe cord entered to the sinews. This punishment 
WIS renewed every hour, till the sufl^rer was left without strength or motion ; when he was 
letnanded tÂ« his cell, to die or to revive for a punishment more horrible. In tl^ second trials 
the patient was stretched and tied on a wooden spout so contrived as to bend his back and 
nise his feet above bis bead ; this much impeded respiration. The executioner then 
iafredaced at the bottom of the rhroait a piece of fine linen, a part of which covered the nostrils ) 
ponred water into the mouth and nose, and left it to filter so slowly, that an hour passed before 
die sofierer cotJid swsNow a drop, ahtough it trickled constantly. There was no interval for 
MphttioR. He attempted constantly to swalfew, hoping to give passage to a little air, which 
tbe linen constantly prevented. Tbe linen was often, when taken from the throat, stained with 
the bkKMl of Â¥ess^ ruptiwed in this attempt to breathe. Besides this, at every moment a 
aowerful arm turned a lever, and made the cords on the arms and legs penetrate even to the 
nones. Fire was the next means employed to make the accnsed criminate himself. The feet 
were rubbed with oH and kird, and placed before the fire till they were so roasted, that the bones 
aad sinews appeared. Death was a relief, and confession gratified the inquisitors at last. Few 
ef tbe tortured ever returned to tell tbe hideous secrets of their prison. 

The condemned were executed at an Auto da fe, an Act of Faith, which was both general 
and particular. The former took phce on great occasions, as tbe accession of a Prince, his 
imrrii^e, or tbe birth of m Infanta. This was reserved as an offering worthy to be presented 
tn a king. A balcony of greet extent was erected, in which the seat of the grand inquisitor 
was placed above that of the king, who was surrounded by grandees and ladies of the court 

There was a long procession, ecclesiastic and lay, in which tbe prisoners came last, many of 
vhom were gagged. Tbe condemned were shut up m a pen, and each one knelt as bis' sen* 
tsnce was reed. The grand inquisitor then surrendered aM who were to be executed, to tbe 
secohf arm, aad they were conducted to the place of burning, or Quemadero. Here there 
were as many funeral piles as viethns. Napoleon suppressed the inquisilion, and Ferdinand 
revived it. Bnt public opinion had, even in Spain, become too strong for it to exist. In 
1830, when the popular outbreak restored tbe constitution, the people everywhere rose against 
the inquisition, forced the gates, delivered the prisoners, and demolished the dungeons and in* 
stmments of torture. The htstitcition is now at an end in Spain. From 1481 to 1820, the 
number of persons burned aKve was 34,658, and the number of others condemned to the galleys 
or hnprisonaient, 288,2 1 4. 

The dead are buried in Spain in the dress of a Franciscan or Dominican, with the hands 
holdiBg a crucifix ; childreia under seven years old are supposed to be taken at onc^ to heaveni 
â€¢nd their funerals are celebrated like joyful events, with festivity and the ringing of bells. 

19. O^vemmeni. Spain was long an absolute monarchy, in which the power of the king 
had no limits but the slender barrier that public opinion could, in a country without education 
or a press, interpose. The evils of this kind of government have, in Spain, been peculiarly 
iggravated by the individual character of the monarohs. Tlv title of Most Catholic Majesty 



204 SPAIN* 

which was granted by the Pope t6 Ferdinand in 1496, has been continued to the succeediDg 
sovereigns. In the king's title, are enumerated ail territories which he holds, or at any time 
has held. The heir apparent is called Prince of Asturias. The other royal children are 
called Infante* or Infanta. During the present century, several attempts have been made to 
revive the old carteSj or great council of the nation, once the most powerful of European legis* 
lative assemblies. In 1837, a new constitution was proclaimed, intended to meet the more 
liberal spirit of the present age. By this act, the Cortes, consisting of a senate, appointed bj 
tbe crown from a list nominated by the electors, and a congress of deputies chosen by the qud- 
i6ed electors, forms the legislature, and has the power of enacting laws with the royal sanction. 
The deputies are chosen for three years, and the senators for nine ; the crown, however, baa 
the right of dissolving the Cortes, and on each dissolution, one-third of the senators must be 
renewed. 

20. Laws. Either the spirit or administration of the laws must be defective, for neither life 
nor property is universally safe. There are several ancient codes, and the civil and caooa 
laws have some authority. Justice, in Spain, carries with it more terror than mercy ; and is 
avoided as a pestilence. It is now, as in the time of Gil Bias, perilous alike for the guillj 
and the innocent to enter its courts. When a murder is committed, all run from the dying 
victim, as they would from t^e murderer ; and when one is found murdered in a house, tbt 
very walls of the dwelling are stripped by the hungry followers of justice. One of the greatest 
obstacles to public and private justice is found in the notaries, or escribano^. A more efficient 
qrstem could hardly be devised for the obstruction of iustice. The notaries only, receive die 
testimonies of witnesses, putting what questions they will, and readnig such replies as roi^ the beat 
advance their own interest ; and often in the absence of the judge. The notaries are, there* 
ibre, sometimes bribed before the commission of the crime. The clergy often interfere, to 
obtain the pardon of an offender ; but when he has no friend among the notaries or clergy, the 
execution of justice is generally certain and severe. The manner of executing criminals is 
worthy the country where condemnation has so often been wrested from the groans of tbe in- 
oocent. Death is inflicted by the garotte^ which is an iron chau: with a collar fitting close 
about the neck ; this is tightened by a lever or screw, and causes instantaneous death. 

^Hanging by the neck is, however, the most infamous and tbe most common. The Verdugo, 
or hangman, is dressed in green, from an ultra catholic aversion to the sacred color of Mahonet. 
He posts himself on the second round of the ladder, while the criminal, with pinioned arms, is 
brought to the first. He grasps his victim under the arms, with an alacrity that shows his duty 
and his pleasure to be the same, till both arrive at the proper height, while a clergyman in sack* 
cloth, and girded with a scourge, follows closely, continually exhorting the criminal. The 
hangman places two cords of equal length over the shoulder of the shivering wretch, seats biro- 
self firmly about his neck, with his feet in the crossed wrists, as a stirrup, and both swing off 
and fall together. In this position, the Verdugo jumps up and down, while tbe assistants \m% 
upon the malefactor^s legs below. Thus die the patriots as well as the malefactors of Spain, 
and thus perished Riego. 

21. ArUiquiiiu. Spain abounds in the antiquities of three powerful nations ; of the Ro- 
mans, the Goths, and the Moors. As the remains are chiefly architectural, all but those of die 
Romans will be mentioned in the account of cities. The Roman antiquities are in good pres- 
ervation, and some of them are monuments of art. At Conifia, is a columnar pharos, with an 
bscription which somewhat confirms a tradition, that it was cmisecrated to Hercules by tbe 
Phcenicians, and afterwards* repaired by the Romans, who dedicated it to Mars. One half of 
the bridge over the Tormes, at Salamanca, was built by the Romans, the rest was made by 
Philip the Fourth. Segovia retains its Latin name, and it has a magnificent aqueduct, buikby 
Trajan. This has a double range of arcades, and it has conveyed water to the town for op* 
wards of 1,700 years. It has 109 arches, the largest 90 feet from the ground to the conduit, 
and the length of the space they cover is more than 2,530 feet. In Barcelona, are severd 
Roman remains. Near Villa Franca, is an ancient aqueduct, forming a line between two steep 
mountains.* Near Villanova, are the ruins of a fortress, and nunaerous sepulchres dug in the 
rocks. These indicate the site of Carthago Vetus, a town mentioned by Ptolemy. There is 
a triumphal arch beyond the town of Vendrell, and near Torre-dam-Barra, a magnificent tomb, 
which, according to a popidar tradition, contains the ashes of Scipio. At Tarragona, is anÂ« 
other Roman aqueduct still used to convey water. At Alcantara, there is a noble bridge over 
the Tagus, built by Trajan. It rises to the height of 211 feet 10 inches above the river ; its 



SPAIN. 905 

Ittigth IS 568 feet, aod its breadth, 27 feet 6 iocbes. Of the 6 arches, the 3 central ones are 94 
ieet wide. * There is an inscription in honor of the Emperor, and a mausoleum for the archi- 
tect, at the end of the bridge. It is built of stones enormously large, and is at present conse* 
crated as a chapel to St. Julian. In Merida, the Roman remains are litde inferior in number 
or bterest to those of the towns in Italj. There are 2 ancient bridges of great solidity, 
and in good preservation ; one has 60 arches, and extends 2,800 feet. Among the antiquities 
withifl the walls, are a fine triumphal arch, the ruins of temples, columns, inscriptions, &c. 
Without the walls, are a theatre, a naumachia, a circus, the remains of three aqueducts, and 
of foor Roman ways. There are many other antiquities, of inferior magnitude and interest, in 
various parts of Spain. 

22. nevenue, Debt^ Army, 8fc. The revenue of Spain was once the largest in Europe, but 
is now greatly reduced, not exceeding 35,000,000 dollars. The debt is 350,000,000, and is 
rapidly accumulating. The system of taxation b very defective, and varies according to the 
eiigencies of the government.* The army which is the main support of authority, is kept in 
{iretty good order, and amounts to nearly 100,000 men. The navy has dwindled away almost 
to nothing. 

23. CobwtM. The vast territories which formerly belonged to the Spanish crown in difierent 
parts of the world, were officially styled the Indies, and it was said without exaggeration, that 
upon its dominions the sun never set. But the only remains of thb colossal power, at xhm 
pcasent time, are the blands of Cuba and Porto Rico, in America ; the Canaries and the presi* 
dios or fortresses on the northern coast of Africa, of which Ceuta is the principal ; and the 
Pb'dlippine and Marianne or Ladrone islands, in Oceania. The entire population of these 
eokmies b about 4,500,000. 

24. Population. The number of inhabitants in Spain was estimated, in 1826, at 13,732,172* 
Of these 127,345 belonged to the clergy ; 100,732 were soldiers, and 14,064 sailors. The 
population has probably decreased since that time. It b now estimated at 12,000,000. 

25. BiHory. The early inhabitants of Spain were various Celtic tribes. The attempts of 
the Carthaginians to establish colonies in the country gave rise to the second Punic war with 
the Romans, which resulted in the acquisition of the whole peninsula by the Romans. It con* 
tinned a Roman province for 500 years. At the fall of the Roman empire, the Vandals, 
Alaoi, and Suevi invaded Spain ; and, in 419, the empire of the Visisoths was founded. In 
tbe early part of the 8th centii^y, the Saracens invaded the country irom Africa. Roderic, 
the last Gothic king, was defeated by them, at the batde of Xeres, and tbe Gothic inhabitants 
were driven into the mountains of Asturias and Biscay. The Moors established themselves 
b the southern part of the country, and their sovereigns reigned in great splendor at Granada. 
The Spaniards were roused to resistance by Don Pelayo, and maintained a struggle against 
tbe Moors, which the Spanish historians dignify with the name of a coptinual war of 700 
years. The territories gained from the enemy, were formed into several distinct kingdoms. 
These were gradually amalgamated ; and, in 1469, the marriage of Ferdinand, king oi Arra- 
gOQ, with Isabella, queen of Castile, united the whole of Christian Spain into one kingdom, 
rhese sovereigns conquered Granada, and completed the total subjugatio|^ of the Moorish 
power in the peninsula, at tbe same time that Columbus, under their auspices, discovered 
America, and gave them a new world in the west. 

In the 16th century, under Charles the Fifth, who was King of this country and Emperor 
of Germany, Spain was the most powerful monarchy in Europe. Philip the Second, the 
successor of this monarch, expelled all the MorUcots^ or descendants of the Moors, who re- 
mtiaed in the country, which caused an immense loss to the kingdom, in wealth and popula- 
tioo. The war of the Succession, in the early part of the 18th century, completed die im- 
poverishment of the country, and Spain has been only a second-rate power since that time. 

In 1808, Napdleon seized the kingdom, and placed his brother Joseph upon the throne ; 
bat tbe resistance of the people, who were assisted by the armies of Britain, and his reverses 
in Russia, frustrated his plans. This event caused the revolt of nearly all Spanish America

But the H0I7 Alliance eipreised iheir disapprobation. France ioierfered ; the constitutioD wu 
put down bV the bayonet, and despotism restored. On the death of Ferdinand the SeveDib, 
n 1833, his infant daughter, Isabella, was proclaimed queen, in compliance with the testainentuj 
direcUous of her father; but Carlos, or Charles, brother of the late king, laid claim 10 the 
crown, on the ground that, by the constitution of the Spanish monarchy, a woman could not 
succeed to the throne of Spain. The rival clainis of the uncle and niece led loÂ« long war, tni 
that war led to a revolution, by which the government has been changed to a limited mon- 
archy. But it still remains much under military rule, and has yet done but very tittle to 
i!9-e9teb)isb the pubUc prosperity. 

CHAPTER IX. PORTUGAU 



PIITBICAL GEOGEAPHT. 

1. Bomidaria and Extent. Portugal is bounded north and east by Spain, south and west 
bjr the Atlantic. It lies between 37Â° and 42Â° 11' N. latitude, and 6Â° 2(r and 9Â° 40* W. lon- 
gitude. It is 360 miles in length, and 150 in breadth, and conulns 35,400 square miles. 

3. Jtlountaitu. The mountains of Portugal are prolongations of the ranges we have already 
described in Spain. The Sitrra de Cintra is the extremity of the Iberian chain, and reacbei 
to the sea, a httle north of the mouth of the Tagus, where it forms the celebrated Rock of 
Cintra. The Sierra de Guadalupe extends to the sea at Cape St, Vincent. 

3. Rivers. The Duero rises in Spain, and passing into this country, takes the name vS 
DowOf and flowl into the sea at Oporto. The Tagvi passes from Spain throt^h Portugsl, to 
the sea, at Lisbon. The JHondego is a small stream, between the above rivers, which has the 
whole of its course in Portugal. The Mitiho forms part of the norlhem boundary, and tbe 
Gvadiana passes into tbe kingdom, and forms part of its southeastern limit. 

4. Cape$. Cape St. Fincent is a very prominent headland, forming the southeastern ex- 
trenuty of the kingdom ; it is the termination of one of the mountain ranges, already describ- 
ed. Capt Roca, a little to the north of the Tagus, is the extremity of another chain. It is 
a celebrated sea-mark, known to mariners as the " Rock of Lisbon." 

5. Climate. The climate is more agreeable and healthy than in the most of Spain. Tbe 
air of Lisbon is famed for its salubrity, and that city is resorted to by invalids from differept 
countries. The beat of summer, and cold of winter, are tempered by the neighboring ocpsd. 
At Lisbon, there are commonly 2Q0 days in the year completely fair. . The rainy days are not 
more than 80. When rain falls, it is very violent. If October is rainy, it is not uncommon 
to see the fruit-trees blossom anew in November. 

6. Soil. Portugal is a fertile country ; tbe soil is light, and easily cultivated. Tbe moua- 
tains ire mostly barren, but some of them are covered with a fine vegetation. 

7. JHinerah. The Romans had mioes in this country, ves^ges of which ara still to be

gold, silver, ud, lead, copper, iron, coal, quicksilver, rubies, hyacinth, beryl, manganese, bis* 
OMfth, aad arsenic. The salt is obtained from sea-water. 

8. Fact of the Country. This country has not so great a proportion of mountains as Spain* 
There are 2 extensive plaids ; that of Beira, in the north, and that of Alemtejo, in the south. 
The coast is low in the north, but grows high and rocky toward the south* In the wildness 
and grandeur of mountain scenery, Portugal is inferior to Spain^ yet in gieneral appearance, it 
if esteemed a more pleasant country. 



POUnCAL GÂ£OOBAPHT. 

1. Dimtom. Portugal is divided into 6 provinces, namely, â€” Entre Douro e Minho, 
Tras OS Montes, Beira, Estremadura, Aleratejo, and Algarve, which last has the title of a 
kii^dom. The population is estisiated at 3,400,000. 

2. Cities and Towns. Lisbon^ the capital, stands on the norjth bank of the Tagus, 10 miles 
Srom its mouth. It rises graduaUy from the water, and makes a magnificent appearance from 
without. The harbor, formed by the expansion of the river, is 9 miles wide, and is one of 
the finest havens in the world. The interior of the city, disappoints the expectation created 
hj the first view. It is ill built, with dirty, narrow, and crooked streets ; yet some parts, of 
modem construction, are not wanting in elegance. There are 13 large squares, the finest of 
which is the Praja do Commerico ; this is fronted by elegant buildings, and bordered, toward 
the river, bv the handsomest quays in Europe. In the centre, is an equestrian statue of Jo* 
seph the First. The cathedral is magnificent, and remarkable for the boldness of its dome. 
The Royal Hospital is an excellent institution, and there is a large foundling hospital. Lisbon 
has, also, 3 observatories, many colleges and academies, 180 churches and chapels, 75 con- 
veots, and a royal library of 80,000 volumes. But the most remarkable edifice which it con- 
tains, is the aaueduct of Bemfica. It is 10 miles in lengtb; some of its arches are 200 feet 
high and 100 leet wide. Altogether, this is one of the most magnificent structures, that have 
been erected in modem times, and is not inferior to any ancient work of the same kind. 
There are 3 royal palaces in Lisbon and the neighborhood, and around the city are between 6 
and 7 thousand qmntas^ or country houses. Population, 280,000.* Not far from Lisbon, is 
the rock or mountain of Cintra, which consists of towering pinnacles, composed of loose 
bk>cks of granite heaped together. Its environs exhibit the most beautiful scenery in the king* 
dom. Mafra^ on the western side of the mountain, is remarkable for a convent, church, and 
palace, adorned with painting and sculpture, and regarded as the most superb edifice in Portugal* 

Coimbra^ on the Mondego, is celebrated for its university. It has a delightful neighborhood, 
but die town is a dismal place F'ithin. Population, 15,000. On the Mondego, near the town, 
is the Qtttn/a dt kgrimasy or Louse of tears, where Inez de Castro was imprisoned and mur* 
dered. 

Oporto^ on the Douro, is an important seaport. Its harbor is excellent, and the town 
is strongly fortified by nature It has some fine squares and churches, but the houses gener- 
aDj are mean, and the streets narrow. It has a great trade in the exportation of oranges, lem- 
ons, and the wine called, from this place. Port wine. Population, 80,000. 

SetubtUy or, as it is improperly called bv seamen, St. ifbesy has an excellent harbor, and an 
extensive commerce. It exports wine, oil, and oranges, and particularly salt, of which a large 
quantity is made here. Population, 15,000. 

Braga is a commercial and manufacturing town, in the northern part of the country, with 
14,000 inhabitants. It contains an ancient cathedral, remarkable for its great size, and some 
remains of a Roman temple, amphitheatre, and aqueduct. 

LamtgOy in Beira, witn 9,000 inhabitants, and Santartmj in Estremadura, once the residence 
of the Portuguese kings, with 8,000 inhabitants, are places of historical interest. 

Ekas^ in the west, is a strongly fortified town. Population, 10,000. Here is a remarkable 



* Liiboii has been teiriblj desolated bj earthquakes. In 
17S6, the earth irembled, with intervals, for a jear. Ob 
the 1ft of November, a violent shock laid the city in ruins, 
h the lower part of the city, not a street could be traced 
^by the ftafmeDlB of broken walls. The cathedral (bll, 
^mr as immeiwe quantity of wealth in its rains. More 
thn too palaces, churches, and convents were rained, and 
tie property of all kinds destroyed is incalculable. During 
^ whole nxmth of November, the earth co n t iniad totrem^ 



ble two or thre^imes a day. A confla|rration added its de- 
structive ravages to that of the earthonake. The heifhti 
about Lisbon were covered with people escaped from the 
city, and their innumerable multitude of tents resembled 
the encampment of an army. Dead bodies lay onburied 
among the ruins, and others were dug out alive, afVer be* 
ing buried for several days. It is remarkable, that the 
great aqueduct, notwithstanding its enormous height and 



206 PORTUGAL 

aqueduct, which leads the water into an enonnous subterraoean cistera under the raapiiti ot 
the town. 

Evoruj to the east of Setubal, has many Roman remains, among which is a temple of DiÂ» 
ana, now concerted into public shambles. Population, 9,050. 

Leiria^ a litde to the north of Lisbon, is beautifully situated in the midst of a narrow vaDej, 
and has a famous annual fair. Population, 7,000. The convent of Batalha, 6 miles from this 
place, is one of the most remarkable Gothic structures in Europe. Mcoba^a^ 12 miles from 
this place, was the richest monastic establishment in the world ; the kitchen* is 100 feet in 
length, and is supplied with water by 8 fountains. Its domains comprised a tract of country 30 
miles by 15, containing 13 market towns and large villages, with 2 seaports, and as many fortresses. 

3. AgricuUwt. Portugal, though rich in natural productions, wants the cultivation of io- 
dustrious hands. The wealth of the colonies and commerce withdrew the attention of the io- 
habitants from agriculture, which has been for several centuries in a low state. Excellent fniit 
is raised and exported in considerable quantities, and several sorts of wines of excellent quality 
are produced ; the red Port wine is much drank in England and the United States. Although 
the country affords excellent pastures, grazing is litde attended to. Com is raised in so smaD 
quantities, that it is necessary to import it. 

4. Commerce, The want of roads discourages internal commerce ; there are no canals, and 
the navigable rivers are few, and often too low for boats. The foreign commerce, once ex- 
tensive and profitable, is now insignificant ; the troubles, revolutions, and civil wars that have 
distracted the country since 1820, have depressed every sort of industry. Manufactured 
goods are imported from Great Britain, and salted and dried fish from the United States. The 
exports are wine and fruit. The commerce is mostly carried on by British and American ves- 
sels. The annual exports amount to about 10,000,000 dollars. 

5. Manufactures, There are a few maniifactories of woolen cloth at Covilham, Portalegre, 
and Azeitao, and of hats and paper at Lisbon ; but they are not sufiicient for the supply of the 
country. Salt is made in the marshes upon the coast to the amount of 140,000 hogsheads annually. 

6. Fisheries. The rivers and coasts abound in fish similar to those of Spain. The fishe- 
ries employ 18,000 men, and are heavily taxed by the government. They are much less pro- 
ductive as a source of wealth, than formerly. 

7. Inhabitants, These have not for centuries been mixed ; they are well formed and slen- 
der, and dark in complexion. The females are distinguished for gracefulness. The privi- 
leged classes are the nobility and clergy ; after which, rank the traders and peasantry. The 
nobility seldom live on their estates ; but reside at court, where they hold all the offices. 
There are five orders of knighthood, with many commanderies, viz. the Order of Christ, of 
St. James, of Avis, of St. John, and of the Tower and Sword. 

8. Dress, The common mode of dress is similar to that of Spain, though among the higher 
classes the English or European dress is common. The ladies wear a black garment over a 
black petticoat, and at Lisbon cover the head and breast with a manto. The common class 
of females wear cloaks and petticoats of woolen, edged with ribands or gold lace ; women 
of all ranks wear many trinkets and jewels. Many of the common people still wear the an- 
cient habit, the petticoat and jacket. The fashion of dress is subject to little change, and mil- 
liners or mantau-makers do not thrive at Lisbon. 

9. Language, The language is somewhat similar to the Castilian, and has a few French 
and Arabic words. It is devoid of the guttural sounds so common in the Spanish ; yet its 
nasal terminations somewhat detract from its harmony. 

10. Manner of Building, There are few monuments of architecture, and the general man- 
ner of building is similar, though inferior, to t^at of Spain. 

11. Food and Drink, The Portuguese are temperate; the men do not generally drink 
wine, and the females never do ; little tobacco is used in any way. Bread, called broa^ made 
of Indian com, forms the principal food of the common people, and vegetables are much used. 
The wines of Portugal are sold under the direction of a company who mix them ; for which 
reason, those of the best quality can never be had pure. The port wines and the white wines 
are thus mixed. The wines of Setubal are of a good quality, both dry and sweet. Bucellas, 
near Lisbon, produces a delicate white wine resembling Barsac. 

12. Diseases. Fevers are not uncommon in many parts of Portugal. Rheumatism and pleu- 
risy are somewhat frequent in the north. The salt marshes of the coast produce dropsy and 
obstructions. The working classes, in some parts, are subject to a sort of leprosy. In the 
south, an inflammatory disease is occasioned by eatmg unripe figs 



POBTUGAL. i09 

13 Tirmeling, The traveler in Portugal is obliged, on many of the routes, to carry dl bis 
accommoclations with him, even beds, on sumpter mules, if he should be fastidious in point of 
lodging. The facilities for traveling are less than in Spain, though there is less danger from robbers. 

14. Character^ Manners^ &c. With some resemblance to the Spanish people, the Portu- 
guese have yet a great antipathy to them. The different ranks of society are as distinct as in 
cpain ; and the influence of the clergy is as great, and may be traced in the ignorance and 
bigotry of the people. The Portuguese are not particularly social ; but they are gentle, do- 
mesrtic, and foifd of retirement. Their character and customs are not liable to change ; trav- 
elers are few, and there is little intercommunication between different parts of the country. In 
the absence of improvement, the Portuguese are greatly bound to ancient ceremony and usage. 
No person, who regards his own dignity, would walk to make a call of ceremony on another ; 
and it would be an insult upon those he visits, to appear without a sword and chapeau, or with- 
ouc spurs to his boots. The peasants are civil, and salute everybody, by taking off their hats 
and saying, " the Lord preserve you many years." The common people have some peculiar 
traits of pride. They will draw, but not carry a burden. The Gallegos, however, are the 
eoinmon porters, and have no such scruples. The country is overrun with beggars, who are 
to the last degree importunate, and solicit as if demanding a right. The females are more se* 
eluded than in Spain, and seldom breathe the fresh air but in going to church. When married, 
ffaey retain their own names. All people are addressed by their Uhristian names. The useful 
arts are in a low state, and labor everywhere supplies the want of skill. All the implements 
of agriculture denote an unenlightened state of society. 

15. Amusements. Bull-fights, billiards, cards, and dice, are common amusements, and the 
guitar and fandango are general among the peasantry. The bull-fights are similar to those of 
Spain, except in a more adventurous practice of one of the players, whose part it is, when the 
animal plunges at him, to seize him by the horns, and to be thus carried round by the bull till 
bis comrades relieve him. 

16. Education, Education is in the lowest state. The task of teaching is imposed upon the 
monks, who are themselves grievously ignorant, and whose interest it is to keep others so. There 
is but one university, which is at Coimbra, and has a library of 60,000 volumes, and a good 
botanical garden. There is a small college at Evora ; also, at Lisbon, a college for the noÂ« 
bility ; and there are in the kingdom 800 elementary schools. 

IT. ArtSy Sciences J and Literature. The arts have hardly an existence in Portugal, and 
science and literature are much circumscribed. The literature consists chiefly in poetry, and 
excludes all philosophy. The very Latin partakes of the state of knowledge. The Latin of 
raooks is unintelligible to the learned. Little has been done in Portugal for the mathematics, 
though something has been effected for geography, natural history, and botany. The music is 
simple and sweet, and it is chiefly confined to songs. AlKthe best foreign works are prohib- 
ited, and everything published is subjected to a strict censorship. 

The principal dramatic writer was Gil Vicente, who preceded Lope de Vega and Calde- 
ron. But the great poet of Portugal is Camoens, whose Lusiad is well known beypnd the 
limits of the Portuguese language. Yet so little regard is paid to the memory of this great man, 
the brightest ornament of his country, that he has not a monumental inscription in the kingdom 
to remind the Portuguese of their former glory. His tomb was demolished a few years since, 
in repairing a church, and the spot where he lies is unknown ! 

IS. Religion. The strictest Roman Catholic religion is established in Portugal. The 
clergy are neither enlightened nor pure in life, and the force of their evil example is as perni- 
cious as that of the priests in Spain. There is a patriarch, subordinate to the Pope. There are 
3 archbishops and 15 bishops, and 4,262 parishes. Previous to 1834, when the religious houses 
were suppressed, and their property seized by the government, there were 360 convents and 140 
nunneries The number of the secular clergy is 22,000 ; that of monks was 5,800 ; of nuns, 
6,000. There was an order of friars " of Divine Providence," who trusted to Providence, and 
never went forth to beg. When in want of provisions, they sounded the alarm upon the con- 
vent bell, and supplies were poured in by the faithful. The mendicant orders were the most 
numerous, though much land was held by different convents. 

19. Government. The government, until 1838, was in effect an absolute monarchy, for the 
ooDstitutional charter of 1820 was but a dead letter, though the nominal provisions of it were 
liberal. In 1828, a new consitution was adopted, which has since undergone several chanties. 
After great disturbances and civil wars, the government has finally settled down into a limited 

27 



SIO 



rrALY 



monarchy, with a legislative assembly, but it still contiunes to be from time to time disturbed bj 
violent outbreaks, and is far from having attained to the order of regular constitutional monarcbjr. 
But nevertheless, the affairs of the country appear to be improving. 

20. Colonies. Even since the loss of Brazil, the colonial possessions of Portugal are exÂ« 
tensive and valuable. In Asia, she possesses Goa and Diu In Hindostan, Macao, and part of 
the island of Timor, forming together the viceroyalty of India, with 600,000 inhabitants. lo 
Africa, the Cape de Verd and Madeira islands ; the isle of St. Thomas and Prince's island, ia 
the Gulf of Gumea ; some factories in Senegambia ; Angola, on the western coast, and the gov- 
ernment of Mozambique, on the eastern, with about 1,400,000 inhabitants, are occupied or 
claimed by Portugal. The Azores also belong to Portugal. 

21 . History. The early history of Portugal is connected with that of Spain. Alphonsothe 
Sixth, king of Castile and Leon, bestowed this country upon Henry of Transtamare, a brother 
of the Duke of Burgundy, with the title of Count of Portugal, at the same time declaring the 
country independent of Castile. Henry's son, Alphonso the First, won a victory over the Moon, 
and was crowned king of Portugal by his soldiers, on the field of battle, in 11 39 ; Philip the 
Second of Spain conquered the kingdom and annexed it to his own crown in 1581 ; but the in- 
dependence of Portugal was restored in 1640. The kingdom was overrun by the French ar- 
mies in 1807, and the royal family fled to Brazil ; but the French evacuated it the following year. 
The usurpation of the crown by Don Miguel threw the affairs of Portugal into a state of great 
disorder, and was soon followed by a disastrous series of civil wars -and revolutions.

2. Mountains, The ^Ips occupy the northern and northwestern border. The Apennines 
extend through the whole peninsula, from the valley of Savona to the strait of Messina, sending 
off a branch to Otranto. They nowhere rise to the limit of perpetual ice, but are covered 
whh snow in winter, and are crowned to their summits with trees. The highest mountdns are 
Mount Corno^ or the Gran Sasso^ 9,520 feet, and Mont Velino^ 8,183 feet high. 

3. Rivers. The only large river is the Poy which drains nearly the whole of the northern 
part. Most of the other streams rise in the Apennines, whose vicinity to the sea on both sides 
prevents their having a long course. 

4. Islands and Seas, On the northeast, is an arm of the Mediterranean, called the â€¢Sdriatic 
5ea, or the Gulf of Venice. It is about 600 miles long, and 150 wide, and its narrow entrance 
is commanded by the island of Corfu. It has several good harbors, but in some parts the 
coast is dangerous. Its principal bays are the gulfs of Trieste and Manfredonia. To the 
soudieast of Italy, between Sicily and Greece, is the Ionian Ska^ which is connected by the 
strait or faro of Messina with the Sicilian Sea^ lying between Naples and Sicily, and contain- 
ing the Lipari Isles. The part of the sea between the islands of Corsica and Sardinia and the 
Tuscan shore, is often called the Tuscan or Tyrrhenian Sea^ and between Nice and Lucca is 
the Gulf of Genoa. The principal islands are Sicily ^ Sardinia^ and Corsica, To the south 
of Sicily is the Maltese group, comprising Malta^ Gozzo^ and CominOj and belbngingto Great 
Britain. 

5. Vegetation. There is a wide difference between the vegetation of northern and that of 
southern Italy, owing more to the increased height and breadth of the Apennines, than to the 
difference of latitude. The olive tree, however, reaches to the northern limits, and the pis- 
tachio {Pistacia lentiscus)^ pomegranate, Zizyphus vulgaris, Diospyros lotos, Celtis australis, 
and ostrya vulgaris, abound in the north, as well as in the south. The orange and lemon do 
not thrive north of Samnium, except in some favorable exposures near the coast. The plains 
and slopes of southern Italy produce olives, tamarisks, arbutus, myrtle, jujube, pistachios, 
and terebinths (Pistacia terebinthus) ^ oleander, sweet bay or laurel, carob (Ceratonia siliqua)^ 
the palmetto, rhanonus ; the stone pine (P. ptnea), whose picturesque outlines and dark hue 
have recommended it so much to the artist, that it forms a striking feature in almost all Claude 
Lorraine^s landscapes, manna ash, chestnut, mulberry, plane, willow, poplars, &c. The 
Apennines of this section are covered with oaks and cone-bearing ti^es, especially the 
common oak, cork oak (Quercus suber)^ yew, horse chestnut, larch, Scotch fir, pinaster, &c. 
The oaks continue also in the north, but the coniferous trees are scarce. In Sicily we find a 
tropical vegetation ; even the sugar-cane is cultivated, and the orange, citron, myrtle, laurel 
prickly fig (cactus tuna) date-palm, custard apple, pomegranate, &c., abound. Maize, millet, 
and rice, are common objects of cultivation throughout the country, and caper (capparis 
tpinota) is a valuable plant. The Arundo donax, a gigantic grass, of which fishing-rods and 
walking-sticks are made, is common. 

6. Animals. In the mountainous parts are found the lynx, the chamois, the wild goat, 
ferret, dormouse, lemming, and porcupine. There are many oxen called bufi^aloes, which 
are tamed in the southern parts. The Neapolitan horses are strong and well made ; the ass 
and mule are of an excellent kind, and the sheep are equal to the Spanish. Birds are numer- 
(HIS. Some of the reptiles of the south are common to Africa. The most noxious serpents 



8W ITALT. 

are (he asp and viper. The tarm 
(ula, or poisonous spider of the 
south, has been the subject of miaj 
fables ; its sling yields readil; lo 
difiereat remedies. The sev 
abound niih fish and molluscie. la 
the Guir of Taranto is found the 
shel. fish which affords the Tjriaa 
purple, 60 highly prized by the an- 
cients. In these seas also ibe 
Nautilus spreads its thin sail. 

7. Canah. It was ia-Italy, dut 
the great improvement of coDsinict- 
ing Iqcks and sluices in canals, so 
as lo pass boats from one level lo 
another, was first introduced. The 
t%* XiatilMi. canals of Italy are in part intended 

for purposes of irrigation, and in 

?art for navigation. The former are numerous in Sardinia, the Lombardo- Venetian kingdom, 
'uscany, and the northern part of the Papal dominions. Of the latter, the principal are the 
^(ttiglio Qrandt, from the upper part of the Ticino to Milan, which has been continued from 
Milan to Pavia by the Pavia Canal ; total length, 30 miles ; the Marttmna Canal, from 
Milan to the Adda, 24 miles ; the Pisa Canal, from Pisa to Leghorn ; (he Cento Canal, frora 
Bologna to Ferrara, 34 miles, whence it is continued to die main branch of the Po ; and the 
canal from Modena to the Panaro. 

8. Roadt. The mountain roads which connect France with Savoy, and Valais with Iialy, 
firom the difficulties overcome in their construction, and (he immense labor necessary in erect- 
ing bridges, excavating tunnels, &c., rank among the greatest productions of human energy aDtl 
art In modern times. The road over Mont Cenis, which was formerly passed only on mules, ot 
in sedans, is 30 miles long, and passable by carriages ; it rises lo the height of 6,775 feet. The 
road over the Simplon, from the Valais near Brieg, lo Piedmont near Arona, rises lo the 
height of nearly 7,000 feet, and passes through six galleries or tunnels hewn out of the rock ; 
one of these is 683 foel long. The road is 36 miles in length, and crosses many tremendons 
precipices by means of bridges. The road from Bormio, in the Valteline, over the Slelvio 
or Stilfeijoch, forms the communicailon between Innspruckand Milan, and is the highest road 
in Europe, reaching an elevation of upwards of 8,000 feet. Several olher Alpine roads have 
been constructed from France to Sardinia, and from the German into the Italian provinces of 
Austria. 

9. lnhahiianis. The Italians are descended from different nations, which, at various limes 
overran Italy, though they are now blended into one race. A few Greeks live on the coast 
of the Adriaiic ; there are Germans in Lombardy, Venice, &c., and Jews scattered over the 
country ; but ihere are not probably 200,000 inhabitants who are not Italians. The Iialiaos 
are distinguished for their animated and expressive countenances, and they have very brilliant 
eyes. They are generally of dark complexions, well formed, and active. The women have 
black or auburn haif, and most of the requisites for beauty. Among the inhabitants are many 
cripples and deformed ; for the poor in Italy suSer many hardships and privations ; but among 
tlie lowest class, and especially at Naples, the human form is seen in it^ greatest perfection, 
and the half-clad lazzaroni are ihe best modeb for s sculptor. 

In all ihe States of Italy there are the usual grades of European nobility ; and the individ- 
uals are more numerous than those of ibe same class in any other country. In some of the 
Slates of Ilaly alt the sons of the nobilily and their sons, bear the original title. Of course 
numbers are indigent ; and many of ihem are known to solicit charity. 

10. Dreu. The higher classes wear the common European dress. At Genoa, however, 
females of all ranks, wear very gracefully, the mn:zaro, a kind of shawl thrown over the bead 
and shoulders end folded round the arms. In Savoy ihe French fashions are generally fol- 
lowed by (he upper class ; bu( the common people all over Italy have their local peculiarities 
of dress. The fashions vary even in small districts or towns. The shepherds wear the skins 
of their Sock, with the wool outward in summer, and inward in winter. These gannenls are 



TTALT. afi) 

lade^ lomieti, and have Mnaeiiines only boles pierced for the bead and arms. In SuMlhih 
and Tuscany, the females have many ornanWBK 
of pearl, coral, and gold ; and even the poorest 
are rich in these. Id Tuscany the females of 
the common classes wear black heaver hais, wit}i 
high crowns, and stiff plumes of black feathers. 
On holydays they are streaming vrith ribands. 
At Naples the lazzaroni have gaudy bolyday 
dresses, but some of them may be seen lyiD| 
naked in the sun, and many have no othei 
covering than breeches that end above the knee. 
In the island of Procida, the females to this day 
wear the Greek costume, which, in that seques- 
tered nook, (hough within a few miles of Naples, 
has descended from their ancestors. 
Inkaikaaii Iff Mttitm Uaty. II. Language. The written language of 

Italy is uniform, though there are various dialects 
spoken in diilerent dislricts, and in Savoy the more general language is the French. The 
ItaliBa is founded on the Latin, which it nearly resembles, except in the articles end auxiliary 
verbs. AH foreign, or barbarous words, are said, by Muratari, not to exceed 1,000. Tfae 
tat^Bge is so sweet and liquid, that it is consecrated to music in all European countries ; yet, 
though soft to a great degree, it is distinguished for force, as will be allowed by all readers of 
Dmie. The language is spoken with the most purity at Rome, Sieua, and Florence ; but thÂ« 
Venetian dissect is the most musical. 

13. Manner of Building. In Italy, are the most splendid and perfect monuments of archt- 
tKtare. The churches are the most cosily and magnificent ; the monasteries capacious, sod 
the palaces unrivaled. Many of these latter, however, in the Venetian territory, though built 
by Palladio, sre suffered to decay, and some are razed, for the sake of the materials. Arclu- 
tecture, painting, sculpture, and other arts, are exhausted on the churches. Many of then 
bive a minuteness of finish, that is nothing less than wonderful. The pillars of some are en- 
ousted with mosaic pictures, or precious stones ; the nails covered with frescoes, and the 
doors inimitably carved in bronze. The gates of the Baptistery, at Florence, were pronounc- 
ed, by Michael Angelo, to be " worthy of Paradise " ; they are divided into compartments, and 
carved in brcHize, with scriptural histories. There is no part of the churches, that is not richly 
ornamented. The cities of Italy are all well built, and Genoa is named, from its palaces, 
"the superb." It is almost a city of palaces, many of which are very striking in effect. In 
Fktrence, the architecture is of a more solid character ; the indication of a time, when factions 
convulsed the city, and every house was designed to resist an assault, and stand a siege. 
There are few trindows, or columns, in the Tuscan palaces. Some of the chief buildings, 
have been for ages unfinished ; the Pitt! palace wants a wing ; the Cathedral is not completed, 
lod the vestibule of the Laureniian Library has still the scaffolding erected by M. Angelo. 
At Rome, many of the 300 churches are worthy of admiration, and one of ihem is the 
pestesl monument reared by the hand of man. The palaces are numerous and elegant. They 
ire generally quadrangles, with an area within, and a wide staircase of marble. The windows 
ue numerous. The palaces, however, seem to be designed as much for the spectator as the 
teaant ; and none of them are devised for the English principle of comfort. 

At Naples, the churches, though rich, are of an inferior architecture, but the palaces are 
imposing. The roofs are flat, and covered with a cement, that endures the climate. The 
roofs are terraces ; at some seasons the people sleep upon them ; and every window has a bal- 
eoay. At Rome and Naples, there are few chimneys ; the climate is so mild, that little fire 
is necessary. The ladies, however, have, in winter, a little vase of coals, which they place 
uoder their dress ; they call it a marito, or husband. The leaning towers, are one of the pecu- 
liarities of Italy. There are 2 at Bologna, side by side, overhanging the most populous part 
of the nity. One is slender, and 3.'>0 feel high. It was formerly 476, but was reduced, from 
nutian, after it had wiihstnod an eanhquake. It was erected A. D. 1110. The other is 130 
feet high, and 8 feet out of the perpendicular. At Padua, b a ball, built in the 13th century, 
*bich has withstood several earthquakes ; it is SOO feel long, 100 feet wide, and the same in 
beigfat. It is lai^er than Westminster Hall, yet the walls are insulated, and not strengthened 



814 ITALT. 

by abutments, or mutual bindiog of aoj sort. The Leaning Tower, at Pisa, is ebenbere d^ 
â€¢cribecf. _ 

13. Food and Drink. The food of the Italians is light ; neither the climate, oor the at- 
tional indolence, requires any other. Chestnuts are used, in manj parts, as food, made btoi 
heavy bread ; and, in several of the cities, roasted chestnuts are sold hot. They are 6 times 
as large as the same nuts in America. Potatoes are growing somewhat into use with the com- 
mon people. At Rome, pelenla, or hasty puddiug, made of the flour of Indian cora, is a 
general dish with the common people. Macaroni is a common Ibod only at Naples, nhere it 
IS both a luxury and a necessary. It is, however, much used over all Italy. It is a dried 
preparation of flour, in long tubes, which are boiled till they become swelled and soft, nbec 
they are eaten with a sprinkliog of grated parmesan cheese. It is, with tbe lazzaroni, the hap- 
piest time of their happy 24 hours, when their toil, tbeir tricks, or their importunity, have ob- 
tained a few grains, to purchase macaroni, which they hold in long vermiform strings, above 
tbe head, which is throwa back, and feed themselves, as it were, by a measure of lei^. 
Fruit and vegetables form conaiderable articles of food. Coflee is a common beverage, tod 
BO sbops are more frequent than coflee-rooms. A traveler is surprised to see a course of 
email birds on the table, not larger than wrens. They make a part of every dinner, in the 
south of Italy. 

The wines of Italy, in spite of the want of skill in making, are excellent. They are light, 
and reach their perfection in a year. The wines of Sicily are the most exported. The Mar- 
sala, or Sicily Madeira, made IVom the Madeira grape, is a strong white wine, and much ol it 
is consumed in the United States. The wines of Sardinia and Corsica, might, with care, be 
made of a superior quality ; and those of Tuscany are of established reputation. The Ale- 
atico is a red muscadine, and the best is produced at Montepulciano, in the Val de Nievoie, 
and in the Lucchese territory. The sweetness of the wine is tempered with an agreeable 
sharpness. At Artimino, is produced an excellent claret. The Verdea is a pleasant, white 
wine, made in the .vicinity of Florence ; and the Trebbiano is so sweet, that it is almost a 
syrgp. The Orvieto is a delicious table wine, and the best which is produced in the states of 
the church. Monteflascone, in llie vicinity of Orvieto, produces a most luscious Muscat wine. 
Tbe Neapolitan territory produces the Vino Greco, a sweet wine ; tbe Lacbryma ChiisU, 
sweet and luscious ; and a muscadine wine, very aromatic. The Gragnano, in an agreeable 
red wine, produced at Castellamare, in the vicinity of Pompeii. The Lacbryma ChrisU is 
raised in a soil, mixed with the lava, or ashes, of Vesuvius. All these wines are cheap ; foi 
the narrow policy of several of the governments imposes restrictions on exportation, and the 
inland transportation to the cities is not easy. The Italian wines seldom improve after a year. 
The domestic consumption of them is great, yet the Italians are as temperate, nearly, as liie 
Spaniards. The roso'glio, a cordial, is drank at Naples ; and various cordials in di&'ereiit 
places. 

14. TroBtling. Tbe most expeditious way of traveling, is by post ; which is somewhat 

cheaper than in France. Bui a common 
method is, to go with a vetturino, in a coach, 
containing â‚¬ or 8 persons. There is no waat 
of this conveyance on all the principal routes. 
It is cheap, and as the rate is but 30 or 40 
miles a day, affords ihe best opportunity of 
seeing the country. The vetturino looks 
out among foreigners for bis passengers, to 
each of whom he tenders a ducat in pledge, 
to be forfeited if he should fail to go-; but 
if the passenger should fail to be ready, be 
also forfeits bis ducat. The bargain widi 
the vetturino, generally includes the passage, 
and accommodations at the inns ; and this 
arrangement saves the traveler much over- 
HamuliidCnitringtke^lpt. charging and wrangling. The route from 

Rome to Naples, perhaps 1 50 miles, costs 
about 6 dollars, and the vetturino is held to furnish a supper of several courses, and a single bed- 
room, to each passenger. It is common, to make him sign a contract, specifying tbe particu 



ITALY. 21o 

kn; and to give bim a oeftaia sumy perhaps half a dollar, at the end of the jouraey, if he iiat 
been civil and obliging. The main roads are good, but the cross roads are hardly passable ; 
and ID Sicily there are hardly any interior roads. The custom-houses and the passports are 
great annoyances. The custom-houses are at the frontiers of the states, and at the entrance to 
cities ; the officers well know how to visit the traveler with manifold vexations, if he should 
fail to purchase their forbearance with a few pauls, generally less than half a dollar.. When 
this preliminary is adjusted, the traveler is permitted to pass with his baggage unopened. 
There is no escaping the Doganieri. '* They stop the chariot, and they board the barge." 
The vexations of the passports are of more frequent occurrence. The passport is taken at 
the gate of all considerable towns, carried to the commandant, endorsed and returned by a 
soldier, whose low bows are generally rewarded with a small coin. When a stranger resides 
in a city, he surrenders his passport and receives a written permission to remain for a certain 
time, and this must be renewed when the time has expired. Before quitting one independent 
State, to visit another, it is necessary to have the permission of the minister or consul of the 
State to which the traveler is going. These various endorsements and seals on a passport soon 
cover every part of it, and new paper must be added to it, which in time becomes a long roO. 

The inns are few of them good ; but generally on the main routes the accommodations are 
equal to those in France. The beds are almost universally good ; and the bedsteads are of 
iron, with a network of thin iron bands to support the bed. In cities, the hotels generally sup- 
ply only lodgings. A furnished room is let, and the occupier receives his meals from a trat- 
(eria, or goes to one himself. 

In Italy, which is cut up into so many States, with inefficient governments, robbery is or has 
been almost a profession, and committed on a scale unequaled, except in Spain. The robber, 
m Italy, seems to be shielded by popular favor, and he is celebrated in ballads. Fra Diavolo, 
of Itri, was renowned and feared beyond the limits of his country, and many other brigands 
have raised themselves to ^^ that bad eminence." The frontiers of the kingdom of Naples, 
beyond Terracina, were the most dangerous defiles for the traveler, who, if he failed to satisfy 
tbe robbers with sufficient plunder, was held to ransom himself by a draft on his banker ; and 
the brigands seldom omitted to keep their threat of murdering him when the draft was pro- 
tested. Not only travelers were thus seized, but wealthy residents ; tbe wife of one of these 
sent for ransom a sum less than that demanded, and received in return the captive's ears, with 
an intimation, that the knife would next be directed against his throat. The house of Lucien 
Bonaparte was robbed within 15 miles of Rome, and his secretary carried away and held to a 
ransom of several thousand ducats. It was intended to capture the prince himself, who hap- 
pened on that day to be absent. The weakness of the government is the strength of the bri- 
gands, though a^the present time the roads are generally safe. A cardinal, the secretary of 
state, was sent to Terracina, to confer with the robbers, and an offer of amnesty to all that 
would surrender, and suffer a limited imprisonment in the castle of St. Angelo, with a certain 
allowance or salary from the government. Some leaders, their wives, and many followers sur- 
rendered, but the government broke faith and held them after the stipulated time. While in 
prison they were much visited. They were a fine race of men, but hardened and ferocious. 
The wife of the chief was celebrated for beauty, and the little son went through the brigand 
exercises with his musket, for the amusement of visiters. Sicily was formerly impassable, by 
reason of robbers ; but when the English had possession, they introduced the code of Alfred, 
making districts answerable for crimes, and the success was so complete, that Sicily is not much 
infested with robbers, even now. 

Before closing this article, it is proper to mention some of the peculiarities of Italian trav- 
eling. In Sicily, where there are hardly any roads, the common conveyance is the lettiga^ a 
sort of sedan on long poles. It is carried by two mules, one before and one behind it, with 
the poles supported over their backs, like common shafts. At Naples, there is a small, but 
very spirited breed of horses, driven about at full speed in a little open chair, or caliche. The 
driver stands on a board behind, and holds his reins over the passengers' heads. There are 
seats but for two passengers ; but persons often cover the little carriage, holding on wherever 
tbej can find space to plant a foot. Eight or ten may be seen thus, carried swiftly by one 
horse. 

Sefore tbe present stupendous roads over the Alps were made, it was toilsome and danger- 
ous lo cross the mountains. Ii was the labor, without the glory, of Hannibal. The trav- 
eler, in going from Savoy, often descended the mountains to Lans le bourg, on a trainean or 



216 ITALY. 

akdgei guided by a mountaineer* la this way, two leagues were passed over io a far 
i&inuies. 

15. Dueaset. Some of the most fertile parts of Italy are depopulated by the fevers, that 
arise from liie maJana. The most extensive tnaremmay or marshy, low land, extends from the 
vicinity of Leghorn to Terracina, and few of the inhabitants remain in it during the summer. 
The Pontine Marshes, near Terracina, have been noted from remote antiquity for their pesti- 
lential vapors. It is fatal for the traveler to sleep on them for a night in summer ; and itig 
dangerous for him to fall asleep in his carriage by day. With every precaution, indeed, aod 
the greatest speed, it is not possible to pass them in summer without peril. The wasted 
inhabitants of these pestilential districts have the marks of disease imprinted deeply upon them. 
They are thin, livid, and unwilling to move. They have hard, protuberant waists, and sunken 
eyes. Jn some places, they pass their summer nights in the mpuntams, and a few come 
down by day to discharge their duties at the post houses. An ascent of ten minutes' 
walk up the mountains, places them in an air of perfect purity. The malaria seldom rises more 
than 200 feet. Where it prevails, the vegetation is often enchanting, all flowers open their 
petals, and every noble tree extends its branches. Yet the agent that produces all this veget* 
able beauty is fatal to human life, though, like the sword of Harmodius, the danger is concealed 
in flowers. Rome is more exposed to the ravages of the malaria than any other city. It b 
besieged, and the salubrious spots are annuaUy diminishing in extent ; 4,000 people die of ie* 
vers annually in the Roman hospitals, and 60,000 perish in Italy by the same scourge. Ostia, 
with buildings to contain many thousand people, has but 12 men remaining. 

Blindness and opthalmia are common in the south of Italy, and, in the mountains of the 
north, scrofula and goitres. A goitre is an enlargement of the glands of the neck, which some- 
times swell to such an extent, that they overhang the breast. In some districts among the 
Alps, few people escape an enlargement of the glands. A recent traveler in the Alps says, 
'^ In this route, we remarked a great many goitrous swellings ; some hanging hideously down 
like the bag of a pelican, and others just beginning to swell, like an alderman's double chiii. 
I never beheld one without raising a hand to my own neck, to see if all was ri^t ; and a pretty 
woman in these regions runs to a glass in the morning, (though our ladies do this,) to see if 
that foe to beauty has not appeared during the night. In some parts, however, it is said duit 
goitres are so common, that it is an unfortunate singularity to be without ooe, and a youi^ 
woman who is so unlucky can have few admirers." The goitres are not dangerous, nor, unless 
when very large, troublesome. Cretins, a peculiar kmd of idiots, are generally found io the 
same districts with goitres. 

16. Character^ Manners^ and Customs. Italy has a common language, literature, and re* 
ligion, but no common national character. There is no bond of union, no fe^ng of interest, 
or affinity, that binds one state of Italy to another. On the contrary, there is a reciprocal as* 
tipatby, a sort of moral centrifugal force, which has dropped the violence, though it has lost 
none of the intensity, of the feudal times. It is kept alive by sarcasms and proverbial sayings* 
and the inhabitants of neighboring towns have some general name of insidt for each other. 
These local divisions produce great acrimony, and they are fortified by local customs, dialects, 
and dress. This disunion of those who sh9uld be united, sufficiently accounts for the facility) 
with which the best part of Italy has admitted the domination of foreign masters. 

The revolutionary changes of 30 years, have, however, given an impulse to the public niiDdÂ» 
and they have raised the Italian character, especially in the north. In this part, there is an 
almost infinite moral distance between father and son ; there is the difference of centuries, 
between those who formed their character before the residence of the French, and those who 
formed it since. Such are the local character and divisions, that, to describe Italy truly, it 
should be described in detail ; for there are many traits of character, that do not pervade all 
the separate states. The enmity of petty states, is greater than that of empires ; for the 
jealousy partakes somewhat of personal dislike. In Italy, the minor states are ridiculed by 
the larger ones, and by each other ; it is an old jest of Punch, upon the stage, in ridicule ojf 
a small territory, to light a candle at both ends, when a petty duke orders him beyond his froor 
tiers, on pain of death, before the candle should be consumed. 

The modern Italians are the successors, rather than the descendants, of the Romans. Italy, 
says her poet, was cursed with the fatal gift of beauty, and she has ever been the spoil of the 
strongest. Clouds of barbarians have overrun her plains, and the original nadons became so 
blended with foreigners, that the lineage is no longer to be traced. Some few families^ indeed. 



ITALY. 917 

irith tn excusable pride pretend to trace their descent from the Romans ; and two there are 
who boast the blood of Fabius Maximus and Publicda. Heraldry, howevtr, is seldom Ttry 
precise. The Italians have ardent temperaments and poetic imaginations ; and they act more 
mm impulse or passion, than reflection or principle. No people who have Kved since the 
best days of Athens, have had so much perception as the Italians, for the beautiful. The first 
natural objects, that draw their eyes, are peculiar to their own beautiful country. The skies 
are so soft and clear, that it is said, proverbially, and almost without hyperbole, that the moon 
of Naples is brighter than the sun of England. Every distant mountain, or headland, is 
bathed in purple Ught, and every sun rises and sets ^^ trailing clouds of glory. ^' The genius 
of Claude can be estimated only in Italy, ibr nowhere else are found the skies that he 
painted. 

The language in which the infant Italian first lisps, is like the murmur of music ; every 
sound is open and labial. The first country, over which his eye ranges, is unsurpassed on the 
earth ; it has festoons of vines, purple with gushing grapes ; and groves of oranges, bending 
with golden fruit. The churches, where the youth pays his wondering devotions, are the 
perfection of human art, the most splendid and ^'solemn temples" ever reared by human 
bands. The ruins, in which he plays with his mates, are remains, in which no time ctti 
obliterate the beauty ; and the paintings, the frescoes, and the sculptures, that often chain his 
attention, all combine to give the direction of his genius to the graceful, the beautiful, and the 
ideal. 

'* We gmze Â«iid turn away, we know not wbert) 
Dazzled, and drunk with beauty : till Uie heart 
Reels with its fulness ; there, forever Uiere, 
Chained to the chaiiot of triunphant Art." 

The Statues, those calm and majestic intelligences, the impressive congregation of the silent, 
. exert a magic influence over the soul. Feeling and thoughts, they have not ; but they unlock, 
in the beholder, the fountains of both. 

â€¢ 

^ The place became religious, and the heart mn o'er 
With silent worship of the great of old ; 
The dead, but sceptred sovereigns, who still rule 
Oor spirits from their urns." 

Few of the Italians lead a domestic life ; their fine climate permits them to pass almost all 
the time without shelter, and their social organization gives them little taste, or capacity, for 
domestic enjoyment. A state of society, execrable in itself, and pernicious in all its conse- 
qoences, is too general in Italy. Marriage is not a bond, but the reverse ; â€” it is perfect free- 
dom from all restraint. Unmarried females are generally excluded from society, in convents, 
or in the garrets of palaces. The married have everywhere more freedom, than an evil cus- 
tom has rendered consistent with modesty. The custom of cicUbetamj is on the decline ; yet) 
in all places, the married dame is allowed to retain the cavalier servente ; and in some, it is not 
easy for a married lady, who has none, to avoid ridicule. Napoleon, indeed, directed, that no 
married parties should be received at court, if they came not together ; but this innovation 
lasted but for a short time. In a state of society .like this, the females will, of course, excel 
is the syren accomplishments ; and the Italian ladies have few rivals in danci^^, singing, and 
poetry- 
It is a consequence of a depraved state of society that morals are, in Italy, without the cog- 
nizance of public opinion. Offences against taste may be visited with censure, but no outrage 
against good morals ^ no ofl^ence against honor or honesty will exclude a man from society, or 
abate his welcome ; nor will a dereliction of modesty bring any discredit on a woman. To 
oe vinaoas in such a state of society, is far more difficult, than in better communities ; and 
common virtue here, deserves the honors of heroism. Yet, though the substance is lost, the 
shadow is preserved ; and the Court of Rome, especially, is solicitous to preserve appear- 
ances. Here is, at least, an appearance of decorum. A person, indeed, may pass through 
Italy, or live there for years, and not once be shocked with such undisguised vice, as in one 
nigte will intrude upon him in an English city. In England, good and evil are kept distinct ; 
tbey exist in their greatest height and depth in the same society, but they are never so blended, 
that one could Â« for a moment, be mistaken for the other. 

In Piedmont, the character, manners, language, and dress, are generally French. The in- 

28 



218 ITALY. 

habitants, like all mountaineers, are much attached to their country, and though many of them 
wander over Europe with a handÂ«organ, a marmot, or a dancing bear, they return, when, after 
many years, their frugality has obtained a small sum which is independence in their own indi- 
gent country, in Lombardy, which has for many years m the present century bad mofe 
freedom than the other States of Italy, the traces of it are found in liberal principles, a better 
system of education, and a better organization of social life. Since the expulsion of the 
French, the old distinction of classes has been somewhat revived ; the highest class is the no- 
bility, but an equally respectable and intelligent one, the Cittadiniy was admitted by Napoleon, 
at court. This class is composed of the liberal professions, the small-landed proprietors, &c., 
and it embraces a great portion of the worth of Milan. 

The Tuscans are a gentle and kind people, and seldom yield to violent impulses, like their 
southern neighbors. They areÂ« to a great degree, charitable ; and some of their benevolent 
institutions have been in uninterrupted operation for 500 years. The Misericordia is a so- 
ciety highly characteristic of the Tuscans, and is extended over all Tuscany. The memberS) 
who are of all ranks, even the highest nobility, hold themselves ready, at the sound of their 
bells, to assemble for purposes of charity. These are generally to remove the sick or wound- 
ed to their hospitals, and to bury the dead. Each member has a loose robe, which covers him 
entirely, and in which 2 holes are left for the eyes. These societies have large funds, which 
they bestow in charity. The exertions of the associations have not been relaxed in several 
plagues. The amiableness of the Tuscans is shown in the scarcity of crime, and dread of 
capital punishments. There is \)ot, for years, an execution ; and at the last, in Florence, the 
city was deserted by half its inhabitants. Those, who could not go, crowded the churches, 
and their appearance indicated a general calamity. The character of the people, the fine cli- 
mate, and lively cities, make Tuscany the residence of many foreigners, who generally esteem 
Florence the most delightful city of Italy. The society at Florence is intelligent and refined. 
The nobility have lost much of their ancient wealth, acquired in commerce, and they hold it 
to be derogatory to engage in commercial pursuits. Pride, however, is seldom consistent, and 
they feel no shame, even princes, in selling wine and oil at retail, under the direction of their 
stewards, in the cellars of their palaces. The signs, in this petty traffic, are broken oil-fltsks, 
hung at the window. 

At Rome, it has been said, that the greatest ruin is that of the national character. Certain 
It is, that at Rome there are few Romans like Cato or Regulus. The few, who arrogate to 
themselves the characteristics of the ancient Romans, are the Trasteverinij who live across the 
Tiber. They are jealous, quarrelsome, and ferocious ; and more ready to shed blood on 
slight provocations, than any others of their irritable countrymen. They call themselves Emt- 
nentij as all barbarians designate themselves by a term of superiority. The murders most 
common in Rome, as in all Italy^ are those which arise from sudden impulse, and are chiefly 
confined to the lower classes, all of whom are easily heated by wine, though few are intem- 
perate. Simond states the number of murders in Rome to be about one a day, but this com- 
putation seems quite too large. There is little disposition in the people to arrest a murderer, 
or indeed in any case to interfere to aid the execution of the laws. The churches and con- 
vents are sanctuaries, and even the streets and squares in front of them. One murder is often 
avenged by another, when it is not atoned fbr by a sum paid to the family of the deceased. 
The murders are almost always committed with knives, the use of firearms being universally 
considered atrocious. 

The Romans, generally, are the least cheerful of all the people of Italy, though at the Car- 
nival their gayety is without bounds. It would seem, from their dispositions, that to live among 
the wrecks of former greatness, has a depressing effect upon their spirits. On the many holy- 
days that abound in the capital of the Catholic Church, the common people are seen listlessly 
standing or sauntering about the streets, with no outward sign of cheerfulness ; wheieas, on 
holydays, or on all days, at Florence and Naples, the inhabitants seem to be animated by some 
joyous impulse. But no extremes are more distant than the character at Rome and Naples. 
But the Romans have much to depress them, besides the ruins of former greatness, which, in- 
deed, make no part of their regrets. They are oppressed, pillaged, bound in ignorance, and 
steeped in poverty. They live in a gloomy city, surrounded by a desert, and the malaria in- 
vades their very dwellings. There is open to them no ennobling pursuit ; to talent there is 
neither excitement nor reward. There are neither the amusements of the French, nor the

donestic lift of cbd English ; and if the RomaD is not cheerful by temperament, he has litile 
10 his circumstances to make him so. 

The relaxations of other nations make the business of the Romans. Poetry is their pursuit, 
and their discourse is full of it. Every family has its versifier, with sonnets and epigrams for 
every occasion ; and every circle has its improvisatore, or extemporaneous poet, who versifies 
to a crowd of listening admirers. The epigram is now the chief outlet for the keen sarcasm 
of the Romans. Speech is restricted, the press is bound, and even Pasquin and Marforio have 
ceased to correspond ; but sharp epigrams, directed even against the authorities of the 
cbnrcb, circulate freely in society. In those squibs, which were so annoying to Napoleon, the 
Romans excel. 

There are in Rome about 20,000 Jews, who are less strictly dealt with than in common 
Catholic countries. They are, indeed, shut up at night in their own quarter, which is some- 
what crowded ; but so little do they regard this, that when the restramt was once removed, 
the elders requested to have it again imposed. The Jews are so devoted to traffic, that a 
stranger is persecuted with invitations to enter their shops. They preserve, even here, in that 
city which was the instrument of subverting their own, a remnant of national pride, and 
none of their race have, for eighteen centuries, passed under the arch of Titus, which com- 
memorates the destruction of Jerusalem. They pass the arch by a path at the side. Two 
Jews make a part of some pageant of the church, in which they are exhibited as converts to 
Christianity. Yet so hard is it to get new converts annually, that the Pope is sometimes com- 
pelled to exAbit the same on several occasions. 

Society is not very accessible at Rome, and the Romans are not hospitable. They seldom 
mvite strangers to entertainments ; their houses have little furniture, and their palaces are built 
less for use than for show. Many of them are let for lodgings, and the proprietor occupies 
sooae obscure comer. No court or vestibule is lighted, and all visiters at night carry a lantern. 
In Rome, wherever the stranger visits, the servants of the house, who usher him in or out, or 
fake his hat and cloak, come, on the next day, for the standing vails established by custom, 
^or about three pauls each. In Bologna, all visits are made at the boxes of the theatres, 
and this is the only city in Italy where young unmarried females are admitted to society as 
io England. 

None of the higher class in the Roman State, and few in all Italy, live in the country. AH 
dwell in cities, and the peasants are deprived of the advantage which is always derived from 
the residence of the landed proprietors. All the operations of agriculture are imperfect, and 
all the implements rude. The very wine and oil are often spoiled from want of skill. Agricul- 
ture is not the road to wealth ; it is hardly a means of support ; and the peasants are generally 
beggars. Rome, Naples, and the towns of the south, are infested with mendicants, whose dis- 
tress is not always assumed, for in this country of fertility many are without food. The stairs 
of palaces, the porticoes, and the churches are the lodgings of the miserable many who live on the 
scanty avails of public charity. The poverty extends to all ranks ; and the traveler is solicited 
to relieve the noble as well as the peasant. Veiled females kneel in the streets, holding out 
their bands in supplication ; others cover their blushes with masks ; while the monks solicit for 
the souls of the dead, the alms of which are forthwith applied to the comforts of the living. 

The inhabitants of the Neapolitan territory preserve the levity and cheerfulness of their 
Greek ancestors ; and they have a vehemence of character that seems suited to their volcanic 
soil. All their pursuits, whether of pleasure, devotion, or gain, inspire them for the moment 
with the ardor of a ruling passion. The Arnauts of Calabria are a fine race of men, hardy, 
and brave, but less cheerful than their countrymen of the plains. Naples is one of the gayest 
cities in Europe, as Rome is one of the most gloomy.' The climate is delicious ; and the 
Neapohtans, with as few domestic tendencies as the Romans, and with a better climate tbap 
that of Rome, live principally in the streets and squares, and on the quays. There, in the 
open air, are the benches of mechanics, the fires of cooks, and the stages of mountebanks. 
The streets swarm with crowds of all ranks, all active, yet all idle ; doing nothing, and yet sel- 
dom at rest. Everything that is said or done has a spice of violence ; two people talking to- 
gether gesticulate like madmen ; the litde calashes are driven up hill and down, at full speed, 
aod a salesman announces his wares as fire is cried in more quiet cities. It is easy for a 
stranger to see, that he is among a people much disposed to enjoy to-day at the expense of 
to-morrow. In no other city are seen so many groups of the poorest rabble in boisterous merri- 



ITALT, 

ineat. A few grains to parchase wme and macaroiu, will raiae one of the lazzaroni thon ill 
the ills of mortality for a day. 

The lazzaroni, a race of idle Vagrants, are a large class at Naples ; and the city woidd lose 
half its characteristics to be without them. One of these is the model of Diograes, and though 
he may never require the shelter of the tub, it is his pleasure, as it was that of the cynic, to 
lie in the sun. The wants of nature in this climate are few ; less food is needed dian in colder 
countries, less clothing is worn than in any other civilized capital, and less shelter is necessary 
than that which is sought by some of the birds of the air. The lazzmroni are ignorant, bm 
shrewd. The circle of their thoughts is limited ; but if they are attacked within this compiss 
their adroitness, wit, and drollery are invincible. Madame de Stael remarks, that some of 
them are so ignorant, that they do not know their own names, but go to the confessor to acÂ« 
knowledge anonymous sins, being incapable of telling him the name of the transgressor. But 
they are not stupid ; they are sagacious demi-savages, living on the confines between civiliza- 
tion and barbarism, in one of the largest capitals of Europe. No stranger, unless a king, is titled 
under his merits, and a plain man is even sometimes addressed as Maje$ty. The hwxtm 
address every one from whom they expect to extract a grain, as ^^ Excellency," and the title 
is liberally applied on all occasions, even in a simple negative or affirmative, as *^ n ExcellenzMj 
no Excelknza,^^ 

They are without hypocrisy, for they make no pretensions to virtue or honesty. If detected 
in picking a pocket, they will but laugh, and if accused, will say, that a poor man is not ex- 
pected to be a saint. A stranger perceives, in all people with whom he deals,^n inteotioD, 
and often a combination, to cheat him, and soon learns to offer but a small part of what prices 
are demanded, and to settle the price before purchasing. His valet de place takes him to 
tradesmen, with whom he shares the profit ; and when, unattended, the stranger enters a shop, 
a Neapolitan sometimes follows him, making a sign to the dealer, that he has brought one to 
be plucked, nid subsequently demanding a small sum for the pretended service. 

The animal spirits of the Neapolitans are the best gifts they receive from nature, and tbey 
are sufficient to disarm every want of its power of annoyance. It is surely no slight accession, 
to agreeable sensations, to live under a sky forever brilliant and soft, and surrounded by objects 
of surpassing magnificence and beauty. The tendency of these is to promote cheerfulness. 
It is an era in the life of a foreigner when he first beholds that unrivaled bay, with its natural 
pharos, Vesuvius ; that noble city, to which the ancients prefixed a word expressing pleasant- 
ness ; and that enchanting region of vines, aptly called the campt^a felice^ or happy country. 
These things, that are so striking to a stranger, cannot be lost upon the native, though they 
may dispose him to a life of indolent enjoyment. This seducing climate has ever enervated 
the courage of men, and subverted the modesty of women. It was the region to which the rich 
and luxuriant Romans tended, and the shores of Baia were lined, as with a colonnade, by the 
continued porticos of villas and temples. Men who held provinces elsewhere, were solicitous 
of possessing a villa here. 

17. Amusements. The opera is the great national amusement of the Italians, and a taste for 
it has spread over Europe. The decorations and dresses are splendid, and in perfect charac- 
ter or keeping, while the music is of the highest grade. An opera is a play set to music, and 
sung ; and the ballet which follows it, is a play performed in pantomime, by a corps of dancers. 
Othello itself has been performed as a ballet. Though unnatural combinations, the opera and 
the ballet are capable of afl!brding much entertainment. The most splendid operas are La 
Scala, at Milan, and San Carlo, at Naples. There are minor operas in every considerable 
town. 

Italy can hardly be said to have a drama, though theatres are numerous ; the plays of Al- 
fieri and a few other good writers, are not adapted to the stage, or to the political state of It- 
aly. The drama, however, has been cast into a regular form, chiefly by Goldoni, and the oW 
national commedie dell ' arte are becoming disused . These are the mere plots or incidents in 
which the dialogue is left to the invention and humor of the actors, which, in this improvising 
country is seldom found wanting. The characters are seldom varied, though the plots m^ 
changed. The persons represented give opportunities to ridicule the different dialects and 
local characters ; they are the Pantaloon of Venice, the Polichinello of Naples, the Rogue of 
Ferrara, the Doctor of Bologna, &c. 

Actors are low in the estimation of the Italians. A prima d^nna goes round to solicit at- 
tendance at her benefit, and sits at the door to receive the money for tickets. The prompter 



ITALY. t21 

appears on the stage, and often talks with the females k the pit. The muiicittiS) in the vomoat 
tbeatreS) extinguish their candles between the acts, and put them in their pockets. At Rome, 
the theatres are built only of wood, from a fiction of state, that they are temporary. The 
police even pretends to know nothing of the existence of them, yet the authorities take offence 
when parties are given on play nights^ which detract from the profits of the theatre, and the 
consequent revenue to the state. No word or sign of disapprobation is allowed at an Italian the* 
atre ; and to hiss at one in Rome would subjept the offender to be taken to the cavaletto, a 
kind of stocks, whipped, and carried back again to his seat. The theatres have names and 
devices like ships, and also mottoes. The jantoeetni, or puppets, are a general amusement, 
and the best are at Rome. They are managed with much skill and effect. The Italians are 
somewhat addicted to gaming, and this disposition is increased by standing public lotteries ; 
though averse to risks in all things else, in gaming they lose all prudence, and venture upon 
the most ruinous stakes. 

The amusements of the Carnival, though somewhat on the wane, are still sufficiently attrac- 
tive to draw 7 or 8,000 English to Rome, where the Piasza di Spagna has the appearance of 
aa English town. The sports of the Carnival are ushered in by a public execution, for which 
a aaalefactor, or more than one, is reserved. The Corso, the principal street of Rome, is the 
scene of the Carnival. The windows and balconies are filled with people, and there is in the 
street a dense and ever-moving crowd, all in masquerade. The carriages are, many of them, 
devised for the occasion, and some of them represent ships, temples, and classic pageants. 
The coachmeb are commonly disguised as old women. All dresses, and characters may be 
assumed, except those of the clergy. The masks are worn for defence as well as for conceal- 
meot or show, for there is an incessant tempest of sugar-plums, or rather of a base counterfeit, 
made of lime. The people have bags or baskets full of these, and all pelt each other. Child- 
ish as this is, it is followed with so much zeal, that it becomes very amusing. 

At the close of day, several spirited horses, without riders, are started from the head of the 
Corao, and goaded by little points, that are made to flap against the flanks. The crowds open 
to give space, and the horses are stopped at the foot ot the street, after running about a mile. 
Then each one of the immense concourse lights a candle, with which he has furnished himself, 
and a scene of uproar commences, each one trying to extinguish bis neighbor's light, and to 
{Reserve his own. These amusements of the Carnival last 3 days, and they are similar in all 
the cities. It is extremely creditable to the Italians, that in these saturnalia, where all people 
roiogle, there is never a breach of order, or of decorum. The same could not be said of such 
a masked multitude in any other country. ^^ In Venice, Tasso's echoes are no more ;" but 
they still resound in Naples. It is very common, on the quay, or in a square, to see a motley 
crowd collected round a man, who reads a portion of the Jerusalem Delivered, which he sea- 
sons with a great degree of action, Tasso, of course, is a favorite, and the common people 
call him Rinaldo. Stories are read or recited in the same way, at the most interesting passage 
of which, the reader or relater pauses, to collect his dues, by passing round his hat. 

18. Slate of the Jlrta^ Science and Literature. A history of Italy, would include a full 
accoimt of modern act, of which the monuments are chiefly in Italy, or so many of them, that 
this country is the only school for artists. Sculpture has, at the present day, attained to great- 
er excellence than painting. Thorwaldsen, a Dane, the son of an Icelander, was lately the 
greatest sculptor. He had an original, but somewhat erratic genius; his statues have much merit, 
and his reliefs have not been surpassed, but in antiquity. Had he lived 50 years before, he 
would have secured a greater fame ; for it is perilous, even for excellence in the art, to be con- 
temporary with the works of Canova, who has drawn from marble the most perfect forms, 
that have been created since the best ag;e of Grecian sculpture. Of an obscure parentage, 
poor, and seemingly destined to be a village stone-cutter, at the age of 15, the aspirations of 
genius carried Thorwaldsen to Venice, and in 15 years more, he erected, in St. !reter's, the 
mofHunent to Ganganelli. Some of the works of Canova are so beautiful, that it has been de- 
nied, that he had sufficient versatility of powers to express majesty or grandeur. But his 
Perseus, Pi^ilists, Hector, and Washington, are incontrovertible proofs to the contrary. The 
PugQists are the only modern statues in the Vatican. One figure stands defenceless, with his 
baiid raised over his head, while the other is about to deal a single blow, in which, by a previ- 
ous agreement, he was not to be resisted, and which, according to the Greek story, that Ca- 
nova has represented, occasioned immediate death. The statue of Washington was lately 
bvnit in the Capital of North Carolina. It was a favorite work with the artist. The Venus, 



828 ITALY. 

at the Pitti palace, is, perhaps, the most admired, of all the works of Canova. It represents, 
like the Venus de Medicis, a shrinking female ; she has been surprised, without her dress, and 
has caught it up, and presses it before her. The statue of the princess Pauline Borgbese, b 
said to be exceedingly beautiful, but it is not permitted to be seen. 

Sculpture, as well as painting, revived with the dawn of liberty, in Italy ; and it attained to 
ns perfection in the republics of the middle ages. The founder of modem sculpture, was Ni- 
colo Pisano, before the close of the 13th ceiUury ; and, in a succeeding age, his grandsoo 
carried the art to Florence, which became its home. In the 15th century, 6 great masters 
became competitors for tha same work, at Florence, the carving of the bronze gates of the 
Baptistery, which was assigned to Ghiberti, a youth of 22 years, and which, in 40 years, he 
completed so well, that Rf. Angelo pronounced the gates to be "worthy of Paradise:" an 
admiration that posterity has justified. At this period, Donatello was conspicuous for his own 
works, and the merits of his pupils. In the 16th century, and for about three-quarters of it. 
Michael Angelo Buonarotti presided over painting, sculpture, and architecture, and left imper- 
ishable monuments in all. The Last Judgment, is the boast of modern painting. It has more 
than 300 figures, and the subject is well suited to the terrific genius of the artist. The smtue 
of Moses bears the impress of the same original mind ; and the vast dome of St. Peter's, the 
most wonderful work of human hands, is the only production of art, that awes the beholder 
like the works of nature. 

The sculptures of M. Angelo are few, and the most of thenrt are unfinished. He geperalty 
cut boldly into the marble, without the usual models in clay, and with rapid strokes brought 
forth the form, of which there existed no image, but in the vivid conception of bis own mind. 
His genius was wonderful, but it was not of the kind that attracts human sympathy and feeling. 
It does not act upon the afl!ections, like the milder power of Raphael. His .genius has been 
called the epic, and that of Raphael, the dramatic, of the art. The best of the imitators of 
M. Angelo, were Bandinella, and John of Bologna, who was the most eminent of his pupils. 

Sculpture afterwards passed into the affected hands of Bernini and others, who robbed it of 
simplicity ; and it was losing its graces, and almost its existence, when Canova raised it to its 
ancient glory. The modern sculptures of Italy, are too numerous even to be named in our 
limits. They are in churches, palaces, museums, and squares. They are in conspicuous 
places, and open to the inspection of all. There are, at this time, many sculptors in Italy, 
mferior, indeed, to Thorwaldsen, whose works adorn the houses of the wealthy in Europe and 
America. 

Painting was revived at Florence, under the pencil of Cimabue, early in the 13th centur>'. 
Â£riotto, Massaccio, and others, advanced it ; but Leonardo da Vinci raised it to a perfection, 
that has hardly been exceeded. His sweet Mona Lisa, has been surpassed only by Raphael. 
His Medusa's head, the work of his wondrous boyhood, is one of the chief treasures of the 
Florentine Gallery. It is painted on a shield, and the terrific snakes, which form the hair, owe 
their appalling effect to his diligent study of the reptiles, collected from the fens, and kept in 
his closet. The Last Supper, of Leonardo, is more generally known ; it is multiplied hi 

Erints, and especially in the matchless engraving of Morghen. The original is much defaced ; 
ut fortunately, there exist excellent copies. It is in the refectory of the Dominican Convent, 
at Milan ; it has suffered from damps, neglect, repairs, and wilful violence. Soldiers have 
used it, as a target ; and the monks, to lessen the distance between the kitchen and the refec- 
tory, or the spit and the table, have caused a door to be cut through the princial figure, that of 
the Saviour. About 20 years later than Leonardo, Michael Angelo Buonarotti was born, 
whose great works, in this art, are the Last Judgment, and the frescoes on the walls and ceiling 
of the Sistine Chapel. 

Contemporary with the great Florentine, was Raphael, who died on his 87th birthday, be- 
queathing to the world many works, the perfection of all that is excellent and tender in senti- 
ment, or glowing in art. In 12 years, he completed the frescoes of the Vatican, and the Fa^ 
nesina, and others, amounting to many hundred figures ; designed the Cartoons, and produced 
numerous oil paintings, which are now scattered over Europe. The most wonderful of all, is, 
perhaps, the Transfiguration, which was his last work, finished just before his death. ThÂ® 
school of Athens, one of his frescoes in the Vatican, is encyclopedic ; it contains 52 figures, 
admirably grouped, in front of a Grecian portico. Aristotle and Plato are engaged in argth 
ment ; Diogenes, an inimitable figure, is lying on the steps, and Socrates is chiding and ex- 
horting Alcibiades. This, like all the frescoes at Rome, is injured by tbe damps, and tbe

smoke of torches, while its preservation is utterly neglected. No other human being has been 
able, like Raphael, to give such glimpses of sinless purity, that seem to have been breathed 
upon him from a better world. 

Our limits will not allow any other, than the most general view ; and the bare outlines of 
Italian paintings would require volumes. Italy is peopled with ^^ hemes of the mind"; ofi^ 
springs of the genius of Correggio, Tintoret, Claude, Caravaggio, the Uaracci, Domenichino, 
Carlo Doici, Guercino, Guido, SaJvator Rosa, and many other masters. The number of good 
paintings seems immense ; collection after collection, aud museum after museum, open upon 
the traveler ; and the walls of hundreds of edifices are covered with frescoes, to examine 
which, is the work of months. The frescoes contain the best productions of. the art. The 
best living painters are Cammucina, at Rome, and Benvenuto, at Florence. The former is 
the best draughtsman in Europe, but neither of them have the great requisites for excellence. 
The art of Engraving, with the exception of Morghen's works, is not in so high a state in 
Italy, as it is in Great Britain. Morghen, however, is without a rival. At Rome, the art of 
cutting cameos from oriental shells has attained to a high perfection. There is here too a 
public establishment for mosaic, by which any picture may be copied with the utmost delicacy 
and fidelity, in materials not subject to fading or decay. The materials are small pieces of 
glass of every shade of color, and they are laid in a durable cement. The scarpellini or workers 
in stone, are peculiar to Rome, where foreigners supply them with many orders for miniature 
roodek of various antiquities. It is characteristic of Italy, that taste is cuhivated before com- 
fort is secured, and that, though the arts of ornament are high, those of use are almost unknown. 
Music is as natural to Italy as sunny skies. Her vocal performers and composers are cele- 
brated throughout the world, and the chief graces and beauties of modern music have been 
derived from them. Vocal music, as not necessarily requiring either study or exertion, apÂ« 
pears peculiarly adapted to the indolent character of the Italians. A fine voice is a gift from 
heaven, which man enjoys in common with the birds, and which seems to arise like a sponta- 
neous voice of gratitude from amidst the vineyards and orange-blossoms of their cloudless land. 
Yet we do not find that music was cultivated as a science by the Italians so soon as by 
many other nations. It was not till the beginning of the 17th century, that the opera or musi- 
cal drama was introduced in Rome and Venice ; nor till the beginningofthe eighteenth century 
at Naples. Till the time of the elder Scarlatti, Naples was less diligent in the cultivation of 
dramatic music than any other Italian state. Since that time, all the rest of Europe has been 
furnished with composers and performers from that city, and the opera of San Carlo at Naples 
is unrivaled even by the Scala at Milan. The Italian opera has been imported into all the 
great towns in Europe, and the singers are engaged at an enormous sum. Nicolino Grimaldi 
the Neapolitan, was the first great Italian singer who appeared on the London stage ; soon 
after the two celebrated rivals, Faustina Bordoni, and Francesca Arzzoni, excited as violent 
and inveterate a party spirit in London as any that had ever occurred relative to matters either 
theological or political. The caprice of a prima donna is proverbial ; and the famous Fari- 
nelli, celebrated for the force, extent, and mellifluous tones of her voice, was heard to ex- 
claim in rapture, " There is but one God, and one Farinelli ! " Gabrielli, the daughter of a 
cardinaPs cook in Rome, was long famous for her exquisite voice, and unbounded caprice. 

The flood of harmony with which the voice of Catalani used to enchant her auditors will 
long be remembered ; though the powers of that splendid singer are beginning to decline. 
Giudita Pasta is now nnrivaled by any modern cantatrice* Her powers of execution are 
perhaps less wonderful than those of Catalani, but her taste is infinitely superior, and the judg- 
noent of Talma pronounred her to be the greatest singer and actress, together, who had yet 
appeared in Europe. The Italians are sensible of her merit, and a medal was struck in her 
honor some years since, by order of the late Pope ; but the Italians are apt to be ungrateful 
towards those who have exerted themselves for their amusement, and when Grassini a few 
years ago, forgetful of the efl!ect of time upon her once splendid voice, reappeared on the 
boards of La Pergola at Florence, the ungrateful audience who had so often listened entranced 
to her melodious notes, unanimously hissed her off the stage. Rossini, the great modem 
coosposer, has long reigned unr'valed in Italy, and since the death of Weber, in Europe. 
There are not, indeed, wanting those who accuse the grand maestro of having corrupted the 
modem taste, of having lowered the standard of music from the tender dignity of Mozart's 
style, and bestowed upon it a redundancy of ornament fatal to science. 
Rossini frequently copies himself. His style may be seen through all his numerous works, 



aSt ITALT. 

btk dthough he is perhi^ too uniformly flowery, gay, and tender, be has 9?en proofii U 
higher powers in hb Tancredi, Semiramide, and Moise in Egitto. It is probable, however^ 
that the music of Rossini which now enchants the world, will be foi^tten long before that 
of Haydn or Mozart, or at least that posterity will bestow a more sober judgment upon his 
works, than the present age, bewildered by his succession of glittering melodies, is capable of 
pronouncing. 

The national airs of Italy are suited to her soft and mellifluous language, which Metastasio 
has pronounced to be ^' la musica sUssa.^^ Singing is common among the Italian peasaotiy. 
The Venetian barcaroles, and the songs of the Venetian gondoliers of alternate stanzas from 
Tasso's Jerusalem, give proof of that love of music and poetry which is there inherent id the 
lowest classes. Even among the tuneful sons of Italy, the Venetians are remarkable for their 
taste in both. The songs of the gondoliers, which are rude and hoarse when near, are inex* 
pressibly charming when heard from a dis:ance. The sound is not dismal, but plaintive in 
the extreme. 

The ancient literature of Italy has overspread the world, and the Latin has become a uni- 
versal language. Italy was the first country in which knowledge was cultivated after the dark 
ages. The magnificent remains of the Romans, tended to excite in the Italians a desire to 
investigate their learning. For two o^nturies Italy was again the luminary of Europe. Poets 
and other writers of excellence preceded Dante, who was born in 1265. He wrote in a new 
and unformed language, and his use of it is still a classic standard. Posterity has estimated 
him better than his own age, and perhaps ranks him higher than he rated himself, though ia 
his great poem he assigns his own place after Homer, Virgil, Ovid, Lucan, and Statius. Pe- 
trarch was the ornament of the 14th century, and it is one of the least of his honors, that he 
was crowned in the capitol. Boccaccio, his friend, with inexhaustible invention and wit, did 
much in his Decamerone to polish his native language. Ariosto marks the 16th century, and 
he was followed by Tasso ; their works are known in every language that has a literature. 
Galileo, Machiavelli, Davila, and Guicciardini, are great names in science, politics, and his- 
tory ; and there are many others in almost every department of Uterature and science. With 
the Italian governments of the present day, it is a part of the policy of self-preservation, to 
depress the soarings of intellect ; yet Alfieri stands forth the monument of his age in Italy ; 
and the works of Casti, Monti, Pindemonte, Muratori, Botta, and others are honorable to 
Italian literature. 

19. Religion. The Roman Catholic religion is established throughout Italy, and nowhere 
else has it so many splendid accessories, addressed to the senses and the imagination. There 
are Protestant communities in Piedmont, which, however, are much restricted, though gen- 
erally the Italians are not intolerant, and Protestants, Greeks, and Mussulmans may approach 
the Pope himself. The English at Rome, have on the great festivals of the church a con- 
spicuous place assigned them. This gave occasion for one of the Italian pasquinades. Ma^ 
forio is supposed to warn his correspondent Pasquin, that he would find no place at the solem- 
nities to be held in St. Peter's ; the reply was, '' pardon me, I have turned heretic." 

The clerg;y are numerous ; many of the churches are rich, and all of them are highly orna- 
mented. The Italians are fond of religious processions, in which they have much faith. On 
occasions of public calamities, as fires, pestilence, and, at Naples, eruptions of Vesuvius, long 
processions go through the streets carrying images of saints and consecrated relics. There 
are many shrines, which many pilgrims visit. To St. Peter's a few poor peasants annually 
come, with staff and scallop shell, induced by a small gratuity given by the Pope. But the 
most numerous pilgrims at St. Peter's are those of taste, and not of devotion. The Bfe^ 
House at Loretto has a greater reputation with the devout. It is believed to be the actnjl 
house of the Virgin Mary, brought by an angel to the spot on which it stands. A scribe a 
employed to register the gifts made to the altar, which include not only the mites of the poor, 
but the donations of kings. At Rome the Scala Santa, or marble stairs of Pilate's house, 
which, as the people believe, Christ ascended, are now ascended by his followers on their 
knees. All classes may b6 seen toiling up them in this way, though there is another pass^ 
by which they come down. Relics of all kinds abound in countries where there is more faith 
than knowledge ; and they are as numerous in Italy as in Spain. Some of them, indeed, 
have returned to " strange uses." The chair of St. Peter, which is kept in his church, too 
sacred for inspection, was yet examined by the sacrilegious French ; and there was found 
upon it in Arabic, the Mahometan confession of faith ; " there is no God but God, and Ma-

faave alvnjrs beeD conrerted to the uses of tbe saoctuary, and many classic observances are dow 
rraeated as Hies of tbe church. Tbe Metamorphoses of Orid are represeuted on the doors 
of St. Peter's ; md tbe bronze image of (he Saint within, whose toe the devotees have kissed 
sway, received, eigbteeo centuries before, tbe incense of heathen priests, as a statue of Jupi- 
ter. Ad Englisbmao once took off his hat to it, not as St. Peter but as Jupiter ; and re* 
quasted of hiai, that, should be erer recover bis power, be would reward the only individual that 
ever bowed to him in bis adversity. Other images have been converted ; Apollo has hecome 
David, and Minerva, Judith, while antique vases are used as baptismal fonts. 

The Italian sailors, like the Grecian, put themselves under tbe protection of the Virgin 
Mary ; and ships have the images of saints at the bows. In storms, they trust as much to 
pnyer as to exertion or skill, and in calms, if impatient for a wind, do not fail to abuse St. Ad- 
tbonr and others in tbe calendar. This, however, is more frequent among the Spanish sailors. 
Marriages in Italy are seldom arranged by those the most inierested. Young females are se- 
cluded io conveats, or at home, til! a match is agreed upon by the parents, when the marriage 
is cslebfaied with considerable show. The funerals at Rome are attended with long procea- 
sioos, and the dead are buried in churcbes. At Naples, the deceased is carried to the grave 
in an open carriage, splendidly dressed, and with the faded color restored by paints. At the 
grave, the finery is stripped off, and the corpse tumbled in the general tomb without ceremony 
or decency. There are 365 pita in the Cempo Merzo, of which one is opened every day, and 
then shut and sealed till (he year brings round the day for it to be open. AU who die are 
tfarowD promiscuously into these pits. Perhaps no people are so indifferent as to the fate of 
their own bodies or (hose of tbeir frieads, as the Neapobtans. Bvrking could never exist at 
Naples ; and the abundance of subjects has much advanced the science of surgery there. 

SO. Lawi. The institutes of Justinian, together with the code and Pandects, a com[Hlation 
of the old Roman law, still continues to fonn the foundation of tbe Italian laws. Tuscany, uadet 
the late Duke, was celehnited for iu mild code, and for the abolition of the punishment of death, 
(he great remedy of crime and the exact administration of justice. But this was before the late 
pc^tical disturbances. But in few of (he States of Italy are the laws so well administered, that 
the subject can appeal to them with much con6dence of obtaining justice. 

31. jSHtimitin. <' Tbe nivs of Italy," it bas been said, *'are tbe field of battle, wberÂ« 
Time bas fought against Genius, and those mutilated limbs attest its victory and our losses." 
Of the Roman antiquities, we can meniion but fen: ; the most interesting are at Rome, where 
there are still many yet undiscovered ; for (he government employs only a few galley slaves in 
excavating ; and although foreigners are allowed to search, they are not permitted to carry an^ 
sculpture away. Many of the best ancient sculptures were found under the ruins of the edi- 
fices where they stood, br imbedded in the accumulation of earth, that now lies above the level of 
the ancient ciw, Tbe Roman Forum is 15 or SO feet above the ancient surface, and else- 
where tbe ditterence may be from 12 to 30 feet ; the hills have been sunk, and tbe valleys 
raised. Li many places where (his accumulation bas been examined, valuable antiquities have 
beea found ; and the earth of Rome yet contains mines richer (ban those of gold. That the 
city which received the wealth of the world was profuse in all ornaments of elegance and taste, 

is apparent from the numbers of those that 
remam, and from the quantity found even 
in the distant towns of Pompeii and Her- 
culaneum. 

The bed of the Tiber is supposed to 
contain treasures of art, as waR as of 
wealth, as the inhabitants, when an enemy 
was at hand, would naturalW throw tbeir 
valuables into the river. The Jews of- 
fered to divert the stream from the chan- 
nel, if they migfit be allowed to possess 
what they should Gad. 

Tbe temples are in various states of 
preservation ; some are indistinct ruins, 
others have a few pillars standing, and 
others still retain their original form. Tbe 
moat perfect, and perhaps tbe most beau- 



^ ITALY. 

tiful of all, is the Pantheon of Agrippa. It is a circular edifice, with a dome and coloimtde. 
The light is admitted rrom above only through a circular aperture in the top. The Riding, Ae 
bronze, and the statues are all removed. The Pantheon was anciently ascended by 7 steps, 
but it is now on a level with the, earth. The architecture of the portico is perfect ; every 
moulding is a model of art, and is whitened with the plaster of casts. Over the portico is the 
original inscription of Agrippa, and there is but one other inscription on a temple in Rome. 
The names of many temples are doubtful, though antiquaries decide with promptness, for b 
Rome they are as credulous as the devotees. On each side of the portico are two hideous 
belfreys, erected by the authorities of the Church. The temple of Antoninus and Faustiaa 
has also an inscription. It has a fine portico, and a part of the inner wall of the ancient edi- 
fice. It has been repaired and used as a church. The temple of Vesta has around it a cir- 
cular colonnade of 20 fluted Corinthian columns. About the Roman Forum are the less per- 
fect remains of other temples, as the Temple of Peace, of Jupiter Stator, Jupiter Toiuun, 
Concord, Janus, &c. The ruins of temples are found in all Italy, but perhaps the most iio- 

Eressive are those of Paestum. They are little more than 50 miles from Naples, discoverable 
y a telescope from Salerno ; a distant view is had from the high road of Calabria, yet tbej 
remained undiscovered until the last century. They are not vast in extent, yet the proportions 
are such, that they have an air of grandeur and majesty. In simplicity and grandeur, they are 
some of the most impressive monuments on earth. The pillars and entablatures remain ; the 
inner walk have fallen. 

Of the amphitheatres, the most magnificent is the Coliseum, built by Vespasian and Titus. 
The area is about an acre. The circumference is 1,612 feet. Here were combats of wild 
beasts with each other or with men, the gladiatorial combats, and here the early Christians 
were cast into the arena to be devoured by beasts. The form is an ellipse ; there are 3 rows 
of columns above each other, each of a different order. The entrances were so numerous, 
that each spectator went at once to his seat, and the immense multitude were quickly and safelj 
discharged. It was no ruin in the 13th century, but it was afterwards pillaged for building ma- 
terials, and would not be safe perhaps even now but for a sagacious rite, that consecrated it as 
a church. There is an altar and a hermit in the Coliseum. The rents in the walls give support 
to numerous plants, and there are little less than 300 different kinds. At Verona is another 
vast and splendid amphitheatre, in far better preservation, and a^ Pompeii is one more perfect 
still. At Capua, Puzzuoli, and elsewhere, are the indistinct ruins of others. The onlj 
theatre at Rome is that of Marcellus, of which part of the three lower arcades remain ; so 
perfect in style, that they have often been used as models. The theatres of Pompeii and 
Herculaneum are in perfect preservation. They are of a semicircular form, and nave not 
deep stages; Only one circus remains, the walls of which, though shattered, indicate the 
form. 

The chief triumphal arches are those of Titus, Constadtine, and Septimus Severus. The 
arch of GÂ«onstantine is the most imposing, from its better preservation ; but that of Titus, 
erected to commemorate the conquest of Jerusalem, is of better architecture and sculpture. 
On it are represented the spoils of the temple, as the tables of the law, and the seven golden 
candlesticks. The column of Trajan is one of the most perfect remains of antiquity. It is 
a circular pillar, rising to a great height, and encrusted even to the top, with a spiral succes- 
sion of has reliefs. The subjects are the emperor's actions ; and he appears at a hundred 
different points as emperor, general, or priest. Ancient costume and tactics may be studied 
in these sculptures, it formed but one edifice, in the Forum of Trajan, the most splendid in 
Rome. The rest are prostrated and buried, except a colonnade of broken granite pillars, 
excavated by the French and set upon their bases. The Column of Marcus Aurelius, called 
also that of Antonine, is imposing but of inferior sculpture. It stands on the Corso. 

The Romans were more attached to cleanliness than their successors are. There were in. 
ancient Rome 754 private baths besides those public ones, whose ruins are so impressive. 
The city has now but a sipgle bath which is attached to a hotel ; yet Rome, though in an 
arid situation, is better supplied with water by aqueducts than any other city. Â« 

After the Coliseum the greatest ruin in Rome is that of Caracalla's Baths ; they are of pro- 
digious extent, and one hall is 188 feet by 134. The baths of Diocletian were also vast, and 
something of them remains. The baths of Titus were worthy of Roman magnificence. Some 
â‚¬ff the roofs of the vaults are painted in arabesques, which were favorite studies of Raphael. 
His own arabesques in the Vatican have suffered more in 300 years thfti these in 1,700

Some of the figures are admirable, but 
theie is no perspective, or light and shad- 
ow. At Pompeii the haths are the per- 
fection of elegance and conveDience. 

The obehsks were antiquities to some 
of the ancients ; they were of remote an- 
liquitjr when Rome was in her splendor. 
All were brought from Egypt with incred- 
ible labor and expense. Vet, when in mod- 
ern times one (and not the largest) was to

At Mola di Gaeta is a ruin supposed to mark the spot where Cicero was killed. The tomb 
of tbe Scipio family is a vault, and tbe sarcophagus of Scipio Barbatus is so elegant that it is 
ofleu copied. The sarcophagus of the empress Helena is celebrated ; but nothing is more 
common than these sarcophagi. There are thousands of them, and tbe swine may be some- 
times seen feeding from them. Various funeral inscriptions both in Greek and Latin are set 
in the walls of an entry, at the Vatican. The catacombs are passages excavated for miles id 
cxteni under the city of Rome, and in various directions. Tbey are supposed to have been 
dog out for materials for building, and they sometimes ofiered retreats to tbe persecuted Cbris- 
lIiDs. They were used also as cemeteries, and tbe bones were formerly seen on a sort of 
ibelres hollowed out in the walls. But tbey have all been converted to pious uses, and ex- 
ported as the relics of saints, over the Catholic world. A cardinal bad the care of thia 
locretive traffic. At Naples a great attraction is the tomb of Virgil, or what tradition affirms 
to be such. It is near the grotio of Pausillppo, in a charmiog spot, half way up the hill. It 
ii > small arched dome, with a few niches or columbaria. 

There are some remains of ancient roads, especially of the Appian Way, which is the most 
distinct ai Terracina. It consists of hard hexagonal stones, fitted exactly to each other. At 
Rome is preserved the first mile-stone on this road. At Rimini, there is an ancient bridge, 
1 great monument of architecture ; but at Rome none of the ancient bridges are eniire. The 
Pooj Fabrlcius has much of the old part remaining, and there is a vestige of the Pons Tri- 
nmphalls. There is a single fallen arch of the bridge where Cocles fought. The piers and 
irebes of the bridge of St. Angelo are ancient. At Pausillppo, near Naples, the road passes 
nxler a hill by what is called the grotio of Pausillppo, which was of remote antiquity In the 
Ome of Strabo. It is straight and level, and a little lighted by two orifices from the top of 
â– be hill. It is wide enough for three carriages to pass abreast, 40 or 50 feet in height, and 
^Kni a quarter of a mile m length. Twice in the year the sun shines through It. Notbii^

The aqueducts were, perbspa, the greatest works of the Romans. There were 3 or jreit 
magnitude, the Martian and Claudian ; and a single arch of the latter, makes now the Font 
Maggiore, the most imposing gate of Rome. This aqueduct brought the water, in all its wind- 
ings, about 50 miles ; and ranges of arches still stretch across the camp^na, that excite the 
woi)der of the beholder. The outlet of the Lake of Albano, is a monument of what the Ro- 
mans efTected in the comparative iufancf of the State. It is excavated through a mouDtain, 
principally of rock, for a mile and a half, and it is still an outlet for the lake. It was made 400 
years before the birth of Christ. The Cloaca Maxima, or common sewer of the city, in 
which, though much obstructed by BGcumuletion of earth, the water still flows, was the vaA 
of the kings, and was completed by Tarqninius Superbus. It has stood about 3,000 yetn, 
and may yet outlast every ediGce in Rome. The passage, when clear, was wide enough for i 
load of bay ; but this should not have too liberal a consUuctiou. It is built of lai^e masses of 
stone, aod arched, atleast at the outlet. 

Pompeii and Hercuianeum bare 
been the great '* quarry of antiqui- 
ties" ; here we are admitted into 
the dwellings of the Romans, 
where everything is so fresh, lliat 
we almost expect to see the mas- 
ter enter. He has been dead more 
than 1,700 years, yet we admire 
the pictures od his walls ; and we 
gather, from his household arrange- 
ments end ornaments, somelbisg 
of bis individual character. He 
was a man contemporary with Ti- 
tus, and perhaps a soldier, who 
beheld the destruction of the Jew- 
ish Temple. Pompeii was c0Te^ 
ed with light scorin and ashes, by 
^*^P**- a blast of Vesuvius, from which it 

U disttmt 6 miles, and its place was discovered only in the last century. The circmt of tbe 
walls, and one-third of the city, only, are excavated. The ashes are carried away, thestreel! 
are swept, and nothing but the roofs seem wanting. Tbe streets are narrow, and paved, and 
the ruts of the wheels are about 4 feet apart. There is a narrow sidewalk for foot-passengers, 
though there is none in the modem cities of Italy. The houses are small, and of the form 
now common in Italy, with a court, end rooms opening from it. The rooms were notweQ 
lighted, Bpd some received light only from (he door. The public places are commodious and 
elegant ; and the Romans, without doubt, lived much abroad, like their successors, and like 
the French. The temples are all elegant, and some are tnagnificenl. Tbe forum, and the 
very rostrum, nitb tbe steps, are entire. 

In the furniture, even that of tbe 
kitchen, we are struck with the ele- 
gance, that the Romans carried into 
the most humble department of life. 
There is not a lamp or a vase of an 
inelegant form. The kitchen uten- 
sils were of bronze, though some of 
them were silvered within. Many 
of them were neatly carved. The 
signs remain over the doors, and ibe 
very scrihblings of idlers, on llie 
walls, may still be read. Oil mills 
were found, such as are now used; 
steelyards, like ours ; and Cupid is 
represented, in a painting, under a 
Sb(cÂ«Â«.Â«Â»a rÂ«l(,dtpÂ«Â»p^ parasol. On the walls, many of tbe 

pamtings are excellent, and some represent familiar things. There is a family at dinner, m

they undergo flagellation, may be certain that they sufftr a classic punishment ; for there b a 

Eicture of borsine at school, in which the sufferer is on the. shoulders of another boy, vrldle 
is feet are held by others, and the master flogs. There are stamps for marking ; the nearest 
possible approach to the art of printing. The familiar and common furniture, or ornaments, 
fouod at rompeii, are numerous, far beyond our limits even to name, and they throw much 
Kgbt upon the domestic life of the Romans, and show the wonderful elegance of that polished 
people. * 

uerculaneum, being at the foot of the mountain, was covered with lava, and the town of 
Portici stands direcdy over it. It is impressive to hear the noise of carriages, like distant 
tbuDder, 80 feet above. Herculaneum is, therefore, a mere cavern, which has been partiallj 
excavated. The statues, and other antiquities, are in the museum in Naples. The manu- 
scripts were found carbonized, and nearly as hard as stone ; but a method has been invented, 
by which they are mu'olled, and severalmnimportant treatises have been published. 

Before describing the sculptures, it is proper to mention a few remains, that cannot tirell be 
classed. At Rome, are still to be seen the consular Fasti, the bronze geese of the oapital^ 
aod the very she wolf, that was ancient in the time of Cicero ; it has the mark of the dlectri^ 
fluid, which once struck it, and of the gilding, mentioned by Cicero. The Etruscan remains, 
are the works of a people who were distinguished in the arts, long before the Romans attempt** 
ed them. The most common, is a kind of Porcelain, or vases of baked earth, Ornament* 
ed with great elegance. The ancient walls of Rome are 14 miles in extent, though they 
inclose, at present, much of the desert. In general, they are principally as built 1^ 
Aurelian. 

The sculptures are the most numerous and wonderful remains of the Romans, as weD H 
of the Greeks. Many of great excellence remain, though the best have been lost ; and 
it is certain that those which exist, are but an inconsiderable part of what once ex- 
isted. They were the favorite ornaments of a people, devoted to elegance and art. The 
sculptures, with the medals, coins, seals, &c., are, a great part of them, materials for history. 
The long line of Roman emperors, the good and the worthless, have left their features, as wel 
as character and acts, to posterity. The series is complete. In them, as in the other busts 
pSnd statues, is every variety of countenance, that may be seen in the present age ; though^ 
perhaps the features that we call Roman, predominate. Julius, and Augustus Caesar, Tibe- 
rius, Titus, Marcus Aurelius, are common. There are, however, few sculptures of the re- 
tublic. Cicero yet lives in statuary, and the statue of Pompey remains ; the very marble, 
efore which Cesar fell, and which was found at the place where the great sacrifice was made 
to pauiotism, â€” on the spot 

^ Where BrotiM mide the dhgget'9 edge fforpea 
The cooqiMTor't eword, ia bAring flane away.'* 

It is the statues, that embody the grand moral conception of the ancients. The best are of 
Greek sculpture, of which many were carried to Rome. The greatest collection of scdp- 
tnre, as well as of all the arts, are in 3 vast museums ; the gallery at Florence, the Vatican ait 
Rome, and the Bourbon Museum at Naples. At the gallery, in the room called the Tribune, 
stands the Venus de Medicis, which embodies every human conception of the graceful and 
beautiful. It is the form of a female, of a woman rather than of a goddess, in an attitude of 
the most shrinking modesty and grace. It is an era in the life of a person of taste and feeling, 
to see it ; the impression it makes, is indelible and unrivaled. It marks its excellence, tbSk 
the most exact copies or casts cannot convey an adequate conception of die beautiful original, 
though they are scattered over the worid. It is above imitation. 

The Whetter, in the same room, is a statue much admired, representii^ a man stooping to 
iharpen a knife on the 6oor ; supposed to be the slave, that, while thus employed, overheard 
Cadline's conspiracy. The Wrestlers form one of the best groups of aneient sculpture ; aod 
these, also, are in the Tribune ; they represent 2 men struggling on the ground, in a manner 
that gave the sculptor an opportunity to show the greatest development of the muscles ; and 
tbey make a study for painters, in drawing. The Niobe, in the gallery, is tragedy itself, and 
ibows the aupenority to which the ancients attained in the ideal, above the natural. Hef

At Rome, the Apollo Belvidere is preeminent lor grace and majesty. It has the calmness 
80 common and so impressive in the Grecian statues. He is represented as standing, and 
watching the flight of his arrow, which he has just discharged. It is its greatest wonder, that 
in looking at this cold and lifeless marble, the spectator is more moved than with anything that 
has life. He sees before him ihe creation of a sculptor formed on the conception of immortal- 
ity ; the human form, and all that.it can express, as it might have existed before evil reduced 
it as the habitation pf the fallen mind. Our conceptions of the dignity of human nature are 
elevated m the presence of the Apollo. 

" A combination, and a form indeed, 
Where eTerj god did teem to aet hie eeal* 
To give the worid aaraianoe of a man." 

The Laocoon is a group exactly described in VirgU ; it represents Laocoon and his two 
children in the folds of the two serpents, in which they are still struggling. It was one of die 
most admired groups of antiquity. The dying gladiator is a recumbent statue of a dying man 
leaning upon his hand. It is justly held to be one of the best remains of antiquity. Next to 
actual sight, the description of Bvron gives the most perfect conception of it. The statues are 
well nish innumerable ; but our limits are already exceeded. On the Esquiline hill are two 
colossal statues, each holding a horse of the same proportions ; on one b engraved the name 
of Phidias, on the other, that of Praxiteles. In the capitol, is a bronze equestrian statue of 
Marcus Aurelius, distinguished for good efiect, though it has some individual faults. Sculp- 
ture was, with the Romans as with the Greeks, associated not only with architecture, but it 
was carried into every department of life. Vases, urns, sarcophagi, and familiar ornameots, 
â€¢re numerous, and many of them are exquisitely sculptured. 

CHAPTER XI. KINGDOM OF SARDINIA. 

1. Boundaries^ Extent j and Divisioni* This kingdom takes its name from the island oi 
Sardinia, yet the most important part is upon the continent. This portion forms the nortb*^ 
western extremity of Italv, and consists of 4 principal divisions, namely, 1st. the Principality 
of Piedmont, with Montferrat and a part of the Milanese ; 2d. the County of Nice or Nizza; 
3d. the Duchy of Savoy ; and 4tn. the Duchy of Genoa.* The continental portion is 
bounded by Switzerland on the north ; by Austrian Italy and the Duchy of Parma on the east ; 
by the Mediterranean on the south, and by France on the west. It extends from 43^ 44' to 
4go 2(y N. latitude, and from 5^ 40^ to 10^ E. longitude, being 200 miles in length from north 
to south, and 135 in breadth. The Island of Sardmia, constituting the 5th division, lies to the 
south of Corsica, and is separated from it by a narrow strait. It is 162 miles in length, and 70 
in mean breadth. The continental dominions contain 19, 125 square miles, and the island 9,675. 
Total 28,800. 

2. MowUaine. Sardinia contains several chains of the Alps, comprising the highest sum- 
mits in Europe. The JUaritime Aljm rise near Savona, and, extending west, separate Genoa 
and Nice from Piedmont ; then bending north, they divide the latter country from France, 
terminating near Mount Viso. Their highest summits do not much exceed 10,000 feet. The 
CoUian JSUpe extend from Mount Viso to Mount Cenis, separating Piedmont from France and 
Savoy. Several of their summits rise to the height of 12,000 feet and upwards ; the loftiest, 
Mount OloHj has an elevation of 13,819 feet. The Graian or Grecian Alp$ extend from 
Mt. Cenis to the col or pass of Bonhomme, separating Aosta from Savoy. They have about 
the same elevation as the preceding. The Pennine Mpe separate Piedmont from the Valais 
ID Switzerland, and contain the highest points in the Alps, rising into regions of perpetual 
snow ; Mont Blane^ 15,732 feet high, and Mount Roeay 15,152. In this chain is the Greut 
St. Bemardj 11,000 feet high, remarkable for its hospice, which, standing upon a barren beigbt 
7,668 feet in height, and surrounded by an eternal winter, is inhabited by a few monks, who

here devote tbeir lives to the service of humanity. They provide travelers with food, and, if 
poor, with clothing, and serve them as guides. In the midst of tempests and snow-storms, 
ttiey issue forth, accompanied by their large dogs of a peculiar breed, for the purpose of dis* 
covenDg and relieving those who have lost their way. If they find the body of one who has 
perished, they deposit it in their burial vault, where, on account of the cold, it remains for years 
undecayed. 

3. Rkers. The Rhone forms the northwestern boundary, and receives several tributaries 
from the Graian and Pennine Alps. The principal are the here^ which enters France, and 
the Â«flroe, flowing through the celebrated vale of Chamouni, which lies at the foot of Mont 
Bhmc, and is unrivaled for the beauty and grandeur of its scenery. The Po rises at the foot 
of Mt. Vise, and receives several large streams from the north and the south, among which are 
the Tanaroj from the Maritime, and the Dora, from the Pennine Alps. The Far flows down 
the southern declivity of the Maritime chain, and empties itself into the Mediterranean, after 
separatii^ Nice from France. 

4. Lalus. The Lake of Oeneva bordera this territory on the north, and L(^o Maggiare on 
the northeast. There are manv smaller lakes. That of Bourget^ in Bavoy, is 627 feet above 
the sea ; it is 10 miles in length, and discharges its waters into the Rhone. 

5. Island of Sardinia. More than a third of this island is composed of a sandy and stony 
land, caUed macchie. A considerable part consists of forests and pastures, and the remainder, 
amountbg to 4,400,000 acres is laid out in cornfields, vineyards, olive grounds, orchards, and 
gardens ; 800,000 acres are devoted to the culture of wheat. The mountains are from 1,000 
to 3,000 feet high, and produce silver, copper, lead, bismuth, antimony, and loadstone. Lead 
is most abundant. The moufllon or wild sheep is common here. 

6. Climate. In the valleys of Savoy, there is often fine spring weather when the high 
STouDds are covered with snow. In this part, the climate is too severe for the s<9uthem fruits. 
The valley of Piedmont is subject to the cold northerly winds from the Alps ; yet the air is 
heahhy, and the vine flourishes. In the south, the Apennines aflTord a shelter against the 
Dortb^ blasts ; here the olive and the fruits of the south prosper. Sardinia has a hot climate; 
nd in the marshy spots putrid fevers are common in summer. 

7. Soil The soil of Savoy is stonv, and unfavorable to agriculture. The fertile earth 
lies m a thm strata on the rocks, and is often washed away by the torrents. In Piedmont, 
Mootferrat, and the Milanese, are level and rich alluvial tracts. The soil in the island of 
Sardinia is extremely fertile ; but the canals which formerly drained it are neglected, and 
many parts have become pestilential swamps. 

8. htineraU. Mining is almost entirely nedected ; though the mountains are rich in min- 
erals. Copper is roost abundant. Gold and silver are found in the mountains and valleys ; 
and gold is louod in the sands of Tanaro. 

9. Pau of the Country. This country exhibits very diversified scenery. Savoy is an 
Alpine country, separated by an enormous mountain ridge from the Italian peninsula, and 
intersected by lofty mountains covered with snow and ice. Piedmont and Montferrat form 
the western extremity of the wide valley of the Po. The maritime districts are mountainous, 
and the island of Sardinia is intersected by several mountain ridges of small elevation. 

10. Roadi. One of the most remarkable objects in this country is the road over Mont 
Ceois in Savoy. It was begun by Bonaparte in 1803, and was completed at a cost of 
7,460,000 francs. It is cut through the solid rock, and is furnished with 26 houses of refuge 
io die most elevated and exposed parts, so that the road is safe even in winter ; these houses 
tre provided with bells, which during*fogs arQ rung from time to time to direct the traveler 
ftom one refoge to another. Between France and Savoy is another road called Le$ Ekhelleej 
nearly two miles of it consist of a gallery or tunnel through a solid rock of limestone. This 
road was begun and the greater part of it accomplished by Napoleon. But the Sardinian 
government' had the honor of finishing it. 

11. Cities and Towns. Turin^ the capital of the kingdom, is situated in a pleasant valley, 
OD the western bank of the Po, at the foot of a range of beautiful hills. It is the most regu- 
larly built of all the Italian cities, with broad, straight, and clean streets. It is admired for 
the symmetry of its squares, the splendor of its hotels, and the general elegance of its houses. 
It has 4 splendid gates, adorned with pillars and cased with marble ; 110 churches, a univer- 
nty and many fine palaces. The royal palace is spacious, and surrounded with delightful 
prdens. The outward view of the city is very imposing, and it has no mean suburbs or 
Booidering walls* Population, 135,000.

13- â€¢SgrituUure, The arable land is held by lai^e proprietors who divide their estates 

into small portions among farmers. The farmers seldom become pnmrietors, but in geocrrf 

the land descends from lather to son. The proprietor receives half the 'product for rentaod 

ibe use of the cattle, which are his property ; lor the msadows be is paid in money. Part 

â€¢f the took also commonly beloi^ to the pri^rielor. The fanners are in general very poor. 

Tbe landed proprietors are rich. In the Apennines and a part of the Genoese (erritoiics, 

the peasants are proprietors, but their otij 

wealth consists in cfaesUiutB, sheep, sod 

olives. Wheat, maise, and other gnio, 

rice, beans, and tobacco are cultivated. 

Excellent grapes are raised, but the makiii; 

of tvine is not well understood. Tbe oliva 

is cultivated along the coast, and Genoa ii 

productive in oil. Piedmont raises annually 

30,000 Rwt. of silk. 

13. Commerce. The only important a^ 
tides of exportation are silk, rice, andoS. 
Genoa is the only port which has any for- 
reign commerce. The island of Sardinit 
SItt fTorM. supplies the continental states with salt, sad 

some^rain and vegetables. 

14. JUanufaeturei. There are manufactures of silk at Genoa to tbe amount of 1,000,000 
M 1,400,000 dollars annually. This city also manufactures paper, soap, chocolate, macaroei, 
fcc. In Piedmont are some manufactures of silk. Nice produces perfumes md scented 
Â«Uera. There are some smelling furnsCes in Piedmont and Savoy. 

15. J^fAeriet. The tunny fisheries of the island of Sardinia are said to produce 300,000 
4(rflars a year. The coral fishery is also a considerable source of revenue. 

16. Educatum and Religion. There are four universities, those of Turin, Genoa, Cagliati, 
md Sassuri. Besides these, there are eighty-five colleges and thirty-nine seminaries. 1^ 
common schools are still in a backward stato. With^ the enception of about 33,000 Wil-

CHAPTER XII. AUSTRIAN ITALY, OR THE LOMBARDO-VENE- 

TIAN KINGDOM. 

1. Boundariiiy Extent j and Duniiom, The Austrian dominions in Italy occupy the east* 
m part of northern Italy. They consist of two divisions ; the Republic of Venice, in the 
Qist, and Lombardy, in the west.* They are bounded N. by the Tyrol and Carinthia ; E. by 
I^ia, Camiola, and the Adriatic ; S. by the States of the Church, Modena, and Parma ; and 
W. by the Sardinian dominions. They extend from 45^ to 47^ north latitude ; and from 9^ 
to 14^ east longitude. Their greatest length from east to west, is 220 miles, and their breadth 
140 miles. They contain 17,600 square miles. 

2. Rioere. The Po washes the southern limit of this territory. This river is denominated 
Ae prince of the Italian streams. It rises in the western Alps, on the confines of France and 
Italy, and passes easterly through the Sardinian States, receiving mnumerable streams on either 
hand, firom the Alps and Apennmes. Continuing east, it divides Parma, Modena, and the 
ecclesiastical territory from the Austrian dominions, and falls into the 'Adriatic, after a course 
of 375 miles. It is everywhere deep, with a rapid current. Its branches are the Doria^ Le^ 
na, TUvM^ Jldda^ Oglioy and Jllifiera, from the north ; and the Tanaroy TrebbiCj and Pa^- 
aoro, from the south. It is navi^le finom Turin to the sea. The sand and gravel washed 
down from the mountains, have raised the bed of the river, in modem tiroes, to such an eleva* 
tioo, that in some places banks 30 feet high are necessary to preserve the country from inunda- 
tion. The Mige rises in the Alps of Tyrol, and flowing south, enters this territory, after 
which, it turns to the east, and falls into the Adriatic ; it is 200 miles in length. The Puive^ 
and several other small streams from the north, flow into the Adriatic. 

3. Lakes. Lag<^ Mfaggiore extends from Locarno, in the Swiss canton of Tesino, to S#> 
sto, in the Milanese, 37 miles ; it is 3 miles in width, and 1,800 feet deep. Its shores abound 
with Alpine beauties. In it lie the Borromean Isles, laid out in gardens and pleasure-grounda, 
and contamii^ handsome villas. East of this is the Lake of Como^ 32 miles in length ; and, 
ttill further east, the Lake of Garda, celebrated by Virgil under the name of Benacus ; it is 30 
aales kmg, and 8 miles wide. There are several other smaller lakes in the neighborhood. AU 
of them flow into the Po, and are highly beautiful. 

4. Climate and F^e of the Country. The country is for the most part level, but towards 
tlie Berth is broken by spurs of the Alps. To the west of Padua are the Euganean hills, from 
1,500 to 1,800 feet high, of volcanic origin. The climate is mild and healthy ; near the Alpe 
it is cold, and even in the other parts, the rivers are sometimes frozen in winter, and the 
iOQihero plants are injured by frosts. The heats of summer are tempered by refreshing breecct 
(m the Alps. 

5. SoU. Lombardy is a level country, and consists entirely of an alluvial plain, with one 
of the richest eoils in the world. Near the mountains, gravel is mixed with the earth) but al- 
Host the whole tract is composed of a deep black mould.

8. CanaU and Railroadr. The Lombardo- Venetian provinces coniain a great ntinilier of 
canals, pardy designed for navigation, and partly for irrigation ; there are not less than 243 in 
the government of Venice alone. The .^Taviglxo Grande and the Marttsana Canal have been 
mentioned in the general view of luly. The Cavanella Canal joins the Bianco to the Po. 
ind the Loreo Canal unites the Adige with the former. The Brenia Canal occupies tlie an- 
cient bed of the Brenta, the course of which was changed by the Venetians some centuries 
aince, to prevent its deposites from choking up their lagoons. An important project for a railroad 
through these provinces has lately been formed by the imperial government. This railroad viQ 
connect the 7 richest and most populous cities of Italy with each other, Venice, Padua. Viceo- 
n, Verona, Mantua, Brescia, and Milan ; the most gigantic portion will he the bridge over tbe 
lagoon^, connecting Venice with tbe main land. The length of the railroad will be 190 raiJeg, 
pissing through a population of three and a half miUions, the 7 cities having alone a population 
of halfa million. [This road is now completed. 1845.J 

7. JHliti. JUilan, tbe capital of the kingdom, and the residence of the viceroy, is t large 
ud splendid city, 11 miles in circumference. It stands in the middle of a vast plain, on a spot 

without any natural advantages, yet ibe 
fine canals from the Ticino and Addi, 
make it the centre of a considerable trade. 
It is considered the most elegant city in 
Italy, and was very much improved and 
beautified by Napoleon. The finest build- 
ing is the cathedral, which, after St. Pe- 
ter's, is the largest and roost sumptuouj 
church in Italy. It is built of pure white 
marble, and \ihi\e the exterior dazzles tbe 
beholder by the brilliancy of its maieria), 
the richness of its Gothic ornaments, and 
its 4,000 statues, he is not less struck 
with admiration by the splendid interior, 
resting upon 52 marble columns. Tbe 
college of Brera, now called the Royal 
Palace of the Sciences, with its fine [â€¢ 
brary of 170,000 volumes ; the viceregal 
Oirtfifrat f tmm. palace; the vast and magnificent bamcb; 

the theatre della Scala, one of the largest 
in tbe world ; the triumphal arch at the termination of the Simplon road, and tbe great bos' 
pital, with the numerous elegant palaces and houses of private persons, constitute some of the 
ornaments of this city. The literary institutions of Milan are in high repute. Its manufactures 
are extensive and various, comprising silks, jewelry, &c. Population, 205,000. Tbe hospi- 
tals and charitable institutions are numerous. Milan was founded 584 years before Christ, by 
tbe Insubrian Gauls. It has been 40 limes besieged ; 40 times taken, and 4 times destroyed. 
Itfaa.4 above 300 churches, and more than 100 monastic institutions. 

Brescia, situated in a fertile and highly cultivated plain, has extensive manufactures of silk, 
cutlery, and firearms. Population, 31,000. Bergamo, a manufacturing place, with a flourisb- 
ing trade in silk and iron, is remarkable for its great annual fair ; tbe fair hall is a large buildii^ 
containing 600 shops. Population 24,000. Cremona, on the Po, is a lai^e city, famous for its 
manufacture of violins. Its cathedral is a remarkable Gothic edifice of great dimensions, vitb 
one of the loftiest towers in Europe. Poifulation, 26,000. To (he north is -Lodi, with 18,000 
mbabitants, and manufactures of silk ana porcelain. The Parmesan cheese is made in the 
neighborhood. 

J\fantua, on a Ipke near the Mincio, is a large and handsome city, but its population, 27,000 
inhabitants, is disproportionate to its extent. Its situation and milicary works render it one of 
tbe strongest fortresses in Europe. In the neighborhood is shown the birthplace of Virfil. 
Pacta, on the Po, contains many elegant edifices, and a celebrated university. The Canbtf 
Â«an monastery, in its neighborhood, is one of the finest in Italy. Population, 21,000. 

Venice is certainly the most singular city in the world. It is built upon piles in the midst et 
a lai^e lagoon or lake, covered with a great number of litde isles, which are separated Crom eicb

Durow as to render the use of carriages impossible, the usual rehicle of traosportatioa is a sort 
of little bark called a gondola, which plies back and forth upon the caaals. A great Dumber of 
lumptuoos palaces still remind the visiter of the glorious times of the now fallen city, once the 
commercial capital of the world, the mistress of the seas, aad the cradle of modern civilization. 
Among ibe bridges is the famous Rielto, one of the most magnificent in Europe ; tt b 167 feet 



long, and of a single arch. There are 41 public squares, but that of St. Mbtk, surrounded oj 
s[deQdid buildings, and commanding a 6ne view of the sea, is the most remarkable. There 
iliod the church of St. Mark, an ancient building in the Oriental style, and the ducal palace, a 
mt and magnificent edifice, ornamented with the splendid masterpieces of the Venetian paint- 
en, and connected with the prisons called the leads {piombi, lead roofs), by the Bridge of 
Sigbs. The arsenal, long famous as the largest in Europe, still contains everj'thing necessary 
for equipping a fleet. There are several literary institutions and learned societies of reputation, 
uhI the library of St. Mark's is one of the richest in Italy. The commerce and manufactures 
of Venice, though much declined from iheir former importance, are yet considerable. The 
Inok trade is extensive, and glass, silk, woolen, and linen goods, artificial flowers, gold wire,

pendence of the inhabitants, but the impJenteaU 
and operations of husbandry are imperfect. The artificial irrigation of lands is a striking fea- 
ture of agriculture in Lombardy ; llie canals for this purpose are very numerous, and water is 
thus employed for grass and com lands and vineyards, and also to flood lands sown with rice. 
It is also used, when charged with mud, for depositing a layer of il as manure. The lands in 
Lombardy are generally farmed on the^etayer or half-profit system. The landlord pays the 
taxes and keeps the buildings in repair, while the tenant provides the .cattle, implements, aod 
seeds, and cultivates the ground, and the produce is equally divided. 

9. J^anufacturis and Trade. The chief manufactures are silk, glass, and hardware. At 
Venice and Murano, beautiful mirrors are made. Hardware and firearms are made at Brescii- 
Jewelry and plate are wrought at Milan and Venice. There are some manufactures of woo)Â«n, 
musical instrumenls, china, carpets, paper, artificial flowers, perfumes, vermicelli, macarcni, 
glass beads, &c. Venice has been made a free port, but its commerce is trifling. The inia- 
nal trade is pretty active. 

10. Governmtnt. RtUgion. Education. The government is arbitrary, and is administered 
by on Austrian viceroy. There is a show of representation, yet everything is controlled b; 
tfae authorities at Vienna. AH ihe taxes are imposed by the Emperor. The administrstioti 
of justice is arbitrary and wretched in the extreme, and the censorship is veryxigid. The re- 
ligion is the Roman Catholic. Education in this kingdom is wholly under the control of die

pncnunetit. Everj town is required to have its elementaiy school, which is ^pported it ths 
nnauctpal expense. The hieher schools are the gjntnasia, in which are taught the learned lan- 
guages lod netoric, and the I/ceums, to which are added history, and natunl philosophy. The 
unirentoes of Fadua and Pavia are among the most distinguished in Italy. 

II, Silery The nncient republic of Venice was founded in the 6th century, and from the 
Ditrslij bUnds of the Adnatic, it gradually extended its limits so as to embrace Â« lar^e portion 
of tiie neighboring continent. In the 13ih century, this republic bad become one of the most 
fiourishiDg and powerful States b the world. 
The discoreiy of the passage to India by the 
Portuguese, at the end of the 15th century, 
ruined the coomierce of Venice with the East, 
and irom that time, the republic began to de- 
cline. It bad become totally insignificant on 
the breaking out of the I'rench revolutionary 
wars, in the course of which, it fell into the 
bands of Austria. It wis long the custom of 
the Venetians, in sign of their dominion over 
the Adriatic, to celebrate a splendid pageant, 
which they called wedding the sea. The Slate 
galley, or Bucentaur. sumptuously adorned, and 
filled with the principal men of the republic, and 
accompanied by innumerable feluccas and gon- 
dolas, moved down to the mouth of the harbor, 
where the doge dropped a ring into the bosom 
of the sea, with these words, "we wed thee 
-^ with this ring, in token of our perpetual sove- 

reignty." But even this poor relic of departed 
glory bas perished ; "the spouseless Adriatic mourns her lord," and the Bucentaur lies rotting 
ia l&e aisenal. 

Lombardy was conquered by the Langobards or Lombards, id the 6th century, and made a 
Icingdom. Charlemagne annexed it to bis empire. The Miltinese was for a long time an ob- 
ject of contention between the French and Austnans. The Lembardo- Venetian kingdom, 
"iib its present limits, became fixed under the Austrian ride, at the Congress of Vienna, in 
April, 1815. 

CHAPTEK Xni. THE DUCHIES OF PARMA, MODENA, AND LUCCA. 

I. Boundariet, Extent, and Dwitioni. These three territories are distinct and indepen- 
dent of each other. They are bounded north by the Lombardo- Venetian kingdom ; east by 
ibe States of the church ; south by Tuscany, and west by the Mediterranean and the Sardinian 
lerriiory. 

3. Parma. This duchy comprises a surface of 3,300 square miles, and is washed on the 
>nr^m limit by the Po. The Apennines bound it on the south. The climate is temperate 
Md liealdiy. The soil is rich, and produces com, fruits, the vine and olive. Silk is every- 
vbere raised, and there Â«re manufactories of this article and of iron. The government is abso- 
lute, lad the duchy is divided into four districts. Maria Louisa, the widow of Napoleon, is the 
n^mni; ducbess. By a certain contingency, the country may fall to Austria and Sardinia. 
1Â» population is 430,000. 

i'orma, the capital, stands on a river of that name. Its walls are 3 or 4 miles in circumfe- 
^foce. The streets and squares are spacious, but they contain little that is remarkable for archi- 
iccture. Almost every other building is s church, rich within, but seldom finished without. 
Here are a imiversity, a public library of 110,000 volumes, and the celebrated Bodont press. 
Popobtion, 40,000. Piacima, on the Po, is a fortified town, occupied by Austrian troops. 
PojMilatioD, 28,000. The citadel is occupied by an Austrian garrison. 

3' ^odena. This duchy lies also upon the Po, to the east of Parma. It contains 3,100 
xiove mites. The climate is like that of Parma. The soil produces com and wine. The 
t is arbitrary, and the revenue is about 70,000 dollars. A military force of 1,600 men

ia maintained. The duchy is divided into three districts. It contains some iron mines, and 
stone and marble quarries. The population is 490,000. 

Mqdena^ the capital, stands in a pleasant plain, and has a neat, handsome appearance. Its 
general architecture is striking to a stranger, the greater part of the streets being built with opeo 
arcades. The ducal palace is a large and elegant structure, with a gallery of pictures and an- 
tiquities, and a library of 80,000 volumes. Here is also a university. Population, 26,800. 
Reggio^ a handsome town, with 18,000 inhabitants, was the birthplace of Ariosto. 

Massa stands on a small elevation a mile or two from the seashore. Its situation b perfectly 
delightful. At the entrance of the town, is the most beautiful bridge in the world, being a sin- 
gle arch of the finest proportions, built of the purest white marble. The ducal palace b a 
magnificent pile, fronted by a large inclosure bordered by orange trees. Population, 7,000. 

Catraray 5 miles distant, is an ill-built town, but growing rich from its commerce in fine 
statuary marble. Population, 6,000. 

4. Lucca. This duchy lies upon the Mediterranean, and is bounded on the south by Tus- 
cany. It contains 418 square miles, and a population of 143,000. It has a senate, which 
exercises the legislative power. The revenue is 288,000 dollars, and the military force, 1,400 
men. It is the most populous and best cultivated part of Italy. It is divided into three 
districts. Since 1847 it has been annexed to Tuscany. 

Lucca^ the capital, stands in a plain^ and is surrounded by walls. The towers of its churches, 
rising above the ramparts, have a fine eflTect in the rich and beautiful landscape ; the view is 
bounded by vine-clad hills, and spotted with villas, over which tower tlie craggy Apennines. 
The ramparts are planted with rows of trees, between which is an elevated road round the 
whole city. The streets are narrow and crooked, and the public buildings withour beauty. 
The churches are streaked and adorned with patches of different colored marble. Here is a 
university. Population, 22,000. 

CHAPTER XIV. PRINCIPALITY OF MONACO. 

This State, situated on the Sardinian coast, is under the protection of the king of Sardioia. 
It has an area of 50 square miles, with 6,500 inhabitants. The prince usuaHy resides m Paris. 

Monaco^ the capital, is a small town, built upon a rock, with 1,000 inhabitimts. The largest 
town in the principality is Mentoncj which has 3,000 inhabitants. 



CHAPTER XV. TUSCANY. 

1. Boundaries J Extent^ and Divisions. The Grand Duchy of Tuscany is boimded north 
and east by the Roman States, southwest by the Mediterranean, and northwest by Lucca. It 
contains 8,300 square miles, and is divided into 5 provinces, Florence, Pisa, Sienna, Arezio, 
and Grossetto, containing 36 towns, 135 villages, and 2,570 parishes. 

2. Rivers. The chief river is the â€¢Amo^ which rises among the mountains in the eastern 
part, and flows westerly to the sea. In summer, it is a shallow stream, flowing in the middle 
of a broad channel ; but when swelled by rains or the melting of the snows, it becomes a Iffoad 
and deep river. It is navigable by barges from Florence to the sea. It supplies with water 
above 1,000 canals. The Ombrone in the south, is not navigable. The Tiber rises in the 
mountains of this country. 

3. Islands. The island of Elba is 9 miles from the coast of Tuscany. It is 60 mQes ia 
circumference, and contains 160 square miles. It is very mountainous, and instead of wood, 
the mountains are covered with aromatic plants and bushes. The climate is mild, and the sea* 
sons change regularly ; autumn and winter are only distinguishable by the greater quantity of 
rain which falls. The chief production is iron, taken mostly from a single mountain, consisting 

, of one immense mass of iron-ore. The island contains also copper, lead, and silver mines, and 
produces excellent wine. The chief town, Porto Ferrajoj has a good harbor, and contains 
600 houses, all built of granite, with 3,000 inhabitants. In 1814, this island was given in en* 
tire sovereignty to Napoleon, who resided here from May, 1814, till February, 1815. Pop 
lation, 13,700. The island of Crotgona^ near Leghorn, is famous for the fishing of anchovies. 
4 CKmate The climate is exceedingly diversified. On the mountains the snow lies for 



nets during the winter ; id the valleys it scarcely coatmuea a day. Rain a :iot common, bat 
the dews are copious. On the Apennioea, and in the delightful valley of the Arno, the air is 
always healthy. In summer the southerly winds are very oppressive, and the region of the 
Marecoma is unhealthy. 

5. Soil. The vale of the Arao is rich and well cultivated. The soil on the Apennines is 
stony. The coast is low, sandy, and in some parts, swampy. In the southern part begins that 
''esolate regioo called the Maremma, the soil of which consists of white clay impregnated with 
sulphur and alum, and emits constantly mephitic vapors. The Malaria or unhealthy exhala- 
tions of this region have ohliged the population to emigrate, or swept them oS by disease. Id 
those parts which are cultivated, the peasants from the mountains come down to gather in the bar- 
rest, but they often fall victims to the insidious air. This region extends from near Leghorn lo 
Terracina, about 300 miles, and from the ses to the foot of the Apennines, Trom 35 to 30 miles. 

6. Miturali. Sulphur is produced here in great quantities, as also saltpetre, alum, and vitriol. 
The Tuscan marble is highly valued. 

7. Face of the Country. Tuscany li admired for its romantic scenery. The boldness, 
grandeur, and rich luxuriance of the country are hardly aoywhere equaled. The Valdarao or 
nie of ibe Amo is ooe of the most delightful regions in the world. One half of Tuscany 
coQsisls of mountains, producing only timber ; one sixth is composed of hills covered with 
rioGyards and olive gardens ; the remainder consists of plains. 

8. Citiet. Flortnce, the capital, stands on the Amo, 50 miles from the sea. It is 6 m^ 
ia compass, and, next to Rome,. is the most beautiful city in Italy. It is built in a plain skin- 
ed by the Apennines. Antique towers and remains of fortifications, old ctmvents, and other 
ptcluresque ruins crown the inferior eminences around the city, and recall the remark of Arios- 
to, that, OD seeing the hills, so full of palaces, it appears as if the soil produced tbem. The 
city is surrounded by walls ; the buildings are magnificeot, and the streets well paved and kept 
reinarkably cleao. The Via Larga or Broadway, is full of noble palaces. Most of the other 
nreets are narrow. The Ducal palace, the cathedral, the church of Santa Croce, and maoy 
oiiier edifices are noted for their size and splendor. The Medicean gallery is rich in those 
treasures of painting and sculpture, which draw to this city visiters from every quarter of the 
onlJMd globe. Here sUnds that Venus which enchants the world. The Magliabecchian libra- 
7 has 120,000 volumes ; others have 90,000 and 50,000. There are many splendid private 
galleries and libraries. Florence contaios a great number of English residents. It was the 
ciadle of the arts at the time of their regeneration, and the birthplace of Dante, Machiavelli, 
FHicaja, Guicciardini, Michael Angelo, Galileo, and Amerigo Vespucci. Population, 105,000. 

Pua, on the Amo, near the sea, was once the capital of a republic, the rival of Genoa and 

Venice. It is now decayed, but can 
still boast some iDarble churches, a mar- 
ble palace, and a marble bridge. Its an- 
cient towers may be traced in the walls 
of modem houses. The streets are 
broad, and the Lung' Amo, which ex- 
tends along both banks of the river, is 
much admired. The cathedral is a large 
Gothic edifice of marble. Near il 
stands that remarkable structure, the 
Leaning Toteer. It is 190 feet high, 
and overhangs its base 15 feet, seeming 
to threaten a fall at every instant ; yet, 
!. it has stood 400 years, and endured the 

! ' shock of earthquakes which have over- 

' thrown many a perpendicular stmcture."

Tuscany. It is a Deat, well-built, and busy toMrn, with a tolerable harbor. The streets are 
filled with Europeans, Turks, Jews, Armenians, Greeks, and Moors, exhibiting a most pie* 
turesque variety of costume. Works of art and architectural monuments do not exist here. 
The commerce of the place b very active. Population, 88,000. 

Sienna^ a large and handsome city, was also once the capital of a floivishing republic ; bat, 
like many other cities of Ital^, it is now much reduced, having only 18,000 inhabitants. Its 
university and academy of science have much celebrity. Pistaia has a celebrated manu&eto- 
ry of organs, and manufactures of wool, gold, silver, and firearms. Populidon, 12,000. 

9. Agriculture, Com, wine, and oil are common productions. The valley of the Arno 
is.divided into very small farms, separated by rows of trees or small canals. The Maremma 
pastures great numbers of sheep and horses. Chestnuts are an important production ; in some 
parts they are used for bread. 

10. Commerce^ Trade^ and Manufctctures. Tuscany is one of the most industrious coun- 
tries of Italy. Silk manufactures are the principal briinch of industry in the Florentine cities. 
Straw hats are made in great numbers by women, in the valley of the Arno. The other man- 
ufactures are linen, broadcloth, soap, perfumes, letter paper, china, marble, coral, alabaster, 
and mosaics. Leghorn has a considerable commerce with the Levant, Europe, and America. 

11. Government^ Population^ &c. The government b an absolute monarchy. The reve- 
nue is above 5,000,000 dollars. There are 5,500 regular troops, besides militia. Tuscany 
has no navy, and her vessels are protected by the Austrian flag. The population is 1,570,000. 
Of these 35,000 are Jews. 

12. Religion and Education. The religion of the people b Roman Catholic ; the number 
of priests is about 8,000, and education is exclusively in their hands. There are universities 
at Pisa, Florence, and Sienna. There are ako many secondary institutions or colleges, and 
females are instructed in the convents. Schools for elementary instruction have also been es- 
tablished in alt the towns, but though Tuscany is the best educated country in Italy, not one 
half of the population can read or write. 

13. History. Tuscany was anciently called Etruria. Florence, Pisa, and Sienna were, 
important republics during the middle ages. The Medici of Florence amassed great wealth 
by commerce, and finally obtained the sovereign authority of the city. This family became 
extmct in 1737, when the Grand Duchy passed to the DuJce of Lorrame. This territory was 
in 1792 made a republic under the name of the Commonwealth of Etruria. Afterwards it 
became the kingdom of Etruria, and then a part of the French empire. In 1814 the Gnud 
Duchy was reestablished. 

CHAPTER XVI. STATES OF THE CHURCH, OR THE PAPAL 

DOMINIONS. 

1. Boundaries^ Divisions^ &c. This territory occupies the centre of Italy. It is washed 
on the northeast by the Adriatic and on the southwest by the Mediterranean. On fne north it 
is bounded by the Lombardo- Venetian kingdom, on the southeast by the kingdom of Naples, 
and on the west by Modena and Tuscany. Its extreme length is 260 miles from north to 
south, and its breadth from 20 to 95 miles. It contains 17,500 square miles. The Ducbf 
of Benevento, and the principality of Ponte Corvo are two small districts belonging to this 
territory, insulated in the kingdom of Naples. ^ ; 

2. Rivers. The Tiber^ though not the largest stream in Italy, is the first in classical ^leb- 
rity. It rises in the Apennines, near the source of the Arno, and passes through the city of 
Rome to the Mediterranean ; it is 200 miles in length, and has a full stream but narrow ; it is 
only 300 feet wide at Rome. There is no other river of importance within this territory. The 
northern boundary is washed by the Po. 

3. Lakes. The lake of Perugia near the city of that name, is the ancient Thrasymenus, 
and is famous for a battle between Hannibal and the Romans. It is a beautiful sheet of water, 
4 miles across, bordered with gently sloping hills, everywhere covered with woods or cultivated 
fields, and rising at a distance into mountains. The lakes of Albano and J^emi are charmingly 
situated among hills. There are other small lakes. 

4. Climate. The climate is mild, but the mountains are covered with snow from October 



STATES OP THE CHUItCH. SU 

n April. The ISincet, or hot wind from Africa, is felt on the shore of the Medhenanean. 
In the mooataiDous parts the air is healthy, but in the Maremina on the coast, and m the tie^b- 
borhood of the Pontine marshes, are pestilentiaJ ezhalatioos, which cause fever and ague. The 
DOrdiem parts near the Po are also uDfaealthy. 

5. Soil The soil does not diÂ£Fer materially from that of Tuscany. The orasf^es and 
loDoas produced in the plain of Rome are the heal in Italy. 

6. Rfu of the Country. This territory is intersected by the Apemiinea, The mouutaini 
ire as barren as those of Tuscany and Genoa, but higher. The CainpagDa di Roma is a con- 
dnuilion of the Tuscan Maremma, and is noted for its unhealthy malaria. It exhibits an UD- 
dulited surface bare of trees. The Pontine marshes are in the south. The ancient Cesart 
ud modern Popes have in vain attempted to drain them. 

7. Jifatural Curiosities. The cataract of Velino near Temi, is a beautifully picturesque 
cascade, and has been celebrated in the verses of Byron. It is, however, partly artificial. 
Tiie mountain stream of the Velino was turned into the Nar through a bed cut in a limestone 
iDck.* The cascade of Tivoli is also artificial. 

S. Dinnons. The States of the Church are divided into 31 provinces, bearing the names 
of their chief towns. The province of Rome is styled comarca or country ; those of Bologna, 
Ferrara, Ravenna, Urbino, Pesdro, Forli, and Velleiri, Legations ; Loretto is called a Com- 
misanat, and the other thirteen delegations. 
9. Town*. Rome, the capital of the State, stands upon both sides of the Tiber, 15 miles 
from the sea. It is situated on several low bills, 
and is 16 miles in circumference, comprehend- 
ing, however, within this space much open 
ground, gardens, vineyards, and fields. Once 
the capital of an empire, which embraced nearly 
the whole of the known world, and for centuries, 
the residence of the popes, who have adorned it 
with all the splendors of painting, sculpture, and 
architecture, there is no place that can compare 
wirh Rome in its majestic ruins, its associa- 
tions with the past, the solemn grandeur of its 
churches and palaces, and its endless treasures 
of art. It has, indeed, a sombre appearance, 
p- fMnd B rendered still more striking by large squares, spa- 

"^y cious and deserted streets, and the majestic ruins 

which are seen at every step. Some of the streets are of immense length ; others are only 
batr buih ; many are narrow and crooked. In one part are noble palaces half hidden among 
miserable huts. In another part all is gorgeous and magnificent. Other places may be more 
Iwntiful, but Rome is one of the most richly picturesque cities in the world. The hills, in- 
ligoiQcant in themselves, seem made to 'display the buildings lo the greatest advantage. The 
irtiiitecture, both ancient and modern, is often faulty and incongruous, but always combines 
"^with the landscape. The spectator Is dazzled with the multiplicity of objects, and de- 
wjing ruins are relieved by modern magnificence. It contains at present a population of 
184,0()O souls, 364 churches, 30 monasteries, 46 public squares, and 125 palaces. The mod- 
en) city is a httle north of ancient Rome, the site of which is principally covered with gardens 
â– nd vineyards. Fifteen gates, several of which are distinguished for their magnificence, form

the entnnces into the ci^. Several of the priocipal streets' are spacious and of great la^; 
among these is die Corso, in which the races are held, and which Ibrins the favorite promraaiie 
of the Romans. 

The church of St. Peter, built at the expense of the whole Roman world, is the glory of 
modem archliecture. The symmetry and 
beau^ of its proportions cause such sen- 
sations of delight, that the traveler, oa 
leaving Rome, finds his most paJaful regret 
to be that he shall see St. Peter's no 
more. It is fronted by a circular colon- 
nade surrounding an Egyptian obelisli ind 
3 magnificent fountains. The immense 
dome, the boldest work of modem archi- 
tecture, rises to the height of 530 feel ; 
under this is the high aliar, with a colossal 
canopy, supported by 4 bronze pillars, 130 
feet in height. The church was 11 1 yean 
in building, and cost a sum equal to 
160,000,000 dollars at the present day, 
No other church in Rome can be com- 
<^*Â»"* "/ *â–  ^'**^- pared to this, yet there are many remarka- 

ble for magnificence and antiquity. The Pantheon is the most perfect edifice of ancient Rome ; 
it is now converted into a church ; its portico is unrivaled. The St. John's of Lateran, in 
which the Popes are crowned, and Great St. Mary's, are also magnificent edifices. 

The winter residence of the popes is the Vatican, the largest palace in Europe, containing 
4,420 halls and galleries, filled with tbe treasures of ancient and modem art. The library a 
one of tbe largest and richest in ihe world. The Quirinal palace Is the summer residence, and 
its gardens are the most beautiful in Italy. The palaces of the rich Romans, and the villas, or 
palaces surrounded with gardens, groves, and parks, resemble rather the residences of prmees, 
than of private individuals ; and many of them are adorned with a profusion of the finest works 
of statuary and paintbg ; the edifices themselves are the productions of tbe greatest geoiusej 
of modem times. 

The number of literary institutions and societies in Rome is very great, and there are acade* 
mies for all branches of the fine arts. The University della Sapienza, the Roman College, tbe 
Propaganda, for the education of roissiooaries, and 31 colleges, are tbe chief establishmenti 
for education. 

There are many remarkable monuments of ancient Rome, which should not be for- 
gotten in an account of the modem cirr. 
The ^lian bridge over the Tiber, now 
called the bridge of St. Angelo, is one of 
tbe finest in Italy- The mausoleum of 
Adrian, a rounded pyramid of white lott- 
ble, called also from its great size Adrian's 
Mole, now bears the name of theCasileof 
St. Angelo ; it has been converted ioto a 
citadel, and in it are kept the treasures of 
the popes, and the bulls and documents of 
the papal court ; the prisoners of state are 
also confined here. The Coliseum, a vast 
amphitheatre, 1,600 feet in circumference, 
ana capable of containing 100,000 specta- 
tors, is much decayed.* Several lempfes, 
the columns of Antonine and Trajan, llw 
triumphal arches of Tiius and Constaniine, 
and numerous obelisks are in good preset

TatiOQ. The Cloaca Maxima or Great Sewer is of colossal dimensions, and is one of the 
oldest Roman constructions ; it is composed of enormous stones, and its vaults are from 10 
to 16 feet high, and from 12 to 14 wide. 

Bohgnaj a large acd handsome city, delightfully situated at the foot of the Apennines, is the 
second town of the State. The houses are mostly built of stone with arcades in front, so that 
foot-passencers can pass through the city under cover. There are many churches and palaces 
here remarKable for their architecture and their treasures of statuary and painting. Bologna 
has long been famous for its learned institutions, and the university is the oldest in Europe, 
and one of the best in Italy. The Scientific Institute is a magnificent institution, with a rich 
library of 160,000 volumes, an observatory, and valuable cabinets of art and science. Popu- 
lation, 71,000. 

Ferrara^ to the north of Bologna, is a large and superb city, but is rendered unhealthy by 
the marshes which surround it ; it is now half deserted, and the grass grows in front of its noÂ« 
ble palaces. Its polished court was once the resort of the most famous wits of Italy, and there 
are a university and a valuable library here. Ferrara contains a strong citadel, now occupied 
by Austrian troops. Population 24,000. 

Ravenna^ formerly a populous city, and successively the residence of the emperors of the 
Western Roman Empire, of the Gothic kings, and of the exarchs of Italy, is now much re- 
duced. The neighboring marshes render it unhealthy, and its fine port, in which the Roman 
fleets wintered, is now filled up with mud. It still contains many remains of its ancient mag- 
nificence, and here repose the bones of the divine Dante. Population, 16,000. 

Rimini^ is a large and handsome city, containing numerous remains of antiquity and several 
6ne churches. Its harbor is now choked up, and the sea has receded more than two miles 
from the ancient lighthouse. Population, 15,000. ^ncona^ is a place of considerable com- 
merce, with a good harbor upon the gulf of Venice. Its manufactures are also extensive ; 
population 30,000. Sinigagliay to the north of Ancona, with 8,000 inhabitants, is famous 
for its fair. LorettOy to the south, is celebrated for its cathedral, in which is shown the house 
of the Virgin Mary, said to have been brought hither by angels. 

Ptrugia^ situated upon the Tiber, in the midst of a fertile and highly cultivated district, con- 
tains a university, and has a population of 30,000 inhabitants. Its silk manufactures are im- 
portant, and its library, museum of antiquities, ruins, &c., render it interesting. Civita 
Vecchiay on the Western coast, with 7,000 inhabitants, is a strongly fortified port, with a dock- 
prd, and considerable commerce. BeneventOy within the Neapolitan territories, with 14,000 
inhabitants ; Spoleto^ 7,000 inhabitants ; and Urbino^ 7,000, are interesting from the important 
part they have played in the history of modem Italy. 
10. Agriculture, The lands are commonly held by great proprietors. In the plain of the 
Po, cultivation is active, but the rest of the country is neglected. The Romans are less in- 
dustrious than their northern neighbors. The vine and olive grow everywhere. Onions are 
raised m immense quantities in the marshes of Ancona. Hemp, saffron, and beans are exten- 
sively cultivated. 

11. Commerce and Manufactures. The commerce is chiefly in the hands of foreigners, 
and the only seaport of consequence is Civita Vecchia. The manufactures merely supply the 
home consumption. Some silk is manufactured at Bologna, besides many miscellaneous arti 
cles. Gallnuts and cantharides are articles of exportation. 

12. Government. The government is an elective monarchy. The pope possesses both 
the legislative and executive power, and is chosen by the College of Cardinals from among 
themselves. The number of cardinals is about 70. Constitutionally, the pope is an absolute 
sovereign, but in practice he is only the head of an oligarchy. Since the tune of Adrian the 
Sixth, who was obtruded upon the throne by Charles the Fifth, all the popes have been 
Italians. 

' 13 Revenue, Army, &c. The revenue is 10,000,000 dollars. The debt is 34,000,000. 
The military force is about 9,000 men. There is no navy. The population is 2,590,940. 

14 . History. The cradle of the ancient Roman republic is now become the seat of the 
spiritual head of the religion of peace. The Roman power, by an almost uninten'upted 
series of wars for centuries, during which 300 triumphs celebrated the victories of their arms 
bf sea and land, was gradually spread all over the countries bordering on the Mediterranean, 
in Asia, Africa, and Europe. After the decline of this colossus, the name of Rome was 
stiD venerated by the world, and the bishop of Rome, better known by the title of pope, came to

be looked opon as a sort of 
head of the Chnsiian cliurch. 
The pope claims the bfiy 
title of successor of St. Pe- 
ter, and God's vScegerew 
upon earth. The supremacf 
of the apostolic see at Rome, 
dates from a reniote period. 
The pope first acquired claim 
to territorial doinnion from 
the donation ofCharlemagDe 
ibout A. D. SOO ; but not till 
the 1 5th century, was the p- 
pal authority esiabtisbed over 
what now consliiuiesihe pat- 
rimony of St. Peter ; Ancnni 
and Urbitio were oblaiiied in 
thelCthandI7th. Though 
the papal terrhories were 
AncUat Rmaa Wan. inconsiderable, yet the popes 

maintained armies, and exerted great influence in the afTtirs of Europe. Their power received i 
blow by the Reformation in tne 16tb centuiy, and the papal authority is now quite insignlQcanL 
One of the consequences of the invasion of Italy by Bonaparte In ]79fi, was the overihrow of 
the Pope, and the establishment of a republic in Rome; but this government was of short 
continuance. The Roman States were annexed to Napoleon's Kingdom of Italy in 180S, and 
in 1810 they were united to the French Empire. In 1814 the pope was restored to all his for- 
mer possessions. ' 

CHAPTER XVir. REPUBLIC OF SAN MARINO. 

This little republic is an independent State, but is under the protection of the pope, and is 
inclosed in the Papal States. It consists of a mountainous tract among the Apennines, con- 
taining 22 square miles, and a population of 8,300. It is productive in wine and corn. The 
town of San Marino stands on the summit of a mountain, and is accessible only by a narrow 
path. The constitution is a mixture of aristocracy and democracy. The punishment of dealb 
has never been inflicted within this territory. 

CHAPTER XVllI. THE KINGDOM OF NAPLES, OR KINGDOM OF 

THE TWO SICILIES. 

1. Boundaries, Extent, &c. This kingdom comprises all the south of Italy, with the 
Island of Sicily, and a few small islands in the neighborhood. The continental portion is 
bounded northwest by the States of the Church ; northeast by the Adriatic ; southeast by the 
Ionian sea, and southwest by the Mediterranean. It extends from 37Â° 50* to 42Â° 55' N. lati- 
tude ; and from 13Â° to 19Â° E. longitude. Its extreme length is about 360 miles. Its width 
varies from 20 to 8 miles. The Island of Sicily is separated by a narrow strait from the 
southern extremity of the continent ; it extends from 36Â° 40* to 38Â° 15' N. latitude ; and from 
12^30" to 15Â° 40* E. longitude ; its extreme length being 250 miles. The contineiital part 
COQtains 32,000 square miles, and the island 10,200. Total 42,200. 

2. Mountains. The continental part is traversed from north to South by the ^pennttwi, 
which terminate at the Straits of Messina, separating Sicily from the continent. The highest 
summit. Mount Conto, or Cavallo, reaches the height of 9,520 feet. Vesuvius, a volcffliJC 
mountain near the city of Naples, 3,450 feet high, belongs to this chain. The first recorded 
eruption of Vesuvius was in A, D. 63, a few years after which it overwhelmed the 2 
large and populous cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum with lava and ashes. Since that 
period, it has been in constant activity, ttad has frequently caused great ravages. Its

sides are mostly barren, \nit in some pans vines 
and fruits are seen amidst Gelds of burning lava, 
and its base is inhabited and cultivated. Sicily 
contains two ridges extending across the island ; 
the one from east to west, in which is the volcanic 
Mount Etna, or Moagibello, ]0,870feet high, and 
the other ham north to south. 

3. Jlivers and Lakes. The rivers descend from 
each side of the Apennines into the sea. They 
are all small ; the VoUumo and the GarigHanot 
Bowing west into the Mediterranean, are the princi- 
pal. The principal lake is Celano, in the northern 
part of the kingdom. 

4. Islands. Sicily is the largest bland in the 
Mediterranean. ItÂ«s shaped like a triangle, and 

tns called, in consequence, Tnnacria by the ancient Greeks. It seems to have been 
sepualed from the continent by some violent convulsion. The Strait of Messina, dividing it 
from the continent, is 5 miles broad. This is the ancient Charyhdis, although the whirlpool 
which rendered it such a terror to mariners, no longer exists. The mountains of this island 
may be regarded as a continuation of the Apennines. Mount JEUia is near the eastern shore. 
This celebrated volcano has thrown out 
flames, at intervals, for more than 2,000 
years. Its immense size and solitary ele- 
vation, the beauty and magniGceoce of the 
surrounding scenery, and the terrific gran- 
deur of the convulsions to which it has been 
subject, have made it one of the wonders 
of the world. At a distance, it appears 
like a truncated cone. Upon a nearer ap- 
proach, the traveler is astonished at the 
wild and grotesque appearance of the whole 
mountain. Scattered over the immense 
declivity, he beholds innumerable small co- 
nical hills gently rising from the surface to 
the height of 400 or 600 feet, covered with 
rich verdure and beautiful trees, villages, 
scattered haralels, and monasteries. As 
bis eye ascends, he discovers an immense 
forest of oaks and pines, forming a beauti- 
ful green belt round the mountain. Above 
this, appears the hoary head of the volcano, 
xouni Xtna. boldly rising into the clouds, and capped 

with eternal snow. The crater is a bill of 
n exact conical figure, composed of ashes and scoriÂ». From this opening, smoke is continu- 
ally ascending.* There are several mud volcanoes in the island. The principal one is at

mNGDCM OF NAPLES. 



Maccaluba, near GirgeDti. The rivers of Sicily are mere rivulets. The heavy winter nas 
set the mountaio torrents running, but when dry, their beds become tolerable roads, to the dis* 
tance of 3 or 4 miles inland. 

The Lipari Islands lie between Sicily and the continent. They are 12 in number ; a part 
of them only are inhabited. Lipariy the principal isle, contains 112 square miles ; it is moun- 
tainous, and the soil is rendered fertile by a subterranean fire. There was once a volcano here* 
The island of Stromboli is a volcano, that bums without ceasing. Volcano constantly emits 
smoke. The island of Capri in the Bay of Naples, contains 10 square miles. It consists of 
two high rocky mountains, enc.osing a fertile valley. In the time of the Romans, it was adorned 
with magnificent palaces. Ischia and Procida are fertile islands, in the same neighborhood. 

5. Bays and Gulfs. The Gulf of Taranto is a semicirculdir bay at the soutbeastera ex 
tremity of Italy ; it is 100 miles in extent. The bays of Miples and SakmOy on the westein 
coast, are much smaller. 

6. Climate. On the continent, a perpetual spring seems to prevail. Vegetation b never 
interrupted ; in the depth of waiter, the fields are green, the orange trees in blossom, the balmy 
air is filled with the fragrance of blooming shrubs and flowers, and the sea reflects a clear, blue 
sky. From May to September the heat is intense. On the highest mountains the snow some- 
times lies from October till May. In Sicily, the heat of summer is diminbhed by sea-breezes, 
but when the Sirocco blows, all vegetation dies away. Rain seldom falls, but the dews are coÂ« 
pious. The nights are cold, but it never freezes except upon the mountains. 

7. Soil, There b an indescribable richness of vegetation throughout thb country. Here 
flourish the fig-tree, the almond, the cotton plant, and sugar-cane. Sicily is one of the most 
productive spots on the earth. The soil is calcareous, and its fertility b much increased bj 
volcanic fire. 

8. Jifinerals. This country does not appear to be rich in minerals, and among those that 
have been dbcovered, few are wrought. There are some iron mines near Naples, and sulphur, 
alum, marble, alabaster, puzzolana, and salt are produced here. 

9. Divisions. The kingdom is divided into 22 provinces, which are subdivided mto 75 
districts. Of the former, 15 are in the continental part, and compose the Domsuns this side 
the Faro (Domini al di qua del Faro) ; and 7 in Sicily, constituting the Domains beyond the 
Faro. The Sicilian provinces are Palermo, Messina, Catania, Syracuse, Caltanisetta, and 
Trapani, called from their chief towns. Those of Naples are the First and Second Farther 
Abruzzo, Hither Abruzzo, Terra di Lavoro, Molise, Naples, the Farther and Hither Priaci- 
pato, Capitanata, Bari, Otranto, Basilicata, the First and Second Farther Calabria, and Hither 
Calabria. 

10. Cities, ^aplesj the capital, is the largest city in Italy. It stands at the bottom of a 
bay, and with it| suburbs and contiguous villages extends 6 or 8 miles along the water. On 
the land side it is surrounded by mountains. Nothing can surpass the beauty of the bay or the 
prospect of the city viewed from the water, where it appears broken into great masses, and 
crossed by long lines of palaces, banging gardens, and terraced roofs ; the outline upon the sea 
b strikingly indented, the shipping is clustered behind the moles, and castles and towers rise oo 
the points of projection. The shores of the bay are covered with interesting ruins, and broken 
into graceful inlets. The dark towering summit of Vesuvius rises, frowning over the landscape, 
while its lower regions are covered wich the richest vegetation, and dotted with white country 
houses. The whole circuit of the bay is edged with white towns, and covered with cultiva- 



the moanttun, irritate hiÂ« Inngi, and threaten suffocation. 
Clouds of smoke, issuing from the crater, roU down its 
tide, and involve hftn in a pitchy atmosphere ; and to add 
to the horror of the scene, terrinc nounds are continually 
issuing from the very centre of the niountain.resounding 
like discharges of artillery in the vast abvss. This part of 
the journey is generally performed in the night, in order 
to arrive at the summit at an early hour. The traveler, 
an hour before sunrise, reaches a ruined structure called 
the Philosopher's Tower. Here, sheltered from the fury 
of the blast, he may sit down to recruit his exhausted 
strength, and examine the objects around him. The for- 
ests below still appear like a dark ffulf encompassing the 
mountain ; the unclouded sky is fainUy irradiated, and 
the immense vault of heaven is stretched above in awful 
majesty. Tha itan wetna increased in number and magni- 



tude, and their liffht appears uncommonly bright, while 
the milky way shoots across the heavens like a pare 
flame. On ascending the summit of the crater, all that is 
wonderful, sublime, and beautiful in nature bursts upon 
the astonished eye." â€” Bell. 

The diameter of the visible horizon from this spot, n 
260 miles. The island of Malta appears on the edge of the 
horizon ; but it is not true, as stated by Brydone, that the 
African coast may be discovered. The nÂ«ate8t eruption ' 
of iEtna, in late years, took place in 1812. Another, in 
1819,- formed a current of lava 60 feet in breadth on the 
mountain, and 1,200 at its base. It desolated the counttT 
to the distance of six miles, and set fire to the trees wbicli 
it touched. Stones were thrown out of the cratfir to the 
height of 1,000 feet

tifio nd the atundsnce of nature. The ma^ificence of tfae whole scene is beyond the moai 
|orgeoui description. 

The streets of the city are strait but narrow ; some are refreshed with fountaios ; others are 
decorated with statues and sculptured obeUsks. The bouses are high, the roofs flat, more than 
half the front consists ol windows, and every window is faced with an iron balcony. Naples 
in its interior has do parallel on earth. The whole population is out of doors and in incessant 
motion ; no street in London or Paris has anyihing comparable to it ; it is one everlasting tu- 
mult. The Strada di Toledo is a perpetual fair, and on Sundays the crowd is so immense 
that it is difficult to walk through it. This street is very splendid, and the shops gay and 
sbowy. Erery trade, occupation, and amusement is here going on in the midst of a tumultu- 
ous crowd rolling up and down. In this region of caricature, every bargain sounds like a bat- 
lie ; the popular exhibitions are full of the grotesque, and some of the church processions 
would frighten a war-horse. The Mole is on holydays an epitome of the city, and exhibits 
most of its humors. The number of laxzaroni, or vagabonds, is immense. They are idle 
fioin choice ; their tatters are not misery, for the cUmate requires hardly any covermg, and 3 
cents ytlue of macaroni is sufficient food for a day. 

8ix stroi^ castles defend the city, and an excellent mole shelters the port. The commerce 
is not very active. There are above 300 churches in Naples, remarkable for their ornaments 
md rich jewelry. The nobility are numerous and are much addicted to show and parade ; 
100 of them have the title of princes. Population, 400,000.* 

The environs of Naples combine almost everythibg grand and beautiful. Many of the towns 
Kittered along the bay have 10 and 15,000 inhabitants. Mount Vesuvius, which forms so 

striking a feature in the landscape, 
rises in a pyramidal form, on the east, 
in the midst of a large plain. The 
traveler, in ascending it, passes among 
cultivated fields and vineyards, trav- 
ersed by old streams of lava, black, 
rough, and sterile. f The ascent is 
gradual and extends 3 miles. On one 
side the mountain is cultivated nearly 
to the top. The conical summit is 
composed of ashes and cinders. The 
crater is about a mile in circuit, and 
â– is 3,800 feet above the sea. The 
view from the summit is enchanting. 
The soil of the mountain is extreme- 
jfoaK rÂ«Â«rÂ«Â«. 'y fÂ«"'!^' *"'' cultivated with the 

spade hke a garden. The crater' 
ihrows out continual smoke, and often bursts forth in terrible eruptions. In this direction are 
Portici, Herculaneum, and Pompeii. 

On the west is Mount Paufilippo, through which is cut the tunnel or arched way, called the 
groito of Pausiiippo, 90 feet high, 30 feet wide, and upwards of a mile long. Passing through 
ibis tunnel you come to the lake of .3gnano, which emits sulphureous vapors, and has the sin- 
ED-'ir property of boiling up in some places, without being hot. On its banks is the Grotta del 
Cane or Dog's Grotto, the bottom of which Is covered with carbonic acid gas. On plunging

rose out of the ground in 1588, to the height of 500 feet. Here is also Baim, once a iavorite 
resort of the Romans, now covered with magnificent ruins. On the east the road leads tÂ» 
Portici, Vesuvius, Herculaneum, and Pompeii. At the foot of Vesuvius is Torre del Greco^ 
a considerable town, with 13,000 inhabitants. 

Near the coast, to the south, are Cava, with extensive manufactures, a celebrated monastery, 
and 20,000 inhabitants ; SalernOj a commercial city, renowned for its ancient medical school) 
with 11,000 inhabitants ; and Jlmalji, now a little village with 3,000 inhabitants, but intereBt- 
ing from its historical importance. Further south stand the magnificent ruins of PcMtum, an 
ancient Greek city, celebrated by the poets for the fragrance of its twice-blowing roses, and its 
mild and balmy air. The remains of 3 temples of a colossal sise and beautiful architecture 
were discovered here m 1755, and in 1830 a whole street, lined with a long colonnade, wu 
found. 

Bariy on the Adriatic, has a good harbor and considerable commerce, with 19,000 inhabit* 
ants. Lecce, 14,000 inhabitants, Tarentumy 14,000, and ReggiOy with 17,000, are importaBt

Trani, on the Adriatic, remarkable for its cathedral, with 14,000 inhabitants, and Barletta^ 
noted for its salt works, and its flourishing Commerce, with 18,000 inhabitants, are also impo^ 
tant towns. 

Palermo^ the capital of Sicily, stands on a small bay in the northwestern part of the island. 
The streets are regular and wide ; the'houses elegant, and several of the public squares very 
beautiful. The city is built in a semicircular plain or valley surrounded by mountains. This 
little nook of land is called Conca d' Oro, or the '^ Golden Shell," and abounds with flagrant 
groves of orange trees and acacias. Palermo has a university and considerable commerce. 
Population, 180,000. 

Catania stands at the foot of Mount ^tna^ Its streets are strait, spacious, and paved with 
hva. It is the busiest town in Sicily, and has a university, public library, museums, acade- 
aiies, &c. It was founded 700 years before the Christian era, and has suffered severely from 
wuptions of the mountain and from earthquakes. Population, 60,100. 

Messinay upon the strait of that name, at the normeastem extremity of Sicily, is regularly 
built, and has one of the best harbors in the Mediterranean. Its fine quay extends more than 
a mile along the port. It is the first commercial town in the kingdom, and its trade extends to 
the North of Europe and America. It was completely destroyed by an earthquake in 1783, 
but has been rebuilt. Population, 85,000. 

Syraewty on the eastern coast of the island, is a strongly fortified town, with a good harbor. 
It has many Grecian antiquities. Population, 15,000. Girgeniiy the ancient Agrigentum, on 
the south coast, has an indifferent harbor, but considerable trade. Population, 14,882. Tm- 
pant, at the western extremity, has some commerce and coral fisheries. Population, 24,330. 
Marsalay on the western coast, south of Trapani, is noted for its wines. Population, 21,000. 
Caltagironey with 20,000 inhabitants, near the southern coast, is important for its manufactures 
and commerce. 

11. Agriculture. The land belongs mostly to the clergy and nobles; tbe cultivators arÂ« 
poor, and the country is imperfectly cultivated. On the continent wine, oil, silk, wheat, and 
maize, with the various fruits of warm regions, are produced ; in Sicily they raise the same 
articles, with flax and hemp. 

12. Commerce and Manufactures. The maritime commerce is confined chiefly to the ex* 
portation of natural productions, and is mostly carried on by foreigners. Inland trade is ob- 
structed by the want of good roads, navigable rivers and canals. Manufactures are more 
flourishing in Naples than in Sicily. The silk, woolen, and cotton manufactures are consider- 
able ; linen, metallic wares, and articles of marble, and precious stones, are also produced. 

13. Government. The government is an absolute monarchy, hereditary in the male and fe- 
male line. The revenue is about 15,000,000 dollars, the debt 100,000,000. The army con- 
sists of 60,000 men ; the navy of 1 ship of the line, 3 frigates, and 8 smaller vessels. 

14. Religion, The religion of the natives is the Roman Catholic, but there are some Jews, 
and members of the Greek Church. The clergy are in possession of nearly two thirds of the 



IONIAN iSLANDa 849 

Med property of tbe kingdom. There arc 16 archbishops, 77 bishops, 410 abbots and priors, 
32 secular priests, and about 22 monks and nans. 

15. EdwMioH. There are four universities, at Naples, Palermo, Catania, and Messina. 
Tbe principal towns both of Naples and Sicily all have lyceums for preparatory instruction, and 
eqiedally for classical studies. Some pr mary schools have been established in Sicily, but the 
conxnon people are extremely ignprant. 

16. mstory. This part of Italy was anciently occupied by Greek colonies, who covered 
it with flourishing and splendid cities. It afterward formed part of the Roman Empire, and 
siAsequently underwent various vicissitudes, and belonged to different foreign powers. The 
Norman knights who expelled the Greeks and Saracens from this country in the lllh century, 
were the founders of the kingdom of Naples. Roger the Second, in 1130 assumed the title 
of King of Naples and Sicily. The better to co^rm his tide he received the kingdom as a 
fcif from the Pope. From Uiis period tiU within a few years, the Roman Pontiff has received 
an annual fee of a horse and a purse of ducats, as an acknowledgment of liege duty from the 
king of Naples. The sovereignty was even transferred by the Pope to the House of Anjou. 
Sicily came into the hands of the king of Arragon in the 13th century, and the two countries 
were divided for some time. Ferdinand the Catholic conquered Naples, and for two centuries 
the united kingdom remained a Spanish province. Naples fell to Austria at the peace of 
Utrecht, but was re-conouered by Spain, and in 1759 became an independent kingdom under a 
Spuish prince. The French revolution caused the establishment of the Parthenopeian Re' 
fubUe at Naples, in 1799, but this was quickly overthrown. Napoleon gave the kingdom of 
Naples to his brother Joseph, in 1806, and transferred it to his brother-in-law Murat, in 1808, 
but the year of Waterloo restored the ancient king. In 1820 a constitution was accepted and 
sworn to by tbe king, but an Austrian army abolished it af the point of the bayonet. 

CHAPTER XIX. THE IONIAN ISLANDS, MALTA, AND GOZZO. 

fonian Republic. This republic consists of several islands,* lying near the coast of Greece 
and Albania, between 35Â° 60' and 39Â° 57' N. latitude. They contain 1,000 square miles, 
and 240,000 inhabitants. The republic is in fact a dependency of Great Britain, having been 
placed under the immediate protection of that power by the Congress of Vienna, in 1815, 
There is a legislative assembly consisting of representatives from the several islands, but their 
acts are subjected to the approbation of a British Lord High Commissioner. The British also 
maiDtain garrisons in all the fortresses, and all the military forces of the republic are under the 
direction of the British commander-in-chief. The inhabitants are Greeks, with some Italians 
and Jews. The climate is mild, and the olive, lemon, orange, and fig flourish throughout the 
year. The revenue of the republic is about 450,000 dollars ; the national militia, 1,600 men, 
&od tbe British troops in the different garrisons amount to 4,400. 

Cor/ti. This island is the Phoeacia sung by Homer ; it is separated from the mainland of 
Albania by a strait 6 miles in width, obstructed by shoals. It is 60 miles in length and 30 in 
extreme breadth, and contains a population of 70,000. The chief wealth consists in olive 
trees, of which the islands contain 3,000,000. The oil yearly exported amounts to 300,000 
jars, containing 33 pounds each. Com and wine are also produced in small quantities. The 
town of Corfu contains 25,000 inhabitants, and has a harbor strongly fortified. Here is a col- 
lege with a library of 30,000 volumes. Paxo lies 8 miles southeast of Corfu. It is 7 miles 
long and 3 broad, and nearly covered with olive trees. It has some commerce and a population 
of 4,000. 

Santa Maura is the ancient Leucadia ; the channel which separates it from the continent is 
poly 50 paces broad, and was cut by the Carthaginians or Corinthians. The island is 50 miles 
in compass, and contains 22,000 inhabitants, â€¢imaxiki,^ the principal town, has a population of 
5,500. Cephalonia is the largest of the group ; it is 40 miles in length and 30 in mean breadth, 
containing 364 square miles and 70,000 inhabitants. A lofty ridge passes across it, one of the 

Elks of which is 4,000 feet in height. Oil, muscadine wine, cotton and honey are produced 
e, and the inhabitants have some manufactures. Argostoli^ its capital, has 5,000 inhabitants.

24 miles long and half as broad. It is pleasant and fertile. Its chief production is cumnts, 
of which it exports annually 7,000,000 or 8,000,000 pounds, being somewhat more ihan hitf 
(he quantity produced in all the Ionian islands. Here is a^spring of bitumen which aSorii

width. It is twenty, 
four miles in circuit, 
and produces sugar* 
cane. Its popula- 
tion is 19,300. The 
capital is Rabatto. 
Comino lies between 
Malta and Gozzo ; 
it is fortified and bas

These islands were possessed by the Cartbaginians, Romans, and Saracens, successive- 
ly. On the expulsion oi the Saracens, tbey became a dependency of Sicily. In 1530, Malta 
m given by the Emperor Charles the Fifth, to the knights of St. John of Jerusalem, in 
whose possession it remained till 1798, when it was taken by the French under Bonaparte on 
lus voyage to Egypt. It was captured by the British in 1800, who at tlie peace of Amiens 
^reed to restore it to the knights, but their refusal to do this occasioned a renewal of the war. 
At the treaty of Paris, in 1814, these islands were ceded to Great Britain, and now form one 
of dw most important naval establishments of that power.

\- BoundarUt and Extent. Independent Greece comprises the Mores aud a portion of 
temtoiy nonh of the isthmus, with the islands in the southwest pan of the Archipelago. The 



MS 

OODtinental pan is bounded N, by Turkey, E. by the Archipelago, S. aod W. by the Medilw. 
raneaii or Ionian Sea. The northern boundary being a winding line drawn Grom the Gulf of 
Volo on the E. to the Gulf of Aria on the W. It extends from 36=' 22' to 39Â° 20" N. Iwi. 
tude. The territory, including the islands, contains about 19,000 Bquare mDes. 

3. JHotmtamt. North of the isthmus is Mount Pamatgw or Liakowa, consisting of â–  
ridge running northvest and southeast. Tbe 
name is more strictly applied to one of tht 
eminences near the village of Delphi. ThÂ« 
summit consists of limestone with veins of 
marble containing imbedded sea shells. Il 
is bleak, and almost destitute of herbage ; iB 
height is about 5,700 feet. To tbe s(aA 
east of Parnassus is the ridge of Htlit 
separated from it by the plain of Lin 
Its form is remarkably picturesque i 
graceful. It is lofty and steep, but its gn 
deur is softened to the eye by the Eg'ire aj 
the cliffs and intervening hollows, by H 
woods which siill cover them as ii 
times, and by the beautiful slopes c( 
them with the subjacent plains. The Mar 
MeuM Faraanut. jj^g numerous mountain ridges, the bigbi 

of which is Zeria or Trikala, the tocm 
Cyllene ; it surrounds the famous li 
Btymphale, the scene of one of tbe eiJ 
. ploits of Hercules. In Arcadia are ihei 
mountains of LyctBut and Mtnaltu, upon 
which Apollo mourned tbe loss of Dapb- 
nis. They are covered with nugDiC- 
cent trees, and with oaks of an extraordi- 
nary height. JlfouiU Taygetiu is a lofif 
ridge extending to the south, and temu- 
nating at Cape Matapan, the southern ei- 
tremity of Greece. Another range of 
heights occupy the ancient terriloryof 
Argolis. Jtfount Gtranion runs across 
the isthmus of Corinth. These mouD- 
tainsare every where traversed bynarroir 
defiles impassable to artillery- or cavalry. 
The valleys are immense basins surrounded by tbe mountains, and exhibiting the appearance 
of a great number of distinct craters, each containing a spacious level. 

3. Rivert. The .Aspropotamos, or ancient AcheloWy flows into the Ionian Sea. Tbe Ct- 
pAisnu runs into the Lake of Ltvadia, The Alpheut and Ewotas are the chief rivers of tlie 
Morea. All these are small streams. 

4. Itlandt. ^egroponl, tbe ancient Ettbaa, is a narrow island 100 miles in length, separaied 
from the mainland of Greece by the Euripus, a strait so narrow, thai it is crossed by a draw- 
bridge. The tides in this strait are subject to a remarkable irregularity, which has never been 
explained. The island contains 60,000 inhabitants, and has several good hprbors. It abounds 
Iq corn and vineyards, and maintains numerous flocks of sheep. The honey produced here i) 
delicious, and owes its fine quality to the abundance of roses on tbe island. Marble and asbes- 
tos are found here. J^Ttgropont or Egripo, the capital, stands on the western shore of the island, 
where the bridge connects it with the continent. It is well fortified. Population, 6,000. 

Hydra is tlie most important of the islands, alihoueh one of the smallest. Il lies close lo 
flie eastern coast of the Mona, and is little more than a barren rock. It does not appear to 
have been inhabited in ancient times, but is now the most important naval station in Greece, and 
ha fleets gained many victories over tbe Turks during tbe revolution. The town of Hy^f^f 
stands on the northwestern side of the island, and has a good harbor. Its white bouses rising 
m ranges from tbe water up the side of a rocky hill, make a very picturesque appearance. Th?

occupied exclusively in maridme aifairs. There is do other town on the island. Hydra con- 
niiis 20,000 iDhabiiants. * Spezia, near Hydra, is another rocky island, distinguished by its 
naval war&re mth the Turks. Population, 7,000. Pontbtts 8 good harbor, and a town wiib 
3,600 inhabitants. Tino, Andrat, Scopeloi, Zea, Mieoni, Siphnoi, Seriphot, Syra, JiTaxot^ 
SmnJorini, Egina, Salamis, Parot, Mxlo, are inhabited by a population varying from 3,000 to 
1^000 ; Tino with 22,000, and Syra with 43,000, being the only ones wUch exceed the 
latter number. 
Pant has 3,000 ui}iabitanu, and produces marble, which has been celebrated from all anti- 
quity. â€¢B.ntipaToi, in its neighborhood, is 
celebrated for its grotto, which is one of 
the most remarkable in the world. The 
traveler enters first into a cavern, but af- 
ter advancing a' short distance, frightful 
precipices surround him on every side. 
The only way of descending these steep 
rocks b by means of ropes and ladders 
which have been placed across wide and 
dismal cliffs. Below tbem, at the depth 
of ISOO feet from the surface, is found a 
grotio 360 feet long, 340 wide, and 180 ui 
height, covered with the most beautiful 
stalactites, f This cavern was discovered 
in the 17th century, by Magni, an Italian. 
5. Bays and Gulfo. The Gnlfo/Le- 
panto is a long narrow inlet of the sea, 
GraUa vf AnUparoi. bounding the Morea on the north. The 

Gvif of Egina lies between Attica and 
the Morea and is separated from the Gnlf of Lepanto by the isthmus of Corinth. The gulfs 
or bays of JTapoli, Corony and Colocythia, are also in the Morea. The Gulf of Folo in the 
northeast, and that of tSrta in the northwest, form a part of the boundaries.

Morea, and is also the most southerly point of the European continent. Cape Colanfiay the 
ancient promontory of Sunium, b the southeastern extremity of Attica. 

7. Climate. The climate of Greece resembles that of Spam and Italy, except that the 
extremes both of heat and cold are somewhat greater. In Attica, winter begins in January, 
and snow seldom lies longer than a few days, except upon the mountains. February begms 
with gentle rains, and in this month is the commencement of spring. In the beginiUDg of 
March, the vines and olives bud, the almonds blossom ; the corn reaches a considerable heigh: 
during this month, and is reaped in May. The zephyr, a west wind, is famed for its balmy 
softness. The south and southeast winds are humid. The sirocco is felt in Greece, and is 
attended here with its common effects. The coldest weather is accompanied with a northeast 
wind. The north and northwest winds are severe and dry. The sky is in general cloudless, 
and at the end of summer the fields are parched with excessive heat. 

8. Soil. A great part of the country is rocky and mountainous ; yet the cultivated parts 
have generally an excellent soil. In Attiqa the soil is light. Boeotia, Argos, Messenia, and 
Arcadia are the most fertile districts. Nearly the whole soil rests on a stratum of limestooe. 

9. Vegetation. The most common and remarkable trees and shrubs from Cape Matapan to 
Mount Olympus, are on the plains and hilb ; the olive, the shrubby jasmine {Jasminum fruti- 
cans)y the SQrrax officinale, the strawberry-tree (Arbutus unedo), and ^rbutus Andrachne, the 
myrtle and pomegranate, the cherry laurel, and locust-tree (Cercis siliquastrumjy the pistachio 
(Pistacia lentiscus) and terebinth (P. terebinthus) ^ yielding, the former the celebrated mastich, 
and the latter gum-terebinth, the Cistus creticus, from which is obtained gum laudanum, the 
caper bush (Cappara spinosa) supplying caper of commerce, the sweet-bay or poetical laurel 
(Laurus nobilis)^ the fig (Ficus carica)^ the white and black poplars, aspen, celtis australis, the 
cypress (Cupressus sempervireus) and stone-pine (Pinua ptnea), the juniper and savin, &c., on 
the banks of runnmg waters and m damp spots are found the oriental plane (PkUanus orienta- 
li$)y the white, weeping, and crack willows, alder, the chaste tree (T^tex Agnus castus), and 
the oleander. The mountains produce the Abies taxifolia, the beech, willow, Scotch fir, yew, 
common oak, ash, chestnut, hazel, the flat-leaved lime (Tilia platyphillus)y horse-chestnut 
(Ausculus hippocastanum) y service-tree, mountain-ash, wild apple and pear trees, several oaks, 
&c. The orange and lemon are found within the limits above indicated, but north of the 
Morea only in favorable exposures ; a few date-palms are seen near Athens, and the prickly 
fig does not extend beyond the Morea. The true mistletoe of the ancients {Lorantus europiB- 
us)y of which bird-lime is made maybe seen on the Arcadian oaks, and the banks of the 
Alpheus are covered with a profusion of the narcissus of the poets {Narcissus tazetta). 

10. Minerals. This country formerly contained mines of gold, silver, iron, lead, and cop- 
per, but at present is not productive in minerals. Marble of almost every variety is abundant. 

1 1 . Face of the Country, Half the surface of Greece consfes of mountains. The coun- 
try is in general bare of wood,* and from the want of inclosures, the profusion of weeds and 
bushes, die thinness of the population, and the ruinous condition of the few cottages, combined 
with the crumbling remains of the noble structures of the ancients, has a desolate and melan- 
choly aspect. Yet every feature essential to the beauty of a fine landscape is to be found here. 
The mountains, though not lofty, are imposing from the abruptness of their elevation. At their 
feet lie rich and sheltered plains, or romantic valleys ; these, with spacious bays, islands, and 
seas, broken by headlands, inclosed by mountains and studded with islands in every possible 
variety of magnitude, form and distance, render Greece superior in scenery to almost every 
other part of Europe. 

12. Divisions. The kingdom is divided into 10 districts or nomoi, which are subdivided 
into 47 eparchies.f Population, 800,000. 

13. Towns. Athens^ the capital, about 6 miles from the Gulf of ^gina, is one of the most 
celebrated cities in the world ; long the seat of ancient learning and art, and decorated with innu- 
merable masterpieces of architecture and sculpture, it still retains in its ruins some traces of its 
past splendor ; but it has suffered much during the late war of the revolution, having been sev-

the late war, was about 15,000. In 1845, it had 31,700. 

In the neighborhood are Leptina, the ancient Eleusis j Marathon, a small village, upoo the 

plains of which the Persians were defeil- 

ed by the Atbeneans under Mihiadei,E

are the ruins of llie ancient Tktbtt, 

I once one of the most important cities 

< of Greece. Salona, in Pliocis, situated 

near Parnassus, has some manufacturing 

industry, with from 5,000 to 6,000 inlial)- 

[ itants. In the same neigliborliood, at the 

foot of Parnassus, Is Outri, the ancieni 

Martuion. Delphi which contained the oracle o( 

Apollo, resorted to, in ancient times, 

from all parts of the world. Here is the fountain of Cattalia. Lepanto, Missolonghi, where 

Lord Byron died, in 1824, and AnatolicOf are in Acamania and j^tolia, of which the capital 

is Vrachori. 

The walls and other ruins of the ancieni PlatcEa are still discernible, at the foot of Mount 
Cithsron. In the plain adjoining this town, the Persian army, under Mardonius, was ioiiDy 
defeated by the Athenians and Lacedemonians. 

J^'avplia, or JVapo/t di Romania, the capital of Argolis, is the most important town of the 
Horea, but iu situation is unhealthy. It is the strongest fortress in Greece ; its vast ritedel a 



GREECE. Â«n 

called the Gibraltar of tbe Archipekgo. 
The town is meanly built, and dirty. 
Population, 13,000. In the neighbor- 
hood are the ruins of JiigoÂ», MyunÂ» 
lytnlAiw, and Traztne. The Cyclo- 
pean walla, found in the vicinity of these 
places, conrposed of lai^e blocks of sione, 
are of a remote, but unknown antiquity. 

Tripolilza, capital of Arcadia, was 
the residence of the Turkish auihorilies, 
and the capital of the Morea, previous 
to the revolution ; but its mosques, its 
seraglio, and caslle, have been destroyed, 
and Its population reduced to 2,000 or 
1,500 souls. In the vicinity are the ruins 
p,jâ€ž^ of Tegaa and M^alopolit, ancient capi- 

tals of Arcadia, and of Mantinta, oele- 
braled for the victory gained by Epaminondas over the Spartans. 

Mittra, or MisUrat, the capital of Laconia, was reduced to a heap of ruins by the EgypUan 
forces during the revolution. It is picturesquely situated at the fool of mount Taygetus, and 
its citadel is still standing. The population does not exceed 2,000 Bculs. The rums of Sparta 



are in its vicinity. Monembasia, or J^apoli di Malvasia, important for Its port and its fortifi- 
ritioDs, is noted for its excellent wines, called Malmsey, 

Motion, in tlie nomos of Messenia, is a small town, but has a good harbor, and is strongly 
fortified. Near It is the village of JVuvarino, in whose harbor the Turco-Eeypiian fleet was 
destroyed by the combined Russian, English, and French fleet, in IS27. Calnmata, in iIm 
ume province, has hardly risen from iis ruins, since the desolating campaign of the Egyptians 
in the Morea. Coron-, which is also situated in Messenia, has a good harbor, and is strong^ 
fortified. 

PygM, like Calamata, is be^nntng to recover from its late desolation. Near it are the ruinc

of Olfmpia, in which the Olympic ^ aes were celebrated ; here was the magnificent tem;^ of 
Jupiter CNympus, containing the colossal statue of the god, 60 feet high, made of gold and in> 
ij, by Phidias. Patrat, the capita) of Achala, stands upon the shore of a gulf which beira its 
nme. It is the centre of the commercial relations of the Morea with the rest of Europe, Bad 
contains 8,000 inhabitants. The monastery of MegaspilEeon, in the neighborhood, is celebnted 
for its riches, its fortifications, and vast vauhs ; it contains 300 monks. Calavrila, to tbe 
MUlheast, is a small tonn. 

Corinth, situated upon the iathmus of the same name, between two seas, once ]Â»vrertHil for 



Its wealth and luxury, is now an inconsiderable place, but is rapidly recorering from tbe 
disastors of the war. Its citaael, or Acrocorinth. is a fortress of great strength. In tbe 
neighboring district stand the ruins of tbe ancient Nemtea and Sicyon. 

Syra, on the island of the same name, is the capital of the Cyclades, and the principal 
commercial place in Greece. The commerce of Turkey, Europe, and Egypt, with the whole 
kingdom, centres here ; the almonds of Scio, the wines of Naxos, the grapes of Patras, the 
oil and silk of the Morea, the wool of Romeiia, the rice of Alexandria, &c., are collected in 
its harbor, thronged with vessels. Here also the pirates, that long infested these seas, 
disposed of their ill-got, but rich merchandise. Population, 25,000. 

14. Agriculture. The long oppression which this country has endnred from its Turkic 
masters, and the ravages of the recent war, have almost extinguished agriculture, notwith- 
standing the fertility of the soil. The vine and olive have always been the most important 
articles of cultivation. There are nine species of olives. Excellent wine is made in die 
islands. The raisins of the Morea are much esteemed. Cotton was extensively cultivated 
before the revolution. The sugar-cane and banana are jaised occasionally. Oranges, 
kunons, almonds, and figs, are produced of high excellence. Maize, wheat, and barley are 
the most common grains. The plains of the Morea are well adapted to the culture of maiie, 
KDd readily admit artificial irrigation by canals from the rivers. But a small proportion of 
tbe arable land is occupied, and the tools of the husbandmen are exceedingly rude. 

15. Commerce and Manufactures. The revolution nearly annihilated the commerce of 
Greece, but it has somewhat revived, and the Greek marine now com{>ri8es about 4,000 
Vttsaels. The exports are fruit, oil, wine, dye-woods, gum, nut-galls, and drugs. There big

16. tnhabUaali. The inhabitants of Greece are almost entirely Greeks and Albanians ; 
there are also i few Jews, ArmeDians, Bulgarians, and Wallachians. The Greeks ana tbovt 
die middle size, and retain the distinguished personal beautj of their ancestors. Their eyes are 
large and dark, and their complexions clear. Their faces are of an oval form. They weal 
a moustache on the upper lip, and generally the hair is permitted to grow, except in front 
The wonwa are thought to be inferior in beauty to the men ; but they have a graceful and dig- 
iRfied carriage. There are, at present, no distinctions of classes, though the dragoman or in- 
terpreter at the Porte, and the governors of Moldavia and Wallachia, bad formerly the title 
of princes. 

17. Dress. The dress is showy. The capote is a large woolen garment, with a hood, 
(baggy with short threads of yarn. It is heavy when dry, but nearly insupportable when wet 



U often serves the wandering Greek for both house and bed, and it is a perfect defence against 
cold and dew. The prevaHing dress consists of a short, embroidered jacket, without collar, 
nd with sleeves open from the elbow ; an Nnbroidend vest, a cotton shirt, a tunic of several 

folds, secured by a 
sash or shawl about 
the waist, and reach- 
ing to the knee ; loose 
brogues, or trowsers, 
short socks, and slip- 
pers between sandals 
and shoes. On the 
bead is a red cap, with 
a tassel in the top. 
The girdle or sliawl is 
sometimes very expen- 
sive ; and in one cor- 
ner of this sash, the 
common people gen- 

trtlfy cany tb^ money. The rich cany their money in purses, which, with their bandser- 
chi^, watches, end snufi'-boxes, they put in their bosoms. They afiect to have their vesta 
pufied out, as if distended with money, trinkets, and papers. The above dress, however, is 
not universally worn. The female costume is simjlar to the Turkish ; a vest fitting closely to 
ibe breast, and a gown flowing ofi' loosely behind. The sleeves, which are slit towards thÂ« 
waist, are longer than the arms, and are turned back. A zone circles the body once, loosely 
tMttog on Ibe hip, lied in a spreading knot, or secured with a plate omamrated with jewels.

and matrons heron plumes, or jewels. In many places, the young women dye their bur in 
aubnm color, with the plant called henna. The females when abroad are muffled up in a cloak, 
loid they wear a veil, which is, however, not scrupulously closed. 

18. Language. Tbi modern Greek has so much resemblance to the ancient, that in gene- 
ral a nauve will comprehend what is said to him in the original language, if spoken according 
to the modern pronunciation. There is, however, some difierence of construction. Italian is 
common. - 

19. Jlfaitaer of Bvilding. On this subject the Turks, the Arabs, and the Greeks them- 
selves, have left us little to describe. The villages have been destroyed, and the babltsiioa 
wantonly razed, in the same barbarous spirit that cut down hundreds of thousands of olive ma- 
The houses are of brick, stone, or wood, are whitewashed, and have terraces, but they are 
seldom large. At present, however, many of the poorer class, who have suffered in the desD- 
htion of the country, live in hovels and other temporary shelters. At Napoli and some oihei 
towns, the houses are many of them Turkish, the basements being occupied as stables, which 
are imagined to keep off the plague. The churches are numerous, beyond all parallel in other 
countries ; but many of them are mere oratories open only on a particular holyday. They are 
generally small, and built of stone, without much pretension to elegance. 

20. Food and Drink. The food of the greater number consists principally of bread and 
vegetables, and all use a simple diet. Pilaf, or rice boiled with a little meat or butter, is com- 
mon, and in the pastoral districts yagourU, or milk, coagulated in a particular way by lemon 

i'uice. There is little animal food consumed ; mutton is preferred to beef' In the numerous 
asts, the food is principally olives, garlic, and fish. Wine is not scarce, but it is not used lo 
much extent. Temperance is the national virtue. Tobacco is much used and chiefly in 
smoking. A visiter to a family of wealth, is always ofiered a pipe, water, coffee, and gneel- 
meats. 

21. Diwases. The whole of Greece is subject to pestilential fevers, which lose none oj 
their malignancy by the means adopted for cure. The ignorant seem to think, that sickoess is 
the visitation of a demon, and charms and exorcisms are employed to dislodge him ; and these 
ceremonies are but faintly assisted by jalap, manna, and salts, given in the smallest quantities. 
The physicians are ignorant, except a few who have been educated in the west of Europe- 
There is some leprosy and elephantiasis, which is seldom attempted to he cured. In autumn, 
the people in many places shut themselves up, and will hardly look into the street. Pliguei 
the most terrible of all maladies, is personified in the form of a decrepit hag, that sometinw) 
comes St midnight to the window, and knocks. 

22. Traotling. 'â–  There are few foreigners who travel in Greece, and these generally visit 
the remmns of antiquity. There are no roads in the Morea for carriages, though there are 
some traces of ancient ways. Travelers generally go with mules aod cany their own beis, 



GREECE. 961 

cookioe utensils, and some of their food, for the khans furnish litde but a miserable shelter and 
a board to sleep on. At the best they afford only coffee, native wine, and bread and cheese. 
There are now no robbers in Greece, though before the revolution they were numerous. The 
country is so much impoverished that it costs little to travel in it ; a traveling attendant will en- 
gage at 4 dollars a month, and board himself. Distance is marked by time ; a form borrowed 
from die east, where the caravans are so regular, that it is a correct manner of expression. An 
hour's distance is 3 miles, and when a Greek would say that a place is distant 18 miles,, he de- 
scribes it at 6 hours. There is a strict system of passports, which secures the safety of a 
traveler. A line of stages has been recently established between Napoli and Argos. 

23. Character J Mannersy and Customs, Four centuries of slavery under the hardest, the 
most ignorant, and the most bigoted nation in Europe, every individual of which held almost 
absolute power over a Greek, must have had some unfavorable influence on the national char- 
acter. Yet the national traits of the ancient Greeks are as plain in their descendants as the 
cast of countenance, that has come down to us in medals and statues. There is a great nation- 
al similarity among all the Greeks. The very severity of the Turks, and the contempt m 
which they held the Greeks, had, however, its advantages, for had the conquered *been allowed 
any equality of civil or religious rights, they might long sin^e have been blended by inter- 
marriages, and otherwise, with the conquerors. 

The modern Greeks prove their descent, by possessing some of the virtues and all the faults 
of their ancestors. Slavery is but a bad school for morals, and in it the Greeks have acquired 
hypocrisy, obsequiousness, and such a tendencv towards falsehood, that, generally speaking, 
their assersions are not to be relied upon, unless it b for their mterest to speak the truth. Aris- 
tides, who displeased some of his countrymen in being called the just, would be little envied 
at the present day for such a trait of character. But the situation of the Greeks under the 
Turks was favorable to a profitable trade, though it was not safe for them to appear rich ; this 
and other motives for dissimulation, which the oppressed always have, have left a trace on the 
national character that better institutions will remove. 

The Greeks are vain, passionate, and versatile, but they have proved themselves as brave as 
the bravest of their ancestors. Their enterprise and invincible endurance in the tmequal stn^- 
|e of the revolution, was confined to no class, and the females themselves were worthy of 
iparta. The '^ Sacred Band," composed of 500 young men, the flower of Greece, assumed 
on their banner, " Liberty, Death, or Freedom," and were destroyed on their post by the en- 
emy's cavalry. They bore also on their banner, the charge of the Spartan mother deliverii^ 
a shield to her son, " Either this, or upon this." 

The vanity and ostentation of the Greeks are invincible. At Constantinople it used to be 
accorded to the Princes of the Fanal, to wear yellow slippers, as an honorable distinction, to 
assume which, by a common Greek, was punished with the greatest severiQr. The late Sultan, 
in one of his walks, discovered a Greek in yellow slippers, which he had assumed to gratify a 
momentary feeling of vanity, and caused him to be immediately beheaded ; yet it was not un- 
common to see others running the same risk. A dragoman, against the remonstrances of all his 
friends, would display his wealth in a magnificent house. His riches tempted the cupidity of 
the authorities, and he was beheaded ; yet another of his countrymen immediately occupied the 
same bouse. Another dragoman had the prudence, when he erected a large house, to paint it 
Q 3 divisions, of separate colors, so that to passengers it seemed to be 3 houses, though he oc- 
cupied the whole. 

The Greeks are fond of money, but not from a principle of avarice, for they are ostentatious, 
profuse, and generous. They are kind and indulgent ; and the females are characterized as un- 
commonly amiable in disposition. A great man, or in other words, a rich one, when he meets 
an inferior in the street, omits none of the usual ceremonies of salutation. Both stand with 
their right hands upon their breasts, bowing for several minutes, while they inqunre of each oth- 
er's family and welfare. The manners of the Greeks are exceedingly engaging, though too 
nmch mingled with an air of obsequiousness. They are very attentive to the rights of hospi- 
^ty. In the inland towns a stranger seldom sees the females, who are nearly as much seclu- 
ded as those of Turkey. They occupy a separate part of the house, and are seldom seen but 
by members of the family. After marriage, they have the privilege . of being introduced to 
people of their own rank and to travelers. 

The patriotism of the Greeks is undoubted, though it is not always directed by prudence. 
Their love of country was formerly necessarily connected with hatred to the Turks^ Ml the

fifae ytuog. 

24. J^wemeniB. Cardis are common, and the Greeks are often seen intently engaged wiA 
them at cofiee bouses. Dancing also is much practised, and also the story-teUing so common 
fti the East. Tb^e are, however, do professed i$tory-tellers, but each one m a circle relates 
Â« tale. 

35. Education. The most of the means of instruction have been swept away by the war 
of tbe revolution. There w^e several printing presses. There was a college at Haivali of 
dOO students, and another at Scio of more than 500. The '^ Sacred Band " was composed 
priDcipally of young m^ who returned from foreign universities, chiefly those of GeraiaDy 
and Itriy. â€¢ The female^ teceive but little instruction, and few of them can read. Educa- 
tioD, though at a low ^bb, is receivii^ much aid from foreign sources, and the Greeks them- 
selves are as liberal in its support as their poverty will allow. A university has lately been 
ftNMldeS il Athens, aiid thete is a general desire to send the youth to schools. In languages, 
the youth iNiVe always beeta distinguished for proficiency, and many are familiar with 5 or 6. 
. Th^ are 13 newspapers in liberated Greece, 1 in French, and Â±e others in the language of 
the country. 

Q&. Jlfie and Scienees. The arts are wellnigh extinct in the countij where they wet6 
<taiee the most perfect. The Turks hardly tolerated them, and during their sway, tbe state of 
pK>peltf was loo insecure for the encouragement of the fine arts, or for the collection aad 
preservation of ancient modeb. The music is simple, but monotonous, and it has but Ofie 

fart. The songs are numerous, for the Greeks delight in poetry, and have the facility of tbe 
taKan^ in vel^sificatioli. Their amatory pieces, in which they chiefly delight, though not 
- formed on the tnodel of Sappho, yet, (says Hobhouse,) speak the very language of love, be- 
ing^ceedingly extravagant* 

27. lUl^on. Tbe Greek Church has a great resemblance to tbe Roman Catholic. The 
laws, boi^ever, secure religious toleration. The number of ecclesiastics is very large ; they 
are sup{K>rted chiefly by gifts, and fees for the various sacraments and ceremonies. They are 
not compelled to live in celibacy. They wear their beards, and a peculiar dress. On Mount 
Atbo^ are s^vei^ communities of recluses, called caloyers, amounting to nearly 6,000. Th^y 
cultivate the ground, have vineyards and orchards, and exercise mechanical trades ; mendicant 
brothers from these, as well as from tbe monasteries of Patmos, are to be found tbroughoat 
Greece. Among other absurdities, they administer the extreme unction, by anticipation, to 
whole households. The Virgin Mary is the great object of veneration, imd there is no cottage 
ititbout her picture with a light before it. Statues, which are so prevalent in the Roman 
church, are inadmissible in the Greek, where paintings are universal. The churches are small 
and plain, such as might have been common in the Apostolic times. Men and women sit 
apatt, and have separate entrances. In praying they face to the east, and seldom kneel yV^^ 
ably from original dislike to the Turks, wno are very precise in their posture for prayers. There 
are only 130 days in the year free from fasts, which are strictly kept. The lent at Easter lasts 
2 riionths, and at Christmas 40 days. Wednesdays and Fridays arc fasts throughout the yoar ; 
the ft^mer day, because on that day Judas received the money for his treachery. Much of 
the joyful part of religious festivals is retained. 

The weddings are celebrated with rejoicings, and a procession attends the bride to her ftrtore 
horai3. In the procession are often many young girls, dressed in white, preceded by music, 
and who. scatter flowers m the path. The funerals are attended with show. The body is 
richly dressed and strewed with flowers. A long procession is formed, and two or three dM 
women hired hft the occasion walk by the side of the bier, howling, and askhig of the dead 
Btch Â«[uestions as these, " Why did you die ? you had money, friends, a fair wife, and nrany 
children. Why did you die ?" On the 9th day after, a feast is given by the nearest relative, 
accompanied with music and dancing. The cemeteries are not in churches, but generally oear 
t teWÂ»| OD ihe highway. They are shaded with cypress or yew.

20. ^atiqvUiet. In ancient Greece, art embellished what nature bad made beantUU. 
Greece and tbe islands are in the most favored climate, and in tbe temples the richest naarUea 
retain their beauty, while tbe sculptures have preserved for ages their most delicate carving. 
The surface of the statues is nowas smooth as when they ceme from the hands of the sculptor. 
No country was ever adorned like ancient Greece, and none ran be again. She has leU bo 
monument that is not now a model in literature and art. The elegance, simplicity, an^ 
grandeur of ber temples, standing frequently upon some hill or headland to which tney seened 
appendages, attracted the eye of the mariner at a distance from the shore. Wherever a Greek 
west, in his own country or colonies, he beheld among architecture and sculpture, objects that 
refined his mind, and gave new aliment to its natural taste for the beautiful. A temple was tbaa 
more than any temple is now. The friese, and other parts that would permit sculptures, were 
peopled with figures, that, mutilated as they now are, are the best preservative and sdiofd 
of art. 

The antiquities of Greece are chiefly architecture and sculptia-e. Yet all but the very tem- 
ples have been exported to different parts of the world. Tbe best, even of tbe temples, dw 
Fartbeooa itself, bas been dilapidated and pillaged by a British Ambassador, and her beet onw- 
tnents are now in England. Vases, statues, &c., are often found in excavations, at tbe ancient 
cities, and it ii probable, that hereafter many of great excellence may be recovered, and font 
a national museum for Greece. 

In the Peloponnesus, whose ruins we shall first describe, the traveler cannot go far without 
iatling among toe remains of greatness. The most of them are so broken, that scarcely a peF- 
fect column now exists, but otlms ere in such a state of preservation, (hat, at a distance, tbey 
. seem entire. At Basse is tbe temple of Apollo Epicurius. The frieze representing the 



Ridnr iff Andaa Corinlk. 

w|rB of the Centaurs and Lapilbte, and of the Greeks and Amazons, has been carried to EogT 
land. The temple is 135 feet long with a fi-ont of 48 feet. There arc 13 columns in tba 
side, and 6 in the front. It b one of the most impressive cenuuos of tbe ancieat Greeks. At 



9M 6BEECS* 

NeflMM, are three Doric columns of a toiiq)le of Jupiter ; the breadth of this edifice was H 
feet) ami the length more than douUe the breadth. The columns are more than 5 feet in diam* 
eter, and nearly 32 feet high. At Mycens the gate of the sun is the earliest authenticated, 
sculpture in Europe. A cu-cular wall of large blocks incloses an area of 62 feet diameter, 
and in this are the two gates. The architraves are fallen^ but one b unbroken, and leans upon 
the wall, from the ground. It is 19 feet long. 

The subterranean edifice covered with a mound of earth, and called the Treasury of Atreus, 
has been supposed also to be the tomb of Agamemnon. * The form is that of a bee-hive. 
The interior shows many brass nails, which were probably used to secure metal or marble 
{dates. The dome is 50 feet high, and 47 i in diameter ; over the entrance is an enormous 
stone, 27 feet by 17. At Jero are many ruins, and a cistern in good preservation, 40 feet in 
length and more than 100 in breadth. There ib the vestige of a great temple to ^sculapius, 
with inscriptions on some loose marbles of some of his cures. There are good sculptured 
marbles, and the theatre is the most perfect in Greece. The proscenium only is gone. The 
orchestra is 89 feet in diameter, and there are 55 rows of seats remaining. Pausanias de- 
scribes this theatre as the most beautiful he had ever seen. 

The walls of TIrinthus, a sort of fortification on a hill, are nearly perfect, though erected 
1379 years before Christ. They are nearly 25 feet m thickness. At Sparta, Argos, and 
Corinth there are few distinct ruins. Near the latter is an amphitheatre, cut in the rock, and* at 
Sparta are the remains of a large theatre, which has some marks of Roman architecture or re- 
pairs. But the ruins of Sparta are hardly to be traced. At Corinth are 7 columns, supporting 
their architraves, of the Doric order. They are pf stone. They are heavy and inelegant, and 
of great antiquity. (Sec cut on page 699.) 

The islands have many ruins. At Caularia are the remains of the Temple of Neptunej 
where Demosthenes expired, and his monument remained in the precincts of the temple, in 
the second century. At ^gina is the Temple of Jupiter Panhelleneus, one of the most an- 
cient and remarkable ruins of Greece. The .inhabitants of JSgina, in a very remote age, at- 
tributed it to iSacus. There are 23 Doric colunins standing on a mountain, and rising among 
trees. In several other islands are theatres, in good preservation, and dilapidated temples. 
Continental Greece, however, has the most perfect and interesting remains. Delphi has many 
mouldering ruins, but none in such preservation as to show how ancient art delighted to adorn 
that seat of the muses. The Castdian spring, issuing from a rock is received into a large 
square basin, with steps to it cut in the rock. There are niches cut also in the face and sides' 
of the precipice. The present Delphians season their casks in the fountain, by which, ssnrs a 
traveler, they seem to preserve the ancient connexion between Bacchus and Apollo. There 
is no vestige of the Temple of Apollo, nor can its site be identified. The theatre has disa^ 
peared, but therer*are some traces of the stadium and gymnasium. The prophetic cavern is 
sought for in vain. The brazen pillar, that supported the tripod, is at Constantinople. 

Athens, however, is the only place in Greece in which the traveler may, on a distant view, 
suppose, that he is not in a country of ruins. The distant view of the Acropolis and its tern- 

1)les, is, in general effect, what it was in the days of Pericles ; but with the distance the de- 
usion vanishes. The vicinity is seen strewed with ruins, among which are standing columns, 
and in the town, ancient marbles are found in the pavements and walls of houses. The first vis- 
it of a stranger is to the Acropolis, or citadel, as at Rome it is to the Forum. The top of the 
hill is surrounded by walls. The space is about 800 feet long and 400 broad ; a noble espla- 
nade for the magnificent structure that crowns it. The color of these monuments is of a golden 
tint, like autumnal foliage. The Parthenon, or Temple of Minerva^ the great fountain of art, 
whose form and proportions are so often copied in Europe and America, is on the most elevat- 
ed ground. It is an oblong parallelogram, with a vestibule and portico. The columns of these 
rest immediately on the steps of the temple, of which there are three. They are without bases, 
fluted, of the Doric order, 42 feet in height and at the bottom 17 J in diameter. The whole 
structure was 218 feet in length and 98i in breadth. The portico or pronaos occupies about 
one thbd of the length of the edifice. The frieze of the vestibule was decorated with triglipb 
of the Doric order, and between these were metopes, or tablets of marble, sculptured by Phi- 
dias or his pupils, with the battle of the Centaurs and Lapitbs. The top of the wall of the 
temple was decorated with other long basso relievos. Lord Elgin, the British envoy at Cot- 
stantinople, caused the best of the sculptures to be taken down and removed. Within the 
walls are also included the relics of the Propytea, and the ruins of the Temple of Victory. 
Behind the former, towards thexity, is the Pandrosieum, and the double Temple of NeptuM

tad Uioem. The Temple of Theseus, in a large space on tbe plun, is in b^ter presetratioo 



iban tbe Partbenon, wbicb it somewhat resembles, though it is more like the temples at Pestum ; 
with tiie exception of the sculptures it is almost entire. The Areopagus was on an eminence

hill and tbat of the Poyx from the hill of the citadel. The Vajx is an espluiade, vben Urn 
Atbeoians first held their assemblies ; a rostrum, with an ascent of four steps, is cut ia (be 
rock ; and here Pericles, Demosthenes, and Socrates harangued the Athenians. The bill 
of the museum is crowned with the tomb of Philopappus, an obscure person of the i^e of 
Trajan. 

Ihe Temple of Minerva, at Sunium, is of the Doric order, and the materials ue of (be 
whitest marble ; it is one of the most finished specimens of attic 8rchi(eGture. Fifteen coluauis 
are yet standing ; and though the marble nearest the sea is somewhat decomposed, yet such ij 
the mildness of the climate, that the pencil marks made by travelers on the columns yearsago, 
are as distinct as when first written. The Temple of the Winds is an octi^onal edKce, of u 
tmposiog character, with figures sculptured in relief upon the sides. The monuments that are 
called Hadrian's Pillars, are, from their situauoo and magnitude, to be seen from almost every 
quarter. They are sixteen colunins of white marble, of the Corinthian order and of exquisite 
woriimanship ; each is six feet in diameter, and nearly six feet h^. These are someiimn 
desciibed as the remains of the temple of Jupiter Olympus. 

30. Siitory. Greece is the most celebrated country of all antiquity, and the land from 

which the arts of civilization were 
diffused over Europe. In i(s eai- 
' liest ages it comprised many small 
' political divisions) independent of 
each oUier, but uniting to avert any 
! common danger, or accomplish any 
purpose of general interest, as efiDc- 
ed in the Trojan war, and the strug- 
gles against the invading Persians. 
At a later period Alexander carried 
Grecian arms to the Indus and ibe 
language became prevalen( in Syria 
and Egypt by means of his cooquesl. 
The whole country was conquered 
by the Romans and formed a portion 
of their great empire II conliDued 
under the dominion of tlie Greek 
yoKiv AUiandtr emperors till the establishment of ihe 

Ottoman power in Europe, when it 
became a province of Turkey ; and for four centuries lay under the grinding oppression of its 
Mahometan conquerors. 

In 1831 the Greeks rose in insurrection and declared (heir independence. A long and Hoodj 
conflict ensued, in which (hey received indirect 
aid from many parts of Europe, end from the 
United States, alihough no government offer- 
ed them any open encouragement. After ibe 
country had been thoroughly devastated, and 
abundant scenes of bloodshed, rapine, and des- 
olation had evinced the deterrainalion of the 
Greeks not to submit, the governments of Hus- 
sia, France, and England thought fit to inter- 
fere from motives of humanity. The negotia- 
tions for this purpose would, perhaps, have 
resulted in nothing, but for a fortunate blunder 
of Ihe British admiral, who, not understanding 
the niceties of the matter upon his hands, at- 

^^ their marine at a single blow. This event es 

Ubhshed the independence of the Greeks. The Turks were unable to make head against ibeir 
revolted subjects from this moment, and the allied governments finding themselves fairly com- 
mitted in the business, persisted till the Sultan was brought to tenns. By the proioco oj 
March, 1829, Greece was left to its own government, with a tribute of a million and a hall " 
piamon tc be paid anniMlly fo (he Pone. 



XUfiOPBAS TOBEBT. 
CHAPTER XXI, EUROPEAN TURKEY 



PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHV. 

1. Bomdaritt and Extent. European Turker is bounded N. by tbe Austnao and Russian 
territories ; E. by the Black Sea, the Sea of Marmora, and the Archipelago ; S. by Inde- 

Eident Greece ; and W. by the Adriatic. The continental part extends from 39Â° to 48Â° N. 
tude, and from 16Â° to 30Â° E. longitude. It comprises 210,000 square miles. 
2- Mountains. ' The Carpathian Movniains form a part of the northwestern frontier ; hut 
the first great mountain barrier of Turkey, on tbe north,' is the chain called the Balkan, or 
Emiiuh Dag, anciently called Mount Hkhius. It extends from the western limit of Turkey 
to the Black Sea, and its numerous branchtts intersect the whole of tbe territory south of the 
Diauhe. Tbe loftiest point is Mount Orbelus, 9,660 feet in height. The defiles of these 
tBOuntains are nearly impassable during winter. The summits generally consist of masses of 
Hiked granite, but in some parts they are covered with thick forests. The Hellenic Movntttin* 

constitute a range extending from the 
Balkan, southerly and southeasterly, into 
Greece, and terminating at the promon- 
tory of Sunium, In Attica. This range 
divides the northern part of ancient 
Greece into two portions of nearly equal 
breadth. Pindus, CithiEron, and Par- 
nassus were the ancient names applied 
to different branches of this range. Tbe 
celebrated J^ovnt Olj/mptis, which the 
ancients considered the loftiest summit 
in the world, is near the western shore 
of the Gulf of Salonica, and is between 
6,000 and 7,000 feet high. Its base 
and sides are covered with thick woods 
of oak, chestnut, beech, and plane trees, 
JVvmu OlympuM. and the higher parts with pines. There 

were many other mountains called Olym- 
pus, in different parts of Greece. Further east, a second branch leaves the main chain of the 
Balkan, ftnd traverses Bulgaria and Humelia, terminatmg on the Archipelago and Sea of Mar- 
mora, in numerous spurs. It is called Mount Rodope, or Despoto Dag, and reaches an eleva- 
tion of about 6,500 feet. Mount .AlhoB is an insulated hill, on a promontory of the Archipelago, 
f>ui it has principally attracted notice for its conical shape, and for the numerous churches and 
monasteries, that adorn tbe picturesque declivities near its summit. 

3. Rivera. The basin of the Danube includes more than a third part of Turkey in Europe. 
It receives numerous streams, the principal of which are the Pruth and the StrttK. The JIftiri*- 
U, which was the Helma of ancient geographers, rises in the mountama of Htcmus, and enters 



268 EUROPEAN TURKEY. 

the Archipelago, after a course of nearly 250 miles. The Jllbanian Drino discharges itself into 
the basin of the Adriatic ; and the southern branch of that river, or the Black Drtno, receives 
the waters of the lake Ochrida. The Axius^ or Fardar of the modems, flows through a space 
of about 200 miles, into the Gulf of Salonica. JlchelouSy now the â€¢AspropotamoSy rises in the 
mountains of Pindus, and, flowing towards the south, enters the Ionian Sea. The PeneWj has 
its source near that of the Achelous, and, traversing the plain of Thessaly, pursues its course to 
the Archipelago. Before entering the sea, it passes the gorge or defile of Temper where the 
precipitous mountain clifls of Ossa and Olympus approach each other so close, that the inter* 
vening space does not exceed 200 and sometimes 100 feet. The length of the vale is about 3 
miles, and its greatest breadth. 2|. 

4. Lakes, Turkey contains several lakes, but those in the southern part are rather of clas- 
sical fame than of geographical importance. In the northern regions, they are either too small 
or too imperfectly known to demand description. Several occur near the mouth of the Danube, 
formed by the overflowing of that river, but they are destitute of picturesque beauty. 

6. Isiands. In the Archipelago are the small isknds of Thassos^ Samothracej ImbroSy and 
a few others, which may be considered as a part of European Turkey. None of them are of 
any political importance. 

6. Seas and Gulfs, The ^gean Sea, or Grecian Archipelago, is remarkable for the nu- 
merous peninsulas which project into its waters from the neighboring continent, and form manj 
bays and gulfs, and for the innumerable isles which ^^ scattered throughout its whole extent, 
and which impede the navigation. The Hellespont^ or Strait of the Dardanelles^ connects the 
.Â£gean Sea with the Sea of Marmora ; the mouth of the strait is 5^ miles wide, and is defend- 
ed by castles, built in 1659. The Sea of Marmora^ so called from its blue marble, is about 
140 miles long, and in some places 50 broad. The Thracian Bosphorusy or Straits of Con" 
stantinophy the Euxine or Black Sea, the Ionian and the Adriatic seas, wash different parts 
of the coast. The Gulf of Salonica makes a deep opening into ancient Macedonia. 

7. Climate and Soil. The climate is superior to that of almost every other European re- 

E*on, being uniformly salubrious and delightful. The infectious diseases which prevail in tbe 
rger cities, are rather attributable to the negligence and habits of the Turks, than to the ud- 
'healthiness of the atmosphere ; the soil is extremely fertile, and capable of yielding all the vege- 
table productions of the south in rich and varied profusion. Many of the valleys are composed 
of fine alluvial earth, the deposite of successive ages. 

8. Vegetable Productions. Besides herbs and plants of almost every kind, this country pro- 
duces, in great perfection, oranges, lemons, citrons, pomegranates, grapes, figs, almonds, olives, 
and other fruits. In addition to these, many drugs, not common in other parts of Europe, are 
produced here. Lofty forests of oak, ash, elm, &c. grow on the side of the mountains, whose 
summits are crowned with larches, firs, and yews. 

9. Animals. The horses of Turkey have long been esteemed for their size, form, and 
spirit, but the camel is the most common beast of burden. Cattle and sheep are numerous in 
many districts, and the sheep of Wallachia are noted for their fine form and beautiful spiral 
horns. Jackals are found in some of the deserted tracts near the Bosphorus. The forests are 
well stocked with deer, wild boars, chamois, and hares ; there are besides a great many bears, 
wolves, foxes, and martens, of which the skins are exported to different parts of Europe. 

10. Minerals. Mines of iron, lead, and copper, are found in several parts, but are neglected 
through the ignorance and indolence of the people. In Macedonia were anciently gold mines, 
which annually produced to Philip nearly 13,000,000 dollars. Alum and sulphur, perfectly 
pure, are met with ; and quarries of beautiful marble are abundant. 

1 1 . Face of the Country, Many districts are covered with rich pastures or extensive for- 
ests, but the general character of the country is mountainous. Long ranges intersect it in vari- 
ous directions, and their lateral branches, with several detached hills and groups, extend over 
many of the other districts. The northern provinces are the most level, and the southern the 
most hilly and diversified. 

POLITICAL GEOGRAPHY. 

1. Divisions. The country is often described by geographers under the divisions BulganSi 
Bosnia, Albania, Romelia, Macedonia, and Livadia. But by the Turks, it is divided into 4 
eyalets or principalities, which are subdivided into sangiacs or banners. Theeyalets are, !â€¢ 6^ 



EDBOPEAN TUBKEY. 269 

bo'u, comOTisiog Bulgaria ; 2. RomeUa or Rum'eli, comprising Romelia, Macedonia, and Al- 
India; 3. Bosnia ; and 4. Dshazair, composed chiefly of the islands and Asiatic possessions. 
Beside these divisions, are the 3 tributary prmcipalities of Moldavia, Wallacbia, and Servia, 
which are rather appendages to the empire than integral parts of it. Servia has now a beredi- 
tttj prince, with its own laws, and an independent administration, but pays an annual tribute, 
ud is obliged to receive a Turkish garrison in certain posts. Moldavia and Wallacbia are gov- 
erned by DOSfKM^s appointed by the Sultan, and pav an annual tribute, but no Turkish troops 
ire allowed to enter their limits. The populauon of these principalities is 3,700,000. 

3. Tomu. Constantinople, the metropolis of this extensive empire, is situated at the con* 
fluence of the Bosphorus with the Sea of Marmora, and stands on the site of the ancient By- 
aatium. Conslantlne, sensible of the immense advantages of its position, fixed bis residence 
here, in 330, id preference to Rome. The 7 hills on which it is built, ascend as ihey recede 
from the shore, and a beautiful green hill forms the back-ground. An arm of the Bosphorus 
affords it an excellent harbor, with an open navigation to the Black Sea on the north, and the 
Hedilerranean on the south. The whole circuit of the city is about 13 miles. A wall from 
14 to 30 feet high, flanked with towers, and having 6 gates, r\ins along the side next the sea, 
while the ancient wall incloses the land side. The external appearfmce of Constantinople is 
magnificent. Palaces, mosques, seraglios, 
baths, bazars, domes, turrets, and spires, 
tower one above another. But the magic of 
the prospect disappears on entering the city. 
Here is seen nothing but narrow, crooked, 
dirty streets, and houses of wood, of brick, 
and of mud, covered with cement. The num- 
ber of mosques has been stated at more than 
340, most of which are built of marble, and 
covered with lead. The grand mosque of St. 
Sophia is the most renowned of the public 
buildings ; it was formerly a Greek church, 
dedicated to the Holy Wisdom, or Sancu 
Sophia, and was built by the emperor Justi- 
nian. Its length is 370 feet, and its .breadth 
S40. The cupola, which is lined with mosaic 
work, rests on pillars of marble. Many of the 
other mosques of more recent erection, though 
of less magnitude, are handsome, and display 
considerable taste. 

The Seraglio of the Sultan is one of the 
Motqma </ Sl ftrnth, peculiarities of Constantinople. It includes 

the harem, or apartment of the women, the 
buildings inhabited by the Sultan and his court, and the public offices, which are separated from 
the city by' a vast wall, and entered by several gates, two of which are of magnificent archilec 
â– ure. It presents a confused assemblage of objects, houses, domes, trees, and pavilions. Con- 
nected with many of the mosques are madrasses or schools for the higher branches of education ; 
iwirftj or hospitals for the sick ; places for the preparation and distribulion of food for tlie 
poai ; courts, with fountains for ablution, &c. There are also numerous monasteries for the 
denisbes, sophis, and other monastic orders of Mahometans. The public places ore called 
^Mdaiu or {Hains ; the most remarkable of these is the Atmeidan, or ancient hippodrome, in 
wbich the young Turks perform equestrian exercises. The baths, of which there are above 
^ ; dw*khans or war^ouses of the mercbauta ; the caravanseries, in which are lodged the 
iivlers belonging to the caravans, &c., are also worthy of note. The principal suburbs are the 
Tophaoa, or cannon-foundery, containing the arsenal ; Galaia, the residence of the Christian 
''KrcbaDts ; and Pera, which contained the hous^ of the European diplomatic agents, until its 
destruction by fire, in 1831. The Fanar is a quarter of the city inhabited by the old and 
"falihy Greek families, hence called Fanariota. Population of the city, about 900,000. Scu- 
tui OD the Asiatic aide bas 60,000. The strait or Bosphorus is thronged with light calks or 
^'oni, and is remarkable for the picturesque beauty of its shores, covered with smding villagetf

pahees^Idosks, and groves ; among the Tillages, Buyukdere^ in which tbe'Â£ujr6peim ambissi- 
dors pass die summer, and Belgradcy are the most remarkable. 

Mrianopk^ which was long the residence of the sultans, and is considered the second oipi- 
tal of the empire, is situated upon a small stream, near its confluence with the Maritza. The 
mosque of Selim, the immense dome of which is supported by pillars of porphyry ; the ba2ar, 
with its gaUery a quarter of a mile in lengdi, and the ancient palace of the sultans, a magBificeoc 
edifice, are its principal buildings. It has a flourishing trade and extensive noanuiactures, with 
140,000 inhabitants. 

The other principal towns of Rumelia are PhUippopoU^ with 40,000 inhabitants, who cany 
on a brisk trade and manufactures of silk, woolen, and cotton ; GallipoU^ a large commercid 
city, upon the Strait of the Dardanelles, with 40,000 inhabitants ; and Selimniay near tbe Bal- 
kan, noted for its fairs, its rose-water, and its manufacture of arms, with 20,000 inbabitantg. 
The fortresses of Sestos and Abydos^ the latter in Asia, upon tbe HeUespont, have acquired 
celebrity in poetry. 

Sahnica, in the southern part of Macedonia, upon a gulf of the same name, is the second 
city of European Turkey in commercial importance. It also has extensive manufactures of 
cotton, silks, carpets, morocco, &c. It contains a great number of mosques, whose domes and 
minarets give it a fine appearance from the sea. The Jews and Greeks are numerous here. 
Population, 70,000. To the southeast of Salonica is Mount Athos^ called by the modem 
Greeks tbe Holy Mount, celebrated for its 22 convents, its 500 chapels and grottoes, inhabited 
'by above 4,000 monks ; they export wax, images of saints, &c. Serts^ with 80,000 iDbabi- 
tants, is situated in an unhealthy spot, and is chiefly remarkable for its cÂ«tton trade. 

Larissa^ with 30,000 inhabitants, is the most important town of Livadia. Its manufactures 
of cotton, silk, morocco, and tobacco, and its extensive dye-works, contribute to render its 
commerce flourishing. In the neighborhood are the Mtteora^ or heights, a series of monas- 
teries hewn out of the precipitous rocks, to which the only access is by means of baskets drawn 
up by ropes. Sophia^ a large but meanly built city, has 46,000 inhabitants. 

Shumla^ one of the strongest fortresses in Europe, has important manufactures of copper, 
leather, silk, and iron. SilUtria, upon the Danube, with 20,000 inhabitants ; Rustshuky 30,000, 
an important manufacturing and commercial town ; Varna, upon the Black sea, remarkable for 
its fortifications and fine harbor, with 16,000 inhabitants ; Widin^ also a strong fortress, and a 
commercial town, with 25,000 inhabitant ; Jficopoliy 10,000, and Sistova^ with 21,000, are 
the chief places in Bulgaria. 

Fantna, capital of Albania, previous to tbe recent wars in that district, bad a population of 
40,000 souls. But the rebellion of Ali Pacha in 1822, involved this city in ruin. Suli^ cap- 
ital of a rugged region of Albania, is chiefly remarkable for the heroic resistance of its inhab- 
itants, the Suliots, to the attacks of Ali. â€¢Arta, 9,000 inhabiunts, upon tbe gulf of tbe same 
name, and Prev$$a^ 8,000, upon the same gulf, are important commercial towns. ScvUvri^ 
upon the lake of the same name, contains 20,000 inhabitants, who are engaged in tbe fisheries, 
ship-building, and the manufacturing of arms, and woolen and cotton goods. It is strongly for- 
tified, and is one of the principal fortresses on tlie western frontier. 

Cettina is remarkable as the chief place of the district inhabited by tbe Montenegrins, a 
warlike tribe of mountaineers, who have maintained their mdependence of the Turks. BoitM' 
flfcroi, in Bosnia, is a large citv with strong military works, numerous mosques and baths, and 
an imperial palace. Its manufactures of arms, hardware, woolep and cotton goods, and leath- 
er, are important, and it is the centre of a brisk transit trade. Population, 70,000. 

Bucharest^ the capital of Wallachia, is a large and dirty town, situated in a marshy plain, on 
a confluent of the Danube. The streets, like those of Jassy, are not paved, but covered with 
planks. It contains 60 churches, several convents, &c., and has a population of 80,000. 
Tergovist^ formerly a large city and the residence of the hospodar, is now on the decline, and 
has but 5,000 inhabitants. Braihw^ on the Danube, formerly remarkable for its fortifications, 
which have been demolished, and Crajova^ a place of considerable trade, with 8,000 inhabit 
ants, are the other towns of Wallachia. ^ ^ 

The ancient capital of Servia was Semendria, now a small town with about 12,000 inhabit- 
ants, situated on the Danube. Belgrade^ the principal city of Servia, is one of the strongest 
fortresses of Europe, and is held by a Turkish garrison. It has manufactures of silk, cotton, 
leather, carpets, and arms, and considerable trade. Population, 30,000. 

/ofay, an urregularly and meanly built town, with 27,000 inhabitants, is the capital of Molda- 



SUBOPBAN TOBitlBT^ 371 



fii. It was ahnost destrwed by the Jaoissaries'm 1821, and it suffered much i^ain from 

conflagrations of 1827. Its trade is active, but is carried on chiefly by Greeks and'Armau- 
ans, and the meohanic arts are chiefly exercised by Germans. 

3. ^SgricuUurB. Notwithstanding the fertility of the soil, agriculture is little known and leas 
practised. In the northern provinces the pasture is luxuriant, and wheat might be raised in al- 
most any quantity. In the southern parts rice is common. Barley and a kind of grain called 
durra^ are likewise cultivated. Excellent grapes are produced, with abundance of dates and 
olives. 

4. Commerce. No country possesses greater commercial advantages than European Tur- 
key ; but they are neglected through the despotism of the government and the inactivity of the 
people. The internal trade is almost entirely in the hands of Greeks and foreigners. The 
principal exports are carpets, cotton, wool, silk, tobacco, currants, raisins, wine, hides, wax, 
&c. The imports are chiefly cloths, coffee, sugar, spices, glass, hardware, jewelry, paper, 
and slaves from Georgia and the Caucasus. 

5. Man%\facture3. Few articles are made in suflicient quantities to supply the home con- 
sumpdon, and scarcely any for exportation, except carpets^ Silks are m^ufactured in several 
places, but not to any great extent. 

6. Inhabitants. The Turks themselves do not form the chief part of the population of the 
Empire. The great mass of mhabitants are Greeks, Armenians, Wallachians, Jews, Al- 
banians, Gypsies, &c. The Turks are perhaps, with regard to form and feature, the finest race 
of men in Europe. Their life is one of ease ; their dress is loose and flowing, and without 
the ligatures so common in the west of Europe ; their ablutions are frequent, and their women 
have for ages been selected for beauty from the Greeks, Circassians, and Georgians ; with all 
these circumstances it would be strange if the Turks were not a handsome race. The Turks 
are well formed and have high foreheads, dark eyes, and finely cut features. Their complex- 
ion is dark ; nearly a copper color. They have much gravity of demeanor, and are seldom 
seen to move quickly^ except on horseback. 

The distinctions of rank are those of office. There is no hereditary nobility except the 
Emirs or descendants of Mahomet, through his daughter Fatimah. They are scattered over 
the empire, and have such a character for simplicity, that the Turks say of a simpleton, '^ he is 
of the Emu-s.'* This deterioration of intellect in the Emirs b perhaps occasioned by intermar- 
rying only m their own lineage. They wear Mahomet's color, green, which it is not lawful for 
odiers to wear, and Christians are never suffered to assume it. The daughter of a foreign 
consul was shot by a. Mussulman, while she was inadvertently riding in a green dress, and the 
nuirderer was not tliought to be a fanatic. A blow to an Emir is punished by cutting off the 
hand. 

7. Dress, The dress of the Turks is not liable to sudden change ; it is hardly liable to in- 

novation. It is, however, considerably different 
from the prints in books of travels in Turkey a hun^ 
dred years ago. On the head is a turban, or a cap 
surrounded by many folds of cloth. The form and 
size are various, and denote the rank of the wearer. 
The Turks abominate hats, and the populace nail 
them to the doors of those whom they stigmatize as 
traitors. The Turks never uncover their heads, and 
the ambassadors wear their hats before the Sultan. 
The head is shaven close, except a single long tuft 
left on the crown, by which the devout Moslemin 
supposes he will be lifted into paradise. The Ar- 
menians, Jews, and Greeks are distinguished by the 
TW^. colors of their hats and slippers, and it is not per- 

mitted them to wear any but the stated color. 
The Turkish dress is loose and flowing ; the outward garment is a long and loose robe. Un* 
<lenieath is a wide vest bound with a sash ; loose drawers, and a shirt with wide sleeves, with- 
out wristbands. On the feet are worn slippers, which on entering a house are left at the door. 
This is the usual dress, though many classes have a different one. An office is often denoted 
^ the dress. There are sumptuary laws regulating dress ; which is, however, still very rich 
*PÂ«cially on the great religious festivals. The present Sultan has reduced the dress somewhat 




S72 EUBOPEAN TDBKET. 

towards the European standad. The Eroirs, or descendants of the prophet, dress in green. 
The dress of the females has a general resemblance to that of the men ; though when the head 
is covered, a stiff cap j^ worn instead of a turban. When abroad the women are so cloself 
â–¼eiled, that their nearest friends cannot recognise them ; and the veil perhaps encourages in- 
trigue as much as it defends modesty. The hair is worn long ; it is plaited in embroidered 
gauze about the head, and then falls in tresses to the waist. It is fastened there with many 
little knobs of gold. The females are always in full dress, and their hair loaded with ornaments 
and sparkling with diamonds. The eyelids are tinged with a dark substance, which adds to 
the effect of the long eyelashes by relieving the brilliancy of the eye. 

8. Languages. The Turkish is a dialect of the language of most of the Noroade tnbes. 
Its rules are simple, and it has flexibility and harmony. It is written in the Arabic character 
There are about 30,000 works in this language, chiefly commentaries on the Koran. Besides 
this, there are the Italian, Greek, Armenian, Sclavonic, and other languages, extensively useH 
in Turkey. The Italian, however, is the language of commerce, though so much nHxed ^ith 
foreign words, that it is rather the lif^gua franca. In Wallachia, once a Roman province, there 
has been so little convnunication with foreigners, that the language remains perhaps as inQch like 
the Latin as it was under the Romans. It was probably never,^ in its most refined state, the lan- 
guage of the Augustan age at Rome.* 

9. Manner of Building^^ The Turkish cities have all a splendid appearance, when seen at 
a distance, but the delusion vanishes when they are entered. There are many towers, domes, 
and minarets, and these seen over the line of walls always make an imposing show. But the in- 
dividual houses have neither elegance nor comfort ; and many of them are slightly built, of 
perishable materials. The more substantial kind have verandas and courts, and on the flat 
roofs the inhabitants sleep in certain seasons. A fire rages in a Turkish, city. The general 
apathy of the people, the want of concert or organization, and their creed of predestination, 
are so many allies to the flame, which is seldom checked at Constantinople till it lacks fuel by 
reaching an open place, or till a space is cleared by the removal of houses. This is not diffi- 
cult, as the buildings are small. The houses have little exterior ornament, for in Turkey it Js 
not safe to make a display of wealth. The interior is finished with much finery but little taste. 
The rooms have carpets, and there is a divan, or raised step, or platform, running round them, 
which is covered with cushions, that make the only seats of the Turks, on which they sit cross- 
legged like tailors. Sometimes several cushions are piled together and form a sort of raised 
couch. There are no tables, but trays are used, which are placed upon the floor. There are 
no fire-places, and though it is not rare, that persons are killed by the vapor of charcoal, the 
rooms are warmed by nothing else. 

Architecture is an art founded on necessity, and where this is neglected, the ornamental arts 
can have no encouragement. Yet perhaps any other people than the Turks would in Turkey 
have produced some monuments of good architecture. Asia Minor and Syria have more nu- 
merous and imposing remains of ancient art, than are to be found in Europe. The Turk views 
them with his usual apathy ; and so much above his estimation- of human means do they seem, 
that he refers their erection to the agency of spirits, summoned by Solomon ; yet he feels no 
admiration and attempts no imitation. 

10. Food and Drink, The Turks ar^ temperate in their food, of which rice forms the 
principal share. Sometimes it is boiled with mutton, or fowl, when it is called pihtc. The 
fowl is boiled so much, that the master of the house easily separates the joints with his fingers, 
which is his mode of carving. Curds, cheese, youart, and other preparations of milk are 
common, but there is no butter. Many courses are often brought in at meals, one after the 
other. Each person has 2 spoons and a flat cake of bread, and all help themselves from the 
common dish. This has ever been the eastern custom, and the Saviour indicated his be- 
trayer as the one that dipped his hand with him in the dish. Coffee is universal throughout the 
East, in an Arab tent as well as the castle of a Pashaw. It is a strong, turbid decoction, 
drank without sugar or milk. It is handed to every visiter whom the host would treat with com' 
mon civility. Among the Arabs and other tribes, that adopt their custonos, it is the behest 
pledge of confidence to- eat together. It is seldom violated, either for interest or revenge, the

strongest motives of a larbarian. Trarel- 
ers, vho put themselves under an Arab 
guide, first partake of food with him, bÂ»- 
lore ihey trust him in the desert. 

Wine, which was interdicted hj MÂ«- 
bomel, is now freely drank, except bj the 
most fanatic and austere, and its use is be^ 
coming more general still. After diilneri 
ladies often take several small passes of 
rosoglio, a distilled cordial. The pipe, 
however, affords the chief pleasure, or ratln 
er employment, to a Turk. Tbe use of it is 
universal and almost uninterrupted. On 
horseback, riding, sitting, walking, reclin- 
ing, or laboring at his art, it is a constant 
companion. It is one of tbe few things 
on which the Turks display much splen- 
dor or taste. It is always sumptuous, 
with those who can aSbrd it. The tube 
is 6 or 7 feet in length, and tbe bow] is 
richly ornamented. The bowl is some- 
times supported on wheels, that, in moving 
n^iAWÂ»mmnaUÂ»fBriuL it, tbe mdolencc of tbe smoker may not 

be violated. 

In a life as void of incident as that of a 
Turk, some there are who seek the ex- 
citement of opium. There are coffee- 
houses for these Theriakis, or opium-eat- 
ers, where they may be seen sitting on 
benches before tbe door, absorbed in their 
celestial visions. The composition used 
at Constantinople to produce tbe excite- 
ment, is made of the pistils of the hemp 
blossom, honey, powdered cloves, nutmeg, 
and saffron. The dose varies from 3 grains 
to a drachm, and the effect lasts 4 or 6 
hours. Tbe gestures of men under the 
operalion of the drug are frightful, and 
their eyes have an unnatural wildness and 
brilliancy. The Theriakis seldom live be- 
yond 30, if they begin lo use the drug 
young, and tbeir moral and physical de- 
bility is deplorable. They are not, how- 
SiOtrtaf rtgttaiU*. ever, very numerous. 

11. Distases. Fevers are common in 
(Ik greater pari of Turkey, and in Wallacbia, goitres and other alpine diseases. Leprosy w 
often found, and opthalmia is frequent. It is the plague, however, that is tbe bane of the cities. - 
This terrible destroyer has generally baffled all human skill, both in its natural climates, and in 
others to which it has been imported. It is contagious, and it has been supposed also to be 
lafectious. The Turkish mode of life seems devised, especially to perpetuate tbe plogue, the 
virulence of which is much a^avated by putrefying animal and vegetable substances. Tbe 
sireets have no scavengers ; they are receptacles of filth, and whatever animal dies, is left to 
iiint the air, in a burning climate. The science of meoicioe is unknown in Turkey, and a be- 
lief in pred est! nation, with tbe general indifference of the Turks to all things but ease, suffi- 
UDDtly account for the unchecked ravages of the pbgue. Tbe disease commonly runs its 
coturse in 3 days, and the patient may have his system thoroughly invaded before he is sensible 
of the presence of tbe disease ; generally, however, tbe glands are sore, and there are buboes 
, M the groin. When these break and are kept open, tbe patient recovers ; if they remain

^nrd, ihe disease strikes upon the inward parts, and he dies. The general custom has been to 
)pedace the inflaromatloD 07 bleeding and otberwbe ; but Dr. Madden has lately been emi- 
lieptly successful in the opposite course. He supposed, that nature should be assisted in the 
formation of the sores, and gave large quantities of brandy, even in extreme cases, with the 
jtreatest success. With this treatment 75 in 100 recovered. 

12. Traveling. In European Turkey, posts are established, but the horses are very infe- 
rior, and they are to be had only oq the chief routes. It is a service of difficulty, endurance, 
and danger to reach Constantinople by land from Vienna. In leaving Austria, the traveler's 
^dships and perils are increased ; and his journey is always amone &ose who have little re- 
spect for his life or property. There are but two reasons that lead Europeans to travel m this 
country, curiosity or gain. But the gratifications to the former are so numerous, that many 
adventurers have explored the parts where the danger and privation are greatest. Foreigners, 
who do not travel in parties, generally go i#der the direction of a guide or attendant on horse- 
back. The roads are passable for rud^ carriages. The only accommodation that may be 
generally relied upon is shelter, though this is not always to be had. There are, however, 
pins, or caravanserais, at which ma^ be had a shelter like that of a stable, with a provision of 
chopped straw for the horses. It is seldom that they are furnished with food. It b well for 
the European traveler to supply himself with a Janissary cloak, a thick garment of goat's or 
c^r^ePs hair, and, if he is in baste, to put himself mider the care of one of the Tartar couriers, 
who are familiar with the route. It will conduce somewhat to his comfort, also, to assume a dress 
of the coqntry ; and the greater the poverty it indicates, the less is the danger from robbers, 
or the vexation from extortioners. There is danger from robbers m many of the less settled 
parts of Turkey, and there is extortion everywhere. It is to be lamented, that countries, 
which it would otherwise be so agreeable to visit, and that have many mteresting antiquities, 
^uld be so difficult to explore. Most of these dangers have, mdeed, disappeared of kte 
^ears ; still, there is little comfort or pleasure in traveling here. 

13. Character^ Mannersy and Customs. In describing national character, it is of the Turb 
only, that it is safe to speak in very precise terms. The character of a whole people is sel- 
dom so uniform, that it raav be described in a few words ; yet almost all travelers in Turkey 
concur in describing the Turks as ignorant, fanatic, arrogant, and sanguinary ; treacherous to 
^neinies, and perfidious to friends. The ignorance of a Turk is more than negative ; it is pos- 
itive hostility to knowledge. Those who know more languages than one, often conceal the 
knowledge, to avoid the disgrace attached to it. These, however, are few, andÂ» until the 
Greek Revolution, none but Greeks were found capable of performing the duties of dragoman, 
or diplomatic interpreter. With this passion for ignorance, it is not strange, that the Turks are 
as little enlightened as they were before they " encamped " in Europe.* Wherever the Turks 
have authority, commerce and manufactures have few followers ; art and science languish, the 
venr earth seems to be blasted, and agriculture itself has hardly an existence. The arrogance 
i|nd fanaticism of the Turks are at least equal to their ignorance. Their creed inculcates no 
toleration for infidels, and it prefers extermination to conversion. The best epithet bestowed 
lipon a Christian, is dog ; and it is sometimes changed for other terms of reproach. A Janis- 
sary attendant upon foreigners, used to be called a hog-driver ; and when a European ambassa- 
dor communicated to the grand vizier the marriage of the imperial family that he represented, 
he received for answer the gracious assurance, that the Sublime Porte did not concern itself in 
the union of one hog with another. Madden, who had lately the best opportunities for esti- 
mating the Turks, fortifies our description in almost every particular. He says, that he never

the pilot on board, being out of sight of land, knew noth- 
ing of her situation, he sent the chart, with a respectful 
*ciDessage to the captain, teUing him the ship's latitude, and 
'Jier probable distance from Rhodes, Finica Baj, Cyprus, 
^4fcc. Upon this, he was summoned, with the Ragusan, 
i^to the fabin, %nd immediateljr asked, how he could pre-

passed ihrough a baiir, where the men did not set the dogs upon him, the boys pelt him witk 
stones, the women spit upon him, and all curse him and call him eaffrt. 

No people have such indifference to shedding blood ; the streets of Constantinople show 
many dead ^odies, and others are often seen floating in the Bosphorus. At the massacre of 
the Janissaries, when 20,000 were enclosed in their quarters and killed, and when the report 
of the cannon shook the air at Pera, it was as auiet there as if the firbg was only to celebrate 
a victory. No man was disturbed, or omitted bis usual business. A late traveler with some 
friends, came, unawares, across a road, over which a company of artillery were exercising at a 
target. They were seen by the Turks, but the firing was continued, and the balls passed near 
to the travelers. A Turk regards the life of a dog more than that of a man. This is from 
respect to Quithmer, the dog of the seven sleepers, whom they believe slipped into Paradise, 
where he now presides over letters missive, and a Mussulman writes Quithmer on the comer 
of his letter, alter cutting a piece from it, to show the imperfection of all human works. The 
Turics are generally armed, and this, in a country where passion is checked by so few restraints 
of law, leads to many murders. Any person of a difierent creed holds hb life on the ibrbear - 
mce of a Turk. 

The perfidy of the Turks is manifested in their public, as well as private relations. An 
officer, whose death is determined upon, is sent to his government, with every demonstradon of 
&vor, but an executioner is despatched with a party, to kiU him on the way, or on his arrival. 
Sometimes the executioner goes alone, and when, after a long course of dissimulation, he is at 
kst admitted to the presence of his suspicious victim, he stabs him in the divan, and tskes from 
bis bosom the Sultan's firman or order, to shield him from the vengeance of the attendants. 
Sometimes, however, the wary ofiicer searches all suspected visiters, and, on finding the 
order, sends back to the Sultan his messenger's head. Several of these messengers have been 
leot to the Pacha of Egypt, but none have ever returned. Dr. Madden saw, in the course 
of his short practice, many cases of poisoning ; a most formidable number, if taken as a pro^ 
portion to the whole people, and the best proof of general perfiiy and treachery. . 

It is evident, that all national character is the result of circumstances, but chiefly of civil and 
religious institutions ; and to judge from the result, these are nowhere worse than in Turicey. 
But in describing the Turks by their faults, it should not be forgotten, that they have one ba- 
tiooal virtue truly singular. Byron's description of an individual has a wider application. 
"One vurtue, and a thousand crimes," viras not a personal peculiarirjr of the corsair ; it is 
dmost a national trait, for the Turks are distinguished for honesty. Their words are security 
IS good as bonds in other countries. Children are sent to make purchases at shops and are sel* 
dom wronged ; the shops are secured in the master's absence with a string. It has been said, 
however, that the honesty of the Turks is not the offspring of justice, a principle for which they 
have no reverence in the other relations of life. A late traveler supposes it to be a consequence 
of the contempt in which the Greeks were held, who were so fraudulent in their dealings, that 
the Turks would take an opposite course from spite, and form a character for honesty on the 
tMmdation of a bad motive. This, however, is to consider it too curiously ; and the Turks 
should be allowed the full credit of national honesty in their commercial dealings, though repa- 
ss and unjust in their political and official. 

The gravity of the Turks is m some degree a consequence of indolence ; and late traveleni 
represent them as cheerful in their private circle ; Dr. Madden often heard peals of laugh* 
t^ at night from the women's apartments. A Turkish house is a castle of indolence, images 
rfrest, of ** quiet and of sleep profound," invade the mind at the threshold. The murmur 
of fountains soothes the ear, some simple and monotonous tune is sounded for hours to compose, 
the master, the pipe is never from his hand, and he is seldom so happy as when all these means 
have phced him in a state of reverie, in which, without being asleep, he can yet live without the 
labor of thought, careless of the future, and forgetful of the present and the past. In all thfe 
boQsehold arrangements and decorations, the gratification of the senses is more studied than 
drnt of the imagination. There are no pictures, statues, or incitements to thought ; everything 
leads to repose. â€¢ 

The Turks are said to be encamped in Europe, to show the insecurity of the tenure by 
which they hold their conquest, and their reluctance to follow any European customs. The 
^vher pushes the razor from him in shaving, the carpenter draws the saw towards him, and sks

the houses are finished first at the top. The upper story is often inhabited, while there is, of 
(he lower, nothing but the frame. 

The polygamy and other mdulgences permitted by the Koran, tend to the utter debasemeDt 
of the Â¥ufks. They are attended with various circumstances, which mark a very peculiar and 
degraded state of society. For instance, the Kislar Aga, or chief of the black eunuchs, b an 
important officer, not only of the household, but of the state. He is by nature ferocious, for 
ugliness and ferocity are the best recommendations to his office. Mutes, or the deaf and dumb, 
are sought for by. Pachas, as acceptable presents to the Sultan ; there are 40 of these servasts 
at the seraglio, who can see, but not tell ; suffisr, and not complain. Dwarfs and deformed 
persons are also attached to the court, as in various eastern countries. Caliph Vathek is repre- 
sented to have been met and welcomed on a visit in the East by a ^' superb corps of cripples." 
It sometimes forms the amusement of the great to vex these poor beinss. If a mute has the 
good fortune to be at the same time, deformed, and a eunuch, his welfare is established ; and 
be becomes a favorite with those whose favor is fortune. The Kislar Aga is often a formida- 
ble enemy to the grand vizier ; he heads the plots of the seraglio, and naturally undermines the 
credit of the vizier, that he may himself receive more bribes from applicants for offices, or par* 
dons ; his situation gives him great power to serve his friends or punish his enemies. 

The seclusion of the harems or women's apartments is never invaded ; the great have eunuchs, 
but the other classes trust to the security of locks, and the custom of seclusion. The harems 
are generally fitted up with some attempts at splendor, for the poorest Turk seems to have some 
hidden means of supply ; living at a rate of expenditure far beyond bis ostensible income. The 
overplus is made up by extortion upon the industrious classes, the Jews, Armenians, Greeks, 
and Franks. 

Madden, in his capacity of physician, had an opportunity to visit the market for female 
slaves ; a deplorable consequence of the state of society in Turkey. This is a horrid slavery, to 
which all other is as freedom. The young and the beautiful Greeks, Circassians, and others, 
are sold to the highest bidder, and their beauty becomes the measure of their value. A Ne- 
gress seUs for about 80 dollars, an Abyssinian, for 150, and a Greek or Georgian, for 300, or 
more. 

14. JimuBemenis. The Turks are too grave and indolent to have many amusements. Games 
of chance are forbidden in the Koran, but chess is common. The jereed, or exercise oo 
horseback with lances, is pursued with great adroitness and skill. Hoi^emen scour the plain 
and throw the lance while riding at full speed, and catch it from the ground without cbeckiog 
the horse. The lances are thrown with great precision, and the mastery of the rider over his 
horse is perfect ; both seem to have but one will. The manner in which the Turks wrestle is 
to grasp the waist, while one strives to lift the other from the ground and throw him on his 
back ; a feat often accomjpanied by broken bones. 

The baths form the chief amusement, especially of the females, for whom separate ones are 
provided ; or the common baths are devoted to them on particular days, when none of the other 
sex approach. The females go with a slave or two, and pass many hours in each other's so- 
ciety. The baths are here what the operas are in western Europe. Bathing is the luxury of 
a warm climate, but, after the Turkish fashion, it is of no easy endurance to a novice. The 
bather undresses in an outwai*d room, and enters an inner one with an atmosphere of steam ; 
he can hardly draw his breath, till a profuse perspiration comes to his relief. He seats himself 
on a slippery board, at the side of a fountain, while an attendant rubs him with a glove of horse 
hair. This process b so severe; that the skin of a new beeinner, or foreigner, sometimes fol- 
lows the glove. After this comes the shampooning, in which the body is turned over as thouj^ 
it were dead, the joints cracked, and the whole surface thumped and kneaded. The bath is 
exceedingly refreshing ; it renders the joints supple, and removes all obstruction from the 
pores. 

15. Education. To read the Koran is the principal end of education in Turkey, and evea 
to do this is by no means universal. All religion, morals, and law, are supposed to be found 
in the Koran ; and all education begins and ends with this. To be able to repeat many chap- 
ters is to have a character both for piety and learning. A Turkish female, that can read, is 
hardly to be found ; and is considered a miracle of knowledge. A newspaper b pinted ai 
Constantinople, under the direction of the Sultan, but there are few books of any kind in the 
hnguage, that contain useful knowledge. The Turkish books are chiefly commentaries on the 
Koran. 



JBUBOPEAN TUBKSX. 179 

â€¢ l(. 8taU of the Art$y Science, and LUerature. The Turks have no taste for the oroameiH 
ttl arts, and have attained to no excellence in the useful ones ; their manufacture of sworcis ii 
the only one in which they have equaled the other nations of Europe. The religious creed 

troscribes the imitative arts ; and the Turks must, moreover, lack all taste for them, or it would 
are be^n excited by the remains of antiquity in Greece, Constantinople, and Asia Minor. 
But every Turk is an Attila. The arts, then, may be said to be unknown in Turkey ; or their 
highest efforts are to ornament a pipe, or the trappings of a horse, in which, if in anything, a 
Turk is sumotuous. The Turks have done nothing for science ; though vaccination came to 
the rest of Europe from Turkey. But it was accident, to which it owed its origin, and not to 
science. There are about 30,000 volumes of Turkish books, which are. chiefly conunentaries 
on the Koran, with some poetry and tales. 

The physicians in Turkey rely as much upon charms as upon medicines. When neither 
charms nor medicines avail, the friends collect round the dying man, assure him of the blissful 
reward that awaits him as a believer, and intimate to him, that it is proper to enter paradise with 
a cheerful countenance. A Frank physician, however, has the greatest credit mm the Turks, 
and diere are many of them settled m the cities. They visit even the haremsy forbidden to all 
others, though the pulse is often submitted to them covered with gauze. Dr. Madden, who 
has given an excellent account of the Turks, had, as a physician, frequent opportunities to see 
them in theur domesuc circle. Before he could expect to be much employed, however, he 
foUowed the custom of the country, in huring an attendant, a sort of mountebank, to go with 
him to the coffee-houses, eulogize bis skill, and recount his cures, in no measured language. In 
&ct, the more surprising and incredible the cure related, the more readily was it believed. 
There is no other way than this for a Frank physician to be called to practice in Constantino- 
ple. The pulse only is offered to the physician ; and from this alone, the Turks expect that 
ne will know the whole nature o^the disease ; their backwardness in giving any other informa* 
tion, often endangers their lives. 

17. Religion. The religion is chiefly the Mahometan, the Qhristian, and the Jewish. The 
Christian is divided into the Armenian, the Catholic, and the Greek churches. Toleratioq, 
however, is no part of the Mahometan religion, which prevails not only in Turkey in Europe, 
but in a vast portion of Asia and Africa. It is so much blended with various points of Chris- 
tianity and Judaism, that it has sometimes been called a Christian heresy. The founder, Ma- 
homet, whom his followers call the Prophet, was bom at Mecca, A. D. 569, and it is held by 
his believers, that he was foretold by Christ, as the paraclytCy or Renowned ; and that the word 
paraclete^ or Comforter, is a perversion of the text. Li his youth, he was employed as a 
traveling merchant and as a soldier. His fortunes and influence were established by a marriage 
with Cadijah, a rich widow. By her he had eight children, one of whom only survived him, 
his daughter Fatimah, from whom the Emirs claim a descent. During the life of Cadijah, he 
bad no other wife. It was not until the age of 40, that Mahomet pretended to be commissioned 
to reveal a new religion. At first, he had the fate of better prophets, the incredulity of his 
countrymen ; and his very wife treated him for a time as a dreamer. By degrees, however, a 
few influential men became his followers, and it was soon after extensively believed, that the 
Angel Gabriel was the messenger who communicated the detached parts of the Koraii ; for 
dus pretended oracle was produced at different times, and to suit various occasions. Mf hornet 
bad thus, a ready way to silence all cavilers, and even to rebuke the love of finery in his wives. 
A new revelation, touchmg the individual case, was always at hand, and the mandate of to-day 
night be modified or repealed by that of to-morrow. 

After the death of Cadijah, the wives of Mahomet became numerous and somewhat trouble- 
tome to guide. They were from 15 to 21 in number, for so far the various authorities agree ; 
Ae best beloved of these, Ayesha, was suspected of infidelity, but acquitted by a ready chapter 
of the Koran. The prophet finding his affections turned towards the wife of Zeid, one of his 
best servants and earliest converts, found an immediate resource in another chapter, and she 
became his wife. Another of his wives was a Jewess, who complained that her lineage was 
contemned by her companions, and to her he said, " Canst thou not boast Aaron is my father, 
Moses is my uncle, and Mahomet is my husband ! " He usurped a posthumous authority, and, 
^h a spirit of mean jealousy, interdicted his wives from marrying after his death. He or- 
damed in the Koran, that visiters should not look upon his wives ; but rather speak to them be- 
bind a curtain ; and he affirmed, 'Mhat it would be a grievous thing in the sight of God,'^ for 
iay one to " marry his wives after him forever." 



CUJKWBAM ItllUUfif. 



TmB Konui was indeed a readjr conreBieoce to Mehomet. If a vWter stqM too loogi dÂ» 
toiiuMiiity was better advised m a chapter. ^' O, true believer^'' says the Korao^ ^ emer not 
loto the bouses of the prophet, without waiting his convenient time ; but when ye art invitod, 
then enter. And when ye shall have eaten, disperse yourselves, mid stay not to enter iato 
foniliar discourse, for this incomroodeth the prophet. He b ashamed to Ud you de[Hfft, fattt 
Ood is not ashamed of the truth." 

Persecution followed partial success, and Mahomet was obliged to retire from Mecca. This 
flight, called in the Arabic tcMigue Hejira, has become the grand era of all Mahometan oatiODs. 
It answers to the year A. D. 622. At Medina, the fi^tive became a monarch, and found in 
army at his command. His doctrines varied with his fortunes, and, with force at his command^ 
his religion was now to be extended by violence, though hitherto he had employed only f9h 
Suasion. But he was now a legislator, judge, prophet, priest, and military chief. All the 
chapters of the Kdhn were devised under peculiar circumstances, and for certain ends. The 
most of these that w^e made at Medina, where the impostor had jpower to aid his fraud, ira 
intolerant and sanguinary. This spirit has generally animated his fdiowers, and their principle 
's, ^ the Koran, death, or tribute." Renegades, however, are distrusted and despised. 

The wars that followed, were attended with various success ; but, in the end, consolidated the 
power of Mahomet. He died in his 63d year, of the effects of poison, which had been con- 
cealed in a shoulder of mutton. On this occasion, some of his tanatic followers believe in i 
miracle, or that the mutton spoke to warn him. The Mahometans, however, do not geoenXtf 
believe in any miracles, but the great standing one of the Koran ; and on this, Mahomet Um- 
self, when questioned as to his miraculous commission, chiefly relied. The chief doctrines of 
die Koran are contained in the confession of &ith, ^^ There is no God but God, and Mahonet 
is his prophet." The unity of the Supreme was the more insisted on, that the creed might the 
more differ from the trinity of the Chnstians. Providence and pred^tination, universal disso* 
lution, and the death of even Azrael, the angel of death, a resurrection, judgment, the interces- 
eion of Mahomet, purgatory, hell, and paradise, are parts of the Mahometan creed. Paradise 
is painted with the profusion of all that delights the oriental in this life ; with gardens, palaces, 
fbunfdns, and houries^ or beautiful females, whose only study is to reward the pious belie?er. 
It is indeed but a bad creed, that would crown a life of intolerance and violence withÂ«a martyr's 
death, and a sensual paradise.* It is a vulgar error, that Mahomet taught the exclusioa of 
the souls of females from paradise. The reverse is held in the Koran, nor is the exclusion 
believed in Turkey. The Koran corresponds with the Old Testament in the account of the 
creation, the fall, the deluge, the deliverance of Noah, the call o( Abraham, the histories of 
Isaac, Ishmael, Jacob, and the patriarchs, the selection of the Jews as a chosen people, the 
office and miracles of Moses, the inspiration of the prophets and psalmists, and in many other 
particulars. It recognises Christ as the Messiah of tne Jews, but all these truths are mixed 
up with fables and puerilities. 

The principal commandments of the hw are to pray five times a day, to fast at Ramazan, to 
give alms, to make a pilgrimage to Mecca, and to perform ablutions. The minor requisitions 
are circumcision, abstinence from swine's flesh, or the flesh of any animal strangled. There 
are two sects, the folk)wers of Ali, and the followers of Omar, as lieutenant of the prophet. 
The Persians are of the sect ot Ali. There are divers religious orders, of which the princi- 
pal are 32. There are a great many mendicants and itinerant dervises, who have many mooo*

liiMJik trfoks, wMcb tbejr pnictiser ttdrohlf . The Turks hfn^e a great respect for all dAsg^ 
eonaected with Mahomet, aad tfaeSr reverence for the Koran is extreme. Ther w^ pidt 
Iff a piece of paper b die street, to see if it be not a fragment of the Kortm. The sacred 
Cttid, that leads the pilgrimage to Mecca, is a descendant of Mahomet's eamel^ ahd Hm 
great standard of the empire, seldom unftirled, and a sight of which is considered eqoal to t 
pilgrimage, is no less a thmg than the prophet's breeches. 

The Koran prescribes the attitudes of prayer, and the time which the Muezziki calls &(M 
the minaret of the mosque, for there are no beQs. '^ Ccmie to prayer," cries he b the moriM 
flig, ^* there is no God bat God. Come to prayers ; prayer b better than sleiep.'^ At now 
he adds, ^^ prayer is better than food." The Mussulnrans, when they pray, turn* tows^ 
Mecca ; and they are much absorbed m their prayers, praying with great fervor and awe. Th^ 
lasts are strictly kept, and in that of Ranaazan, it is not lawAd to taste so much lis a drop of 
water during the day, from one new moon to another. During this last, it is no time to soKcif 
a fiivor from Ae devout. After the fast, comes Ae feast of ^irain, which is carried to grei^ 
excess. The mosques are generally supported by bequests of money rive n for religious pur^ 
poses, and this is one of the few safe dispositions of it in Turkey. Wells, fountains, inn^^ 
bospiteds, &c. are founded in the same way. The Turks are strict in r^dering alms, whicli 
are annually about 2| per cent on their property. 

Marriages in Turkey are mere contracts, made olneAy by the parents and friends of th^ 
poties. Two children are betrothed at a tender age, sometimes at 3 cÂ« 4^ and whe^ the ^n^ 
gagement is completed, art mature years, the bride is carried in a procession to the husbatid^t 
house. Divorces are had almost at the will of the husband ; for, though he have no cause^ fa^ 
tan find witnesses at every coffee-house ; as no crime is more l^equent^ or more lighdy ptUi* 
ished in Turkey, than perjury. The wife's portion is retained by bersdf, after divorce. 
The usual allowance, called in this country piii-money, is known in Turkey as slipper-money. 
After divorce, however, it is not permitted to the parties to come together again, tilt the wife 
had lived with another man. Courtship is much curtailed in Turkey. The sexes^ never meet 
m society, and to sabte a lady in the street, is the height of rudeness. Politeness prescribes, 
Ihflft a genftleman should look the other way. A flower dropped lit a lady's path, is an intimikh 
iKm of affection ; and the female pedler, or other emissary, may carry the swain in return, ah 
tabroidered handkerchief ; but there is no correspondence, no bUletS'-daux but those of 
flowers. Flowers have an amatory and poetical meaning, sufficient to express the usual senti- 
iseato of love and hope, suspense and favor. It is not, however, because it is poetical, that 
dkis language of flowers is iti Turkey that of love, for to Turkish ladies a written billet wodd 
ke an unfathomable mystery ; to read and write is no part of their education ; poetry anli 
Axnance they have none except in feeling. 

<' No bustling Botteibyt have they, to tfaovr 'em

The Turks bury their dead tiaked, and place them with dieur faces towards MeccaÂ» The 
tutying grounds are shaded with cypress trees, and neatly kept ; it is common to see female^ 
A tbem placing flowers around the graves. A turban, rudely carved on a stone, is placed 
o^er the grave of a male, and a vase over that of a female. On the tombs of unmarrilkl 
fetkudes, instead of the vase is a rose. 

18. Ootremm^nf. The form of government is a pure, unmixed despotism, and there k^' 
nothing to stay the authority of the Sultan but public opinion, a feeble interposition in Turkey. 
The monarchy is hereditary, though the sultans are sometimes deposed. They ate not 
crowned, but girded with the sword of Mahomet ; and it is to their capacity of successors la 
the prophet, that they owe the most of their power. It is considered martyrdom to die by tb* 
Sultan's command, and utterly disgraceful to fly from the mandate of death. On such occa- 
8H)Ds a subject's very wives have often turned against him. The sultans have ever had in a 
peal degree the Turkish prodigality of life ; it is an established principle in public opinion, that 
tney may take fourteen hves daily. The males, who are by collateral birth near the throne, 
4re either murdered or imprisoned. The sultana valide, or mother of the Sultan, has gene- 
taBy much influence in the state. The Sultan is called by his subjects, in the wajr of rebuke, 
4e " son of a slave " ; and his education gives him a slave's vices, before he attains :o a mas- 
tcPa power. His palace is", at the same time, a prison and a shambles ; rad no place m this 
upper world has been stained with more violence and injustice than the seraglio ; there is al- 
ways some plot here to supplant a favorite, and the denouenunt of every plol is Uood ; for in

As the observances of despotism are kept up in the seraglio, all is prostration and fear ; and 
even those who feel no awe, pretend it by confusion and hesitation of speech, when addressing 
the monarch. All attendants walk quickly, as a slow gait is appropriated to majesty. Tbe 
(ate Sultan was one of the few monarchs, who ever ruled the Turks, that was bent upon im- 
proving them, and he has done something, though much remains to be done. 

Some of the Sultan's tides are, ^^ Son of Mahomet, King above all Kings, Seed of the 
(3reat Alexander, Lord of the Tree of Life and of the River Fliskey, Prior of the EartUj 
Paradise, Commander of all things that are to be commanded. Centre of Victory, Shadow (h 
God." The court is called the Sublime Porte, and all decrees or treaties are dated ^^ from our 
stirrup." The Divan, or Council of State, is composed of the Ministers of the Interior, Â£x- 
tenor, and Finance. The government of the provinces is delegated to pachas, waivodes, and 
Other officers. The military ensigns are horsetails, and the dignity of the pachas is measured 
)ff the number they are permitted to assume, three being the most honorable. All offices are 
sold ; the incumbents give to the treasury a certain sum, and indemnify themselves by extortii^ 
from the subjects placed under them. The pachas divide their territories into districts^ and 
dispose of them as they have bought their pachalics ; so that the circle of extortion is com* 

eete. There b no security for property, and the last para is often rendered up under the 
istinado. T-o serve the state, is a principle unknown among Turkish officers ; to serve 
themselves, with little choice of means, is the practice. They indemnify themselves for their 
Qxpense and brief authority, by all the wealth that their rapacity can collect. They live upon 
a oangerous post ; and history has recorded that 33 viziers have been executed at the com* 
mand of their masters. The inferior officers are too numerous to be recorded. 

19. Laws. The Turkish laws are contained principally in the Koran and the commentaries 
of sages. They are not generally unjust, but the administration of them is utterly corrupt,* 
and the judge decides in favor of the party which propitiates him by the greatest bribe. In oth- 
er countries, it is common to retain the lawyer ; m Turkey it is more necessary to retain tbe 
judge. Everything is venal ; the complamt of the informer, the testimony of the vritness, and 
the sentence of the judge. Property is safe only when it is concealed. The edicts of the 
Sultan have the force of laws, and it is safe for him to outrage all things but custom, the only 
protection of those who live under a despotism. To custom the Sultan must himself submit ; 
ttid it would cost him his crown to invade generally the private apartments of his subjects. 
He has the property of all those who die in his service, a tax of 10 per cent upon all inherited 
property, and as many confiscations as he is pleased to make executions. Some of the laws or 
rather municipal regulations are, that nothing shall be charged for the novelty or fashion of an 
article, and tnat even the early fruit shall be sold as low as the late. A baker, who defrauds in 
the quantity of bread, is nailed to his door by the ears for 24 hours ; a law which, says a recent 
traveler, if introduced into all civilized countries would raise the price of nails. A bole is cut 
in the door for his head, and both ears are nailed to the board. The bastinado is the common 
punishment for the lighter crimes ; it is inflicted by hard blows on the soles of the feet, or by 
beating with a cudgel, the ribs, stomach, and loins. The bastinado is the common method or 
oqllectii^ the taxes in provinces. Petty lurceny is punished in the same way, but this is io

Turfcqr^ as ia Spabi a rare ofiSBoce. The Tud^, lika the Spiiuard, lue tbo mucb pride, erea 
in bis dishooesty, to commit so mean an offence. The common punishment for perjury, the 
ffeat promoter of all crimes, is only to ride backwards on an ass. The punishment of deoiil 
k inflicted in various ways. Sometimes the criminal or the victim, is strangled by a rope called 
the bow-string, twisted with a stick at the back of the neck. Impaling is rare, but decapitatioD 
by the cioieter Ls common. The bodies are thrown for three days mto the street, and are c^ 
ten devoured by do^s. For adultery it is at Constantinople the piactice, after a brief eonstd- 
tation with the cadi, to tie the female in a sack, and drown her in the Bosphorus. It is noty 
however, very common. All the operations of the judicial authorities are prompt and summa- 
JT, aad if the guilt;^ are punished, it is little heeded, that the innocent may suffer* At PÂ«raÂ» 
toe Franks complained, tnat many robberies had been committed by the porters, and several 
were io consequence strangled. The evil continued, and the porters were employed in a body 
to carry grain on board the Capudan Pacha's ship, where all were seized, and drowned. 

The ulemas are men learned in the laws, and include ministers of religion, doctc^ in law> 
called muftis ; and judges, called cadis. The grand mufti resides in the capital and his person 
is sacred ; the Sultan cannot condemn to death any inferior mufti, till he has first invested him 
with some other office. The mufti expounds the law and gives a written decision, even to a 
feigoed case, called ^^/etva." There are 55 volumes of these decisions, of which the followifig 
are samples. ^^ Can the son-in-law legally marry his mother-in-law ? He cannot. God knows 
oest. Can women and children of property be assessed ? Yes. God knows best." 

20. ArUiquitiei. The Turks are no conservators of antiquities ; and the best remains of tbo 
conquered people have disappeared. The walls of Constantinople are still nearly perfect ; and 
in several places they are inscribed with the names of the emperors. The mosque, which was the 
church of Sancta Sophia, is preserved only because the conquerors converted it to the uses of 
their own worship. In the Hippodrome, which is about 400 feet long by 100 wide, is a pyraroidy 
a needle of Egyptian granite, and the column of two twisted serpents, that supported the tripod at 
Delphi. The heads of the serpents have been broken off. Several cisterns show the magnifi- 
cence of the ancient city. Some are filled up with sand, and used as gardens, and some, that 
are still covered, are turned to other uses. One, called the Strangers' Friend, is a vast subter* 
raneous edifice, supported by marble pillars. It is of great depth, and has 672 marble columns, 
each column being composed of three pillars. It holds 1,237,939 cubic feet. It will supply 
the whole city widi water for 60 davs. Another cistern is like a subterranean lake, and extends 
under severd streets. The roof is arched and supported by 336 magnificent pillars. This 
only is put to its original use, yet its existence is not generally known to the citizens. A num- 
ber of tubes ascend to supply the streets above, yet so incurious are the Turks, that the peo 
pie who use the water know not whence it comes. The Aqueduct of Valens, stretching from 
hiD to hill, is a magnificent object. The streets run through it and beside it. Vines occupy 
the crevices, and, nourished by the waiter, hang down in wide patches of green. 

The Labyrinth of Crete, the residence of the fabled Minotaur, can now be explored with safety 
only by the means furnished by Ariadne, that is^by a thread, to point out the way of return. 
The entrance is natural but very narrow, and opens into a wider passage, somewhat obstructed 
bj stones, and with a flat roof cut 'm the rock above. Â« On leaving this, it is necessary to creep 
100 paces through a low passage. From this the roof rises again, and various roads both dh> 
â–¼erge and cross each other ; they are about seven feet high, and from six to ten wide ; cut 
with the chisel in the rock. The number and complication of them are beyond description. 
Some curve graduaUy and lead to open spaces, with roofs supported by pillars. Savary un- 
folded 400 fathoms of line, without including lateral and other excursions, but did not examine 
the whole labyrinth. The air is unwholesome, and there are no stalactites. The dark recesses 
tre peopled by millions of bats. 

21. Population and Revenue. The population of this great empire is by no means equal 
either to its extent or fertility ; nor is it possible to state it with perfect accuracy. The tyran* 
ny under which the natives groan, the practice of polygamy, and the prevalence of the plague, 
all tend to check increase. It is thought that the number of inhabitants, including the 3 
principalities, is about 12,000,000. The public income arises from uncertain sources. One 
of the most pennanent is a miriy or tenth of the produce of the lands of \he whole empire. 
A property-tax, and a poll-tax, levied on .Greeks, Armenians, and Jews, together with the 
customs, are the odier permanent sources. The national income is augmented by confiFcations, 
casual contributions, and imperial exactions. The impositions on Christians are altogether Â«r* 
bitrary, and may consequently be extended to the most oppressive degree.

93. Hittory. The origin of the Tnrks, although comporativelx recent, is otÂ»cure. Their 
HUne begins lo appear in history about the middle of the 6th century, when they attracted iÂ» 
liee as a Scythian tribe, settled at tbe foot of the Altaian mountains, between Siberia mi 
Ohina. The Saracen caliphs of Bagdad chose their body-guards from this tribe ; and tin 
Turtdsh chiefs, gradually assuming authori^, at length engrossed the whole power of ibe ItiU 
tod' elevated thnoselves to the throne. In tbe 9th and lOtb centuries, Turkish dynistiei 
reigned in Palestine, Syria, and Egypt, but tbe proper founder of iba Ottoman Empire mi 
Omen, or Othman, a predatory chief, who conquered Asia Minor, and assumed the title of 
â€¢uhan, in 1300. ME^omet the Second conquered Constantinople in 1453, and this was tbe 
onrthrow of the Greek Empire. 

Tbe rapid progress of the TurkiBh arms, threatened tbe downfall of Christendom, but ths 
rigorous resistance of the Christian powers checked their incursions into the west of Europe, 
and in the 17th century tbe Ottoman power began to dechne; it encountered, the following 
century, a new enemy in the Russians, who first displayed to the world the secret of its intrb- 
wo weakness. The same nation may be considered as having accomplished tbe oTerUirow <^ 
the Turkish iofiuence in our own days, when in 1838 a Russian army crossed tbe Balkan, td- 
â–¼anced nearly to the gates of Constantinople, and dictated a peace to the Sultan. Turkey ii 
iko longer considered a first-rale European power, and, since that period, has been oUiged to 
submit to the loss of Greece. Still more recently she has been subjected to the deeper humil- 
iation, of seeing her empire neariy subverted by the Pacha of Egypt, who was only slopped ia 
bis career of conquest by the interference of the great powers of Europe. 

CHAPTER XXII. SWITZERLAND. 



FBTSfCAL GKOORAPUT. 

1. Boundaries and Extent. Switzerland is bounded north by tbe grand duchy of BddÂ« 
md the kingdom of Wurtemherg ; east by the Austrian province of Tyrol ; south by the 
Sardinian and the Lombardo- Venetian States, and west by France. It extends from 45Â° Sff 
to 47Â° 50" IS latitude, and from 5Â° 50* to 10Â° 30" E. longitude. Its length from east to west 
13 200 miles, its breadth from north to south 130 ; and its superficial extent has been estimated 
tt 17,000 square miles. 

2. Mountaint and Valleys. Two distinct ranges of mountains traverse Switzerland. Tbe 
chain of the Jwra stretches from southwest to northeast. The Mps form a more cxtensife 
chain, and mn nearly parallel to tbe Jura with nmnerous branches known among geograpbeH 
by tbe names of the Pennine, Lepontiae, and Rhatian Sips. These mounuins cover a great 
part of the country and exhibit inaccessible peakj covered with snow ; eternal and boundlev 
wastes of ice ; valleys surrounded by immense precipices ; in contrast with wooded and iÂ»>ta* 



swcteblahbi 



kriiig. rfopes, vlnd-clBd fields, and bright patches ct regetadoii* Momt Blanc^ tbe higheet 
iQHunit in Europe, overlooks the celebrated vale of CbamouDi in Savoy ; a district not coaik 
fgmed within the political limits of Switzerland, but which pertains to it in a geographioal 
character. This mountain is 15,814 feet in height ; it is capped with eternal snow, and tfai 
wpjfamch to the top is so full of difficulty and hazard that it has never been ascended, except in 
4 or 6 iastaneeB. Tbe ifebefjan, or LcponHne Alpe^ extend from Mount Ross to Mouot 
Bernardino ; their most elevated branch forms the northern boundary of the Valais, stretchiiig 
fiom the Lake of Geneva to Mount St. Gothard. The loftiest summit is FiMteraarh^my 
14,111 feet high ; tbe JanrfraUj or FtVjftn, is 13,718 feet high. The RhaHan Mp$ extend 
tbrougb the Grisons and lyrol, sending off a branch to Lake Constance. Some of their 
lommits hi Switzerland attain the height of 13,000 feet. 

One dislingQishing characteristic of the Swiss moubtaias is the Glaciers, whioh resemUe i 
Hormy sea, suddenly coi^ealed and bristling all over wkb sharp ridges.* The avalanches, er 
dips of snow, form another peculiar feature in the scenery of this country. There are innu* 
nerabte valleys, entirely desolated, and almost inaccessible to anything living life, in conse^ 
quenee of these tremendous visitations from the surrounding cliffs. Not only the snow-fields^ 
Mt mountains themselves, occasionally, slide down upon the country below. In 1806, a piec0 
of the Rossberg, twice as large as the ci^ of Paris, slipped down at once into the Lake o^ 
Lowertz, and occasioned the most dreadful devastation. Another accident of the same kind 
oecunred on the Lake of Lucerne, in 1801, when 11 persons were drowned at a village on the 
imposite side of the lake, by the wave raised by tbe plunge of the falling mass. Switzerland 
iDOofids b deep and romantic valleys, many of which are fertile and well-cultivated, and fuQ ot 
wild and picturesqae scenery. 

3. ittosrs. The Rhine has its three sources in the Rhstian Alps, and, passing through tbe 
Lake of Constance, flows to the westward, until it reaches Basle. The uhone is formed by 
ffiflfeient streams from Mounts Orimsel and Furca, and flows into the lake of Geneva. The 
Tumo issues from Mount Griers and traverses lake Maggiore in Italy. The Inn rises in the 
Grisons, runs northeast, and subsequently joins the Danube. The â€¢iar is tbe principal stream 
which has its coarse wholly in Switzerland. Rising in the Lepontine Alps, it traverses the^ 
lakes of Brientz and Thun, and, after receiving the waters of the lakes of Neufchatel, Zurich, 
Lucerne, and some other lakes, empties itself mto tbe Rhine. 

4. Lakes. The Lake of Geneva^ called also Leman, is 40 miles long. It is 1,230 feet 
above the lev^el of the sea, and its greatest depth is about 1,000 feet. The waters of this lake 
are beautifully transparent, and the surrounding scenery has long been celebrated for its magnif- 
icence. The Lake of Comtance is about 45 miles in length, and 15 in breadth. The Lake 
U^ano is at an elevation of 880 feet above tbe sea. The Lake of Lucerne^ or the Fov/r 
PortH Cantonsy is above 20 miles m length, and from 8 to 10 in breadth ; its greatest depth 
is dx)ut 600 feet, and its navigation ditngerous. Among the numerous other lakes are those 
of Zurieh^ Mufchatel^ TAtin, BrientZy Morat^ and BieL 

5. CUmate. From the great elevation of Switzerland, the air is pure and salubrious ; and 
tboogh in some of the narrow valleys, where radiation is great, the heat is often excessive, yet 
the atmosphere is in general much cooler than might be expected from the latitude. Three 
different climates may be said to exist in this country ; viz. the cold in the Alps, the temperate 
ia tbe pfauns, and the hot in the canton of Tesino. In the valleys, however, the temperature 
ef districts at a short distance from on^ another, often varies extremely. 

6. SoiL In the upper regions of Switzerland, which fall within the limits of cultivation, the 
â€¢oil is chiefly composed of particles crumbled from the rocks that tower above them, and is 
consequently stony and barren, or merely clothed with a scanty covering of short herbs ; but 
ia the lower tracts it is often rich and productive, and in a few places marshy. 

7. Geology. The Alps afibrd the materials of continual study to the geologist who examÂ»

mes them. Granitic rocks, of a date posterior to tbe formatioo of organJKed beings, make up 
the chaia connected with Mont Blanc. Different calcareous ramifications of tbe same duin 
extend a long wa^ northwards, and rise to a great height, while the granitic rocks on the tomb 
descend to the confines of Italr. 

8. Natural Productions. Forests of larch, pine, and Gr, intermixed with yew, moumni 
ash, and birch, clothe the sides of the Swiss Alps ; the oak, elm, ash, heech, lime, and cbnt- 
Dut flourish here. 

9. JiGnerals. Tbe mountains abound in marble, porphyry, and alabaster. Iron, lead, ca^ 
per, zinc, crystal, cobalt, bismuth, arsenic, and antimony are found in veins and masses. Quu^ 
ries of rock'salt are met with, particularly in the Pays de Vaud. 

10. ^nimah. Cattle are plentiful, and form the chief wealth of tbe inhabitanti. The taate 
animals are those common lo Europe ; among the wild ones are the ibex, the chamois, and 
tbe marmot, and in the unfrequented tracts, bears, lynxes, and wolves are common. Birds of 

prey are not unfrequent ; UDoaf 
which is the golden or beardea 
vidture, or lammer-geyer, which 
is ofteu known to carry off limb). 
II. Cataracts. The falls of 
the Rbine at SchalFhausen, ue 
tbe most celebrated in Europe ; 
they consist of a violent rapid of 
about 80 feet in descent ; die 
whole mass of water is brokeo 
into foam io the fall, and resem- 
bles a cataract of snow ; tbe rott 
and agitation surpass even Ni- 
agara. The falls of the Stiub- 
bach are produced by a smtU 
mountain torrent, which falls SOO 
feet into a rocky cleft ; ibe witer 
is dashed completely into vapor 
before it reaches the bottom. There are manj 
other cascades among the mountainous parts. 

13. Face of the Country. The general sur- 
face of Switzerland exceeds in nieged sublimi- 
ty any other portion of Eiu^pe. Nature seems 
here to have formed everythiog on her gnndesi 
scale, and offers the most striking cootrasis- 
Icy peaks rise into the air, close upon the 
borders of fertile valleys ; luxuriant comGelds 
are surrounded by immense and dreary plaiu 
of ice ; in one step, the traveler passes from 
the everlasdng snow to tbe freshest verdure) 
or from glaciers of chilling coldness to valleys 
from whf^e rocky sides ibe sunbeams are re- 
flected with almost scorching power. 

13. Roads. Bome of the Alpine passes in 
this country ere the result of immense labor 
and ingenuity. Those of St. Gothard and tbÂ« 
Simplon are the most frequented. Tbe Sim- 

Elon is a mountain situated in the chain of ibe 
igher Alps, between the Valais and Pied 
mont, in which is found a passage to Itidj. 
The old road being practicable only for foo^ 
passengers and travelers on horseback, in ISOl, 
Sin^ilon Road. BoDBparte directed a magnificent road to be con- 

structed, which was completed in 1S05. Be- 
tween diss, in the valley of the Rhone, where tbe road commences, and Domo d'Ossola, ia

FiedtnoDt, where it terminates, there are 4 forests of pine, upwards of 30 cascades, several gla- 
ders, 22 bridges, and 6 covered galleries, or tunnels, excavated through the solid rock. The 
roid 18 24 feet in width, bounded by strong railings' of larch, or parapets of granite, with small 
buildings erected at short distances, for the shelter of travelers. In many other places, roads 
hare been formed along the edges of precipices, bridges thrown over frightful chasms, and tun- 
neb cut through rocks ; and the mighty obstacles interposed by nature have been removed by 
the skill and boldness of art.

The largest cantons have an area of from 1,000 to 3,000 square rofles ; the smallest, of 
from 85 to 300. Population of the confederacy in 1845, 2,400,000. 

3. Canab. There are several canals in Switzerland, but none of great extent. The Ca-- 
nal of lAnth^ 1 5 miles in length, connects the Linth, by a navigable channel, with lakes Wal* 
lenstadt and Zuricbi^* It has been proposed to unite the waters of Lake Nedchatel with those 
of the Lake of Geneva by a canal. 

3. Towns. Zurich, Seme, ahd Lucerne become alternately, each for the space of two 
years, the capital of the confederation. Zurich has this privilege in 1889 and 1840 ; Berne, 
in 1841 and 1842 ; and Lucerne, in 1843 and 1844. 

Geneva is the most populous and flourishing city of Switzerland. It stands at the head of 
the lake of the same name, just where its waters are discharged into the Rhone. Its environs, 
filled with elegant villas, are remarkable for the beauty and magnificence of their scenery. GeÂ« 
neva is enriched by the industry of its inhabitants, who are also favorably distinguished for the 
interest they take in letters. This spirit pervades the laboring classes, and has acquired for 
Geneva the title of the Swiss Athens. Watchmaking is the most important branch of industry, 
occupying 3,000 persons, who make annually 70,000 watches. Other articles of gold and silÂ« 
^er, and scientific and' mechanical instruments, silks, cotton goods, porcelain, &c., are also pro- 
duced here. The commerce is likewise extensive, and the learned institutions numerous. 
Population, 31,000. 

Btme is a handsome city, delightfully situated upon the Aar ; its trade and manufactures are 
flourishing, and it contains a university, and various seminaries and scientific establishments. Its 
population is 24,000. In the vicinity is Hofwyly containing the celebrated farm-school of the 
phibnthropic Fellenberg. Fourteen miles west from Berne, is Morale where, in 1476, the 
freemen of Switzerland vindicated their liberty by a decisive victory over the invading hosts of 
Charles the Bold, duke of Burgundy. An obelisk has been erected here to commemorate the 
erent. 

Sik or Basel is the largest city of Switzerland,' but its population, amounting only to 23,000p

if BoK proportionate to its exteat. It is dbtiBgoishei for its erudition and its industiy, hsvilf 
an active trade, a flourishing commerce, and many learned institutions. Zurich is pleasamly 
situated on the Limmat, at the extremity of the pretty lake of the same name. Like Bale aaj 
Geneva, it has long been distinguished ror its cultivation of learning, and it has extensive nuwh 
iactures and a flourishing trade. Population, 15,000. 

Lausanne^ the capital of the Pays de Vaud, is much vbited by foreigners, on account of id 
delightful situation. It stands near the lake of Geneva, the banks of which are covered widi 
vineyards, while the snowy summits of the Alps rise in the distance. Gibbon resided here for 
some time. Population, 16,000. In the northern part of the canton is Yverdun, where Peiti- 
lozzi established his school. St. Crall contains a celebrated abbey, numerous roanuractures, 
and some literary institutions. Its trade is extensive. Population, 1 1,500, fHh^rg deserres 
notice on account of its nmnerous literary establishments and its Jesuit's college. Popula- 
tion, 9,200.* 

Lucerne^ on the lake of the same name, occupies a eentle eminence, and b surrounded by i 
wall and towers. Among its curiosities b the model of Switzerland, executed in relief by the 
late General PfyflTer. Population, 8,500. 

4. Agriculture. The nature of the country presents numerous obstacles to its cultivatioo ; 
but they have been, in a great ipeasure, overcome by the indastry of the inhabitants. The 
traces of the plough are visible on the sides of the precipices apparently inaccessible, and spots, 
which nature seemed to have doomed to eternal sterility, are crowned with vegetation. The 
produce of grain is generally equal to the consumption ; but pasturage b the chief object of 
the farmer. 

5. Manufactures and Trade. The chief manufactures are cotton and woolen goods, linai, 
silk, leather, jewelry ware, and particularly watches. Though m the centre of Europe, 8wit* 
zerland has been much restricted in its commercial intercourse, by die barriers of the Alps, 
and the prohibitory systems of the neighboring States. Of late years, however, all the branch- 
es of industry have been flourishing, and the various roads over the Alps, and the introduc- 
tion of steam navi^tion upon the lakes, have facilitated the intercourse with foreign natioDS, 
and between the different cantons. The principal exports are cattle, the productions of the 
dairy, and manufactured coods. The imports are principally com, flax, raw silk, cotton, 
spices, and various kinds of manufactured goods. 

' 6. InhfMtants. The Swiss have the beauty that comes from strength and health. Tbey 
are robust and temperate, but their countenances have little of the beau ideal. In the territo- 
ries that border on France, Germany, and Italy, there are French, Germans, and Italians, and 
there are a few Jews, principally m Aargau. 

7. Dress. The higher classes generally follow the French fashions ; but the common peo- 
ple have many peculiar forms of dress ; varying somewhat in the different cantcms, and all pic- 
turesque. They are less becoming, however, than the common prints would lead one to sap- 
pose. They are generally simple and convenient. The dress of the females is the most pe- 
culiar, for the men have no longer a national dress. It consbts partly in a short petticoat,

fduoh shows the stockings as high as the knee, and a wide, flatÂ«liat, without a crown, tied under 
tbe chio. Near Berne the hat gives place to a strange looking black cap, standing off the face, 
and in shape like the two wings of a outterdy. In some parts, tbe hair is plaited and pieced 
down to the heels. In Appenzel the modem invention of braces is not yet adopted ; the dress 
is a scaoty jacket and short breeches, and there is a preposterous interval between die two gar* 
mv^% woich tbe wearer makes frequent but ineflbctual hitches to close. 

8. Lauguag$* About two thirds of the Swks speak the German language, but often of a 
very corrupted dialect ; and tbe majority of the other third, French. The rest use the Ital* 
isB, and the Romanish, a corrupted dialect of the Latin, and not much unlike the colloquial 
hqguage of tbe Romans. 

9. Manmr of BtMding. There is some difference in this, in the various cantons and 
towns. In tbe canton of Vaud (and in many other places), the houses are often 80 or 10(1 
feet square, and though low they have a very high shingle roof, loaded with large stones, as a 
(lefence from the wind, and projecting in the piazea shape, over an outside gallery, up a flight 
of stairs. This is tbe part occupieo by the family. The lower story, barricaded with fire* 
wood, and buried in snow in winter, is the cellar, where provisions are kept, and domestic ani- 
mals are housed. These bouses are much exposed to fibres, and are under the protection of a 
motual insurance, at three fourths their value. They are chiefly built of stones, and some of 
tbem are thatched, or tiled. 

At Berne and Neufchatel are a great many fountains of the purest water ; at the latter city, 
ibej Oow into gigantic basins. The lofty terraces at Berne nave a very imposing look, and 
the massy arcades, here and at Bienne, like the arches of a bridge^ and on which the houses are 
built, give tbe towns a strange and massy appearance. On the ends of many houses are writ- 
tea the names of the builders, or occupants, with verses from Scripture. There are few pub 
lie buildings in Switzerland of much architectural grandeur, though there are many venerable 
with age. Tbe shepherds have rude chalets of logs, or stones, as temporary tenements. 

10. Food and Drink. The Swiss are ahnost a pastoral people, and much of their subsist* 
eoceis drawn from their flocks and herds. Bread is a luxury in many valleys in. the Alps, 
where milk and its preparations form the basis of nutriment. In the mountainous part of Berne, 
â€¢ custom still exists, for many families connected by affinity or marriage, to make in common a 
cheese of enormous size. On it are carved the names of parties about to be married, and 
the cheese often serves for the marriage of their descendants. In some remote parts, every 
bmij with a years' provision, may feel the dignity' of wealth, and the people by way of osten- 
tatioo, offer to visiters mouldy food, to show that they have on hand the provision of a pre- 
ceding year. Wine and spirits are somewhat used in Switzerland, but the mhabitants are tem- 
Crate. Much tobacco is consumed, chiefly in smoking. The pipes are of silver, with lai^e 
wis, and hang down upon the breast. 

11. Disease^. Switzerland is highly salubrious. There are, however, pulmonary complaints, 
vid the usual alpine diseases, particularly goitres, prevail in various parts. 

12Â» TVaveUng. Tbe facilities for foreigners to travel in Switzerland, are less than the in- 
ducements. The air of the mountains, however, wiU create an appetite for the plain and sim- 
ple food that is generally found at the inns. Within the present century there were no inns in 
the mountains, and the traveler stopped at the house of a clergyman or substantial farmer. Tlie 
roads are of all kinds ; some bard and smooth, havmg seats and fountains, at regular distances ; 
hat more are impassable to carriages, and scarcely sale for the sure instinct of mules. On some 
routes there are regular post coaches ; but generally the traveler, unless he walks, hires his own 
conveyance. In the mountains a ehar-a'-Danc is used, a light carriage of 2 flexible bars on 4 
J^'heeb. Two or three people sit sideways upon the bars, and the driver sits in front. There 
i& but one horse. Many travelers prefer to explore Swit2erland on foot, a cheaper and not 
lÂ«Â» expeditious mode of traveling. 

13. Character J Manners, and Customs. The Swiss, like all moimtaineers, are attached to 
their country, which they have often defended against fearful odds. It is remarkable, that coun- 
tries the least fertile are the most beloved by the inhabitants ; an Italian or a Spaniard may be 
Rented in exile, but seldom a Swiss ; and an Esquimaux or a Greenlander finds nothing in 
Evope to compensate absence from his barren rocks and icy seas. The Swiss neverthdesi 
^OBkrates, though he often returns when be has acquired a competency, to his sublime, but un- 
Pmuctiye mouolains.

Tbe Swiss bare a quiet temperament, and mediocritv of genius. The countiy has produc- 
ed few men distinguished for genius ; though collectively tbe 
people have performed great achievements. They have nothing 
of the melancholic, poetic character, that distinguisbes tbe 
Highlanders of Scotland, or their Italian neighhors on the other 
side of the Alps. They are moral, faitbfiJ, industrious, and 
brave, and they are the only people in Europe, who have habit- 
ually served aa mercenaries in foreign armies. Bui in every 
service they have proved their courage and fidelity. They re- 
tun much of their pastoral simplicity, and may be characterized 
as a race of heroic husbandmen, worthy to be the couotrymeo 
of Tell. They are familiar with the use of arms, and there is 
a law that no one shall be married, who has not arms, untform, 
and equipments. 

At Oeneva, the mode of life is extremely social. The niria 
are constant, from November till spring. The ladies go to tbem 
S"!**- on foot, preceded by a servant with a lantern, for there are few 

carriages or sedans at Geneva. These meetings Vesemble family assemblages, in their freedom 
from the constraints imposed by etiquette. A stranger is struck with the affectionate terms by 
which women of all ages address each other, such as mon caur, ma mignonnt, man ange. 
These come from the influence of certain " Sunday Societies," in which children meet at 
their parents' houses, where they are left 1o themselves, and have a light supper of fruit, pastry, 
&Q. The friendships thus formed endure through life, and the youthful expressions of fondness 
are never dropped. 

At Zurich there is less social visiting. The men arc inveterate smokers, and have their own 
meetings, in an atmosphere of smoke, that no female could endure. In the canioD of Berne 
there is a custom of Saturday night visitine among young people, somewhat resembling a prac- 
tice unjusdy attributed to New England. Young men who are there engaged in agricultural la- 
bors, have litde lime for visiting but on Saturday nights. The young women, who generally 
expect company on that night, are seated at the windows neatly dressed, and ihey answer the 
form of salutation, which is in verse, by another verse, either in the affirmative or the negative. 
The visiter, if not repulsed at this stage of the siege, climbs up to the window of an upper 
story, on certain projections of the wooden house\ where be siis a while, and further parley is 
held, when he takes some refreshment, generally cWry-brandy and gingerbread. Sometimes 
tlie visiter advances no further than the window, but of^en be is admittefl to the chamber. This 
proceeding is so open to observation, that it loses soin^of its indelicacy, while it subjects the 
accepted swain on his late return, to the cudgels of his liies fortunate rivals. For this reason, 
young men frequently escort one another, on such occasions. 

14. ^muaemenlg. Hunting the chamois is perhaps rather an employment than an amusement 
iu Switzerland ; for many pursue it constantly. The pursuit, though enticing and fascinatmg, 
is full of danger, and few hunters attain to age, or receive Christian burial. They go to tbe 
mountains and never return ; being crushed by falling ice or stones, or mangled by a fall intc 
some covered gap, or from some giddy and slippery precipice. The hunter must have steadi- 
ness of nerve, hardihood, and contempt of death. He must climb icy barriers, where a slip 
of hand or foot would precipitate him down a fathomless abyss, or stand in a gale upon a pin- 
nacle of a rock, with tbe confidence of tbe chamois itself, where, as Gray said, a goat may 
<* dance and scratch an ear with its hind foot, in a place where I could not have stood still for 
all beneath the mooa." 

The chamois is a timid and sagacious animal ; the hunter creeps toward a Bock, with his 
shirt over his clothes, and lies motionless in the mow, for half an hour, if the herd appear 
alarmed. At the distance of about 250 steps, he aims at the darkest coat, which generally in- 
dicates the fattest animal. Accustomed to the detonations of the mountains, the chamois some- 
times stand a second shot, if they do not see the smoke, or scent the powder. The other 
amusements of tbe Swiss are dancing, and the sports and games common m Europe. 



SWlt2BRt4AND. 138ft 

li. Eiueatbm. lo this, the Protestant cantons excel tba CatfaoliCi though neither, exoept 
Geneva, have kept pace with the spirit of the times. Switzerland has three universities, those 
of Basle, of Zurich, founded in 1833, and of Berne, founded in 1834. The surperiority of edu- 
cation in Geneva is greatly owing to maternal care and zeal, and to the effect of the Sunday 
Societies. At Yverdun is the school (bunded by Pestalozzi, in which it is the great aim of the 
teacher to make the pupils construct the sciencra themselves, as far as they are able, without the 
artificial rules which might facilitate their progress, but leave them in ignorance of the rationale 
of a science. At Hofwyl, near Berne, is the school of De Fellenberg, who, in bb celebrated 
institution, has united agriculture, he. with education, though education is the primary object. 
His system is the 'best to show on a large scale, how the children of the poor may be taught, 
and their labor at the same time profitably applied ; and if it were universal, wouM change the 
moral aspect of the world. In executing it, however, much depends on the personal character 
of the teacher. The pupils go to their work soon after sunrise, having first breakfasted and 
received a lesson of about half an hour. At noon they return, and after dinner, which takes 
half an hour, a lessen follows of 1 hour, and then work till 6. On Sundays the lesson takes 
6 hours. The boys seldom see books ; they are taught viva voce a few matters of fact, and rules 
of practical application ; much of their education is moral, and they grow up in habits of indus- 
try, kindness, and veracity. 

16. Statt of the Jlrts^ Sciences^ and Literaiure. At Geneva, and in some other towns, 
there is a general taste for the arts, which is so far cultivated, that the ladies commonly draw 
with much precision. Mr. Decandolle, at Geneva, having borrowed for a few davs, a great 
coIIecti(xi of drawings of Ainerican plants, 860 m number, and filling 13 folio volumes, had 
them well copied in a week, by 1 14 female artists. Switzerland, however, has not produced 
any leading artists ; the best have been Holbein, Graff, and Angelica Kaufiinann. The talent 
for music, especially in the German cantons, is general. The ranz des vaches is an air singik- 
larly wild and melancholy, and when sung, is broken by a sudden shriek, like the war-song of 
an American savage. A. peculiar strain like this is associated with the remembrance of home j 
and the impressive scenes of Switzerland have a powerful effect on the Swiss in foreign coun- 
tries ; in some military servil^es it has therefore neen forbidden to play the ranz des vaches. 
The literature is merged in that of Germany and France. The French cantons have produced 
Beza, Causabon, Necker, Be Stael, Huber, Le Sage, Rousseau, Sismondi, Decandolle, &c., 
and the German cantons, Haller, Gessner, Lavater, Paracelsus, and others. 

17. Religion. The Reformed or Calvinistic Protestants from three fifths of the population, 
most of the remainder being Catholics ; but there are a few Lutherans, Anabaptists, and Jews. 
The Catholics have 190 cloisters, and 3,500 recluses. The Protestant form of church gov* 
ernment is Presbjrterian. The Catholic religion predominates in 10 cantons, and the Protest- 
ant in 12. In several, however, both creeds are mingled, and all parties live m much harmonv. 

18. Government, Each canton is a sovereign state, but the 22 cantons are united by the 
act of confederacy into a federal body for the preservation of order, and the security of liberty 
and independence. The diet or federal congress is composed of deputies from the cantons, 
each canton having one vote. The president of the diet, who is considered the chief magis- 
trate of the confederation, is styled tne Landammann ; this dignity is borne by the chief of the 
canton in which the session of the diet is held. The diet has power to make war and peace, 
contract alliances, and make treaties with foreign States ; regulates the military contingent of 
each canton,Scc. The standing army in peace is hut l,200orl,300men;thewarcontingent64,019 
men. Each canton, like the States in this country, is governed by its own laws, and the con- 
stitutions of government are various ; Neufchatel is a constitutional monarchy, the king of Prus- 
sia being its executive head ; Berne, Lucerne, Friburg, and Soleure are aristocracies ; the 
other 17 cantons have constitutions based on more or less democratic forms and principles.* 

19. Laws. Justice is generally well administered in Switzerland ; but this is as much from 
the good spirit of the people, as the excellence of the laws. The revolutions of the present 
century have, however, much ameliorated the system. At Zurich, the legal proceedings are- 
secret ; and if there is corruption, it is not of the kind which comes from venality. The toi^ 
ture by Hogging, was imtil lately applied ad libitum^ to extort confession ; now it is regulated 
by a special order of court, prescribbg the number of lashes ! The administration of justice 
in France is better than in most of the Swiss cantons.

30. .^nliftttHef. At Aagst, DOt fv from Bale, tra tbe ruins of a Roman city, partly tinder 
[he level of the Rhine. The theatre, aqueduct, and walls are indistinct ; but there are b iba 
library at Bile 12,000 medals, cbiefiy found in these ruins. It is supposed, that tbe cityvn 
destroyed by an earthquake. At Aveucbe, the ancient Aveoticum, are, among other aQtiqoi- 
ties, mosaic pavements, sculptured cornices, &e. The bridge of St. Maurice, over the Rhone, 
was built by the Romans ; it is very narrow bft solid. It has a single arch of 300 feet, rest- 
mg on mountains on either side, gigantic abutments of 8,000 feet. 

21. Population, Revenue, &c. The population is estimated at 3,000,000. Tbereveow 

of the country, before it was conquered by the French, was 4,662,000 dollars. At present 

it is about balf that sum. It is raised from domain lands, taxation, and customs. Each cuk 

ton supplies a certain contingent to the general army of the confederacy, which amounts to 

about 33,000 men, and the internal strength of the country is further increased by a body rf 

militia. It is calculated, that above 30,000 Swiss are employed in the service of fordgn 

States. 

33. Hittory. Tbe Swiss are tbe descendants of the ancient Helvetii, subdued by Juliui 

Cesar. They continued long U7.der a DomJul 

subjection to Austria, till about the year 130D, 

when the emperor Albert tbe First treated them 

with so much rigor, that they rose in rebellion. 

William Tell slew Gesler the Austrian viceroy, 

and delivered bis countrymen. On this occasion, 

(he three cantons of Uri, Schweitz, and Un- 

derwalden. In 1308, entered into a league for 

mutual defence. At a later period, the other 

cantons were successively included, and in 1513, 

tbe federative re])ublic was complete. Swiim- 

land was overrun by tbe French armies in 179S, 

and the government experienced some alten- 

lWJ*tttfÂ«*rtÂ»4vl"VÂ»Â«'Â«>Â»''*-A ''Â°"*- Geneva and the Valais were, for a time, 

annexed to trance, but were subsequently re- 

â– tored. A new constitution was established in 1814. Switzerland is nominally a neutnl aod 

independent power, but the influence of Austria is felt and acknowledged in every part of iba 

confederacy. 

CHAPTER XCII. GENERAL VIEW OF THE EMPIRE OF AUSTRIA. 

1. Boundaritt. The Austrian Empire is bounded on the N. by Bavaria, Saxonv, Piusoi, 
and Poland ; on the E. by Russia and (he principality of Moldavia ; on the S. by WBllachii, 
Bervia, the Ottoman Empire, the Adriatic, and tbe Po ; and on the W. by Sardinia, SwitMf 
land, and Bavaria. It extends from 42Â° to 51Â° N. iat., and from 8Â° to 2GÂ° E. long., havii| 
an area of 355,000 square miles, with 35,879,153 inhabitants, by the census of 1842.* 

3. Mourttaim. Austria is traversed in different directions by numerous chains of the pell 
Alpine and Carpathian systems of mountains. The mountainous chains to the south of tbe 
Danube belong to tlie former. The Rhetian Alps traverse the Tyrol ; of which the Ortlw, 
12,850 feet high, is the loftiest summit. The J^Coric Alps extend across Saltzburg and SiiriÂ» 
to the neighborhood of Vienna ; principal summit, Gross Glockner, 12,755 feet high. Tbe 
Comic AlpÂ» extend from tbe sources of the Brenta to Villach, separating Tyrol and Carinihii 
from the Venetian provinces ; highest summit 1 1 ,500 feet. A continuation of this cbaio ex- 
tends to the southeast under the name of the Julian Alp$. 

The principal chain of the Carpathian Mountains surrounds the plains of Hungary like â€¢ 
semicircle, separating Hungary and Transylvania from Moldavia and Galicia, and dividing llw 
waters of the Baltic from those of the Black Sea ; they terminate at Orsova on the DantAe- 
None of their summits exceed the height of 10,000 feet. A western branch of this system 
exieods from the sources of the Oder to those of the Elster, under the general name of tbe 
Svdetie MomUaias. They have an elevation of from 3,000 to 5,000 fcei.

EMPIRE OF AUSmtA. 291 

3* Rufâ‚¬r$. Austria abounds in navigable rivers, which find their waj to the 4 great seas of 
Europe. Those of Austrian Italy have already been described. The Danube traverses ibm 
governments of Upper and Lower Austria, and part of Hungary, in an easterly direction, then 
turning to the south, reaches the southern frontier of the latter kingdom, and, flowing easterly, 
separates it from Servia, and enters the Ottoman empire at Orsova. Its principal tributaries m 
Austria are the Morava or Marsch^ and the Theisa from the north ; and the Mnn^ the Draive^ 
tnd the Save on the south. The Elbe traverses Bohemia, and passes bto Prussia ; the Mol^ 
(btt, which flows into it below Prague, is its principal tributary. The Oder rises in the Su- 
detic Mountains, and passes north into Prussia. The Vistula^ which rises in the Carpathitti 
Mountains, enters Poland ; and the Dniester has its source in the same mountains, but takes a 
contrary direction and enters Russia. 

4. Divisions. Geographers often describe Austria as divided into four great sections : the 
German provinces ; tlie I'olbh provinces, or that part of Poland, which has been annexed to 
the empire ; the Hungarian districts ; and the Italian provinces. The political division of the 
empire is into 15 governments, differently denominated and regulated, and variously subdivided 
into circles, provinces, counties, &c. The following table contains a view of these various diÂ« 
visions. 

German Provinces. Governments. 1. Upper Austria; 2. Lower Austria ; 3. Tyrol; 
4. Duchy of Stiria ; 5. Laybach, and 6. Trieste (forming the kingdom of lUyria); 7. king* 
dom of Bohemia ; and 8. government of Moravia and Silecia : 

Polish Province. Government. 9. Kingdom of Galicia : 

Italian Provinces. Gjovemments. 10. Milan ; and 11. Venice (forming the Lombardo* 
Venetian kingdom) : 

HIjngarian Provinces. Governments. 12. Kingdom of Hungary (comprismg the king* 
doms of Sclavonia and Croatia) ; 13. Transylvania ; 14. the Military Frontiers ; and 15. the 
kingdom of Dalmada. 

5. Jlgriculture. Although Austria presents a great extent of good soil, agriculture is in so 
backward a state, that it is not highly productive. The processes and implements of husband* 
ry are extremely imperfect. A considerable part of the country is covered with forests, which 
supply the inhabitants with fuel, coal being little used. There are extensive pastures in the 
Hungarian provinces, and natural forests, which contain vast herds of cattle in a wild state 
Some of the wines of Austria are highly esteemed, but the difficulties of transportation pre- 
vent them from being largely produced for exportation. The wine of Tokay, in Hungary, is 
particularly celebrated. 

6. JUanufactwres. The manufactures of Austria are extensive in the aggregate, but the ope* 
rations are generally carried on upon rather a small scale, and the Austnans have neither tnat 
perfection of finish nor that ingenious machinery, which are to be found in the workshops of 
western Europe. Woolen, linen, and cotton goods, paper, cutlery, and hardware, leather, and 
glass, are the most important articles of manufacturing industry. 

7. Commerce. Austria b unfavorably situated for foreign commerce ; her northern provinces 
communicate with the sea only through the Elbe and the Vistula, by a long and difficult naviga- 
tion ; the eastern have navigable waters, which lead to countries not adapted for commercial 
operations, and the maritime coast on the Adriatic, although it has some good harbors, is sepa- 
rated from the interior by mountainous ranges, which render communication difficult. Trieste 
is the principal port, and displays considerable commercial activity. Fiume is the inlet to the 
Hoogarian provinces, and Ragusa, to Dalmatia. The inland trade of Austria is active and 
flourishing. 

8. Religion. The Roman Catholic religion is professed by a very great majority of the in- 
habitants. The adherents of the Greek church are numerous in Transylvania, the southern 
part of Hungary, and in Croatia, Sclavonia, and Galicia. There are many Protestants in Hud* 

?ry, Galicia, and the German provinces, and some Socinians or Unitarians in Transylvania 
he number of Greek Christians is about 3,000,000; that of Prostestants, 3,000,000, and that 
of Catholics, 29,000,000. There are nearly 700,000 Jews, chiefly in Galicia, Moravia, Hun- 
gary, and Bohemia. AH religions are tolerated in Austria. The archbishop of Vienna is the 
bead of the Austrian church ; the landed property of the church is extensive, and there are 300 
abbeys, and above 500 convents in the empire. There are 12 Roman Catliolic archbishops, 
and 61 bishops, and the property of the church is estimated to amount to 90,000,000 of dollairSt 
Among the Catholics are reckoned 3 1-2 millwns of conformed Greek Christiaos. 



MS WMfmS Of AITSTBIA. 

0. SAication. Tbere are gereo UDiversities in the empire, besides those of the Italioi prov- 
inces ; at Olmatz, Vienna, Prague, Pestb, Lemberg, iDospruck, and Gr^tz. High schools and 
primaiy schools have also been established in which are instructed nearly two millions and a half 
of pupils. But the restraints upon the press and freedom of speech, render the Austrian incu- 
rious upon many moral and political subjects, which occupy the minds and pens of men in freer 
countries, and shutout large fields of literature from popular inquiry. 

10. Get>â‚¬mmeiU. The sovereign is styled the emperor of Austria, and the govemmeot, with 
&ome diversities in the different parts, is absolute in all, except in Hun^y and Transylvania. 
In Hungary there is a diet, composed of the clergy, the nobility, deputies of the royid cities, 
and of the boroughs, which Has the right of making laws in concurrence with the king, as the 
emperor is there styled, and of layine taxes. The constitution of Transylvania is similar. 
There are assemblies of the estates in ^bemia and Galicia, but their powers are merely nom- 
inal. In the hereditary States, as the archduchy of Austria, Stiria, Carinthia, and Carmola are 
called, the power of the emperor b uncontrolled, but is exercised with mildness. The Milita- 
ry Frontiers have entirely a military administration, and, m fact, are nothmg more than a vast 
military oolony, under the immediate management of the minister of war. They consist of a 
narrow tract extending along the northern frontiers of Turkey and the southern boundary of 
Hui^ary and Transylvania, and -divided into four generalats or generabhips. The inhabitants 
enjoy die use of the land which th^ cultivate, on condition of rendering certain military servi- 
ces, and all are, therefore, tramed to military exercises. Even civil afiairs are here conducted 
in a military form, and the magistrates have military titles. The purpose of this singular iosti- 
tudon is to maintain a disciplined army of cultivators of the soil, always in readiness to defend 
the frontiers against the* Turks. 

11. InhabitanU. The mbabitants of tUs great empire bdong to several entirely distinct 
races. 1. The Germans form the population of the archduchy of Austria, the greater ^art of 
that of Stiria and Tyrol, and the minority m the Hungarian and Polish provinces, and in Bo- 
bemia, Moravia, and Silesia. 2. The Sclavonic race, comprising nearly one half of the popu- 
k^ion, consists of severid different people ; these are the Tzecfas, or Bohemians ; the Slowac , 
in Monavia and Him^iry ; the Poles, m Galicia ; the Wends, m Stiria, Camiola, Carinthia, 
-and Tjrrol ; the Croatians, Dalmatians, &c. 3. The Uralian race comprises the dominant 
people of Hu nga ry and Transylvania, or the Magyars. 4. The Latin race comprises the Ital- 
ians, and the Wallachians of Hungary, Transylvania, and die Military Fronders. 

The Sclavoniens, scattered^ as we have described, over a great extent, are the most back- 
ward and ignorant part of the populadon. They are commonly employed in mere rustic lab<Â»^} 
4md many of them are still in a state of servitude. Thus in Bohemia and Moravia, the Ger- 
man populadon' conducts public affairs, transacts commercial operadons, and exercises the me- 
chanic arts, while the Sclavonians are the common laborers ; and in Hungary, the Magyss, 
who, though in general illiterate, are a spirited and intelfigent race, and fond of acdve empkqr- 
ments and a military life, leave the more servile kinds of labor to the Sclavonic inhabitants ^ the 
Sclavonians, in fact, are the conqu^ed aborigines, who were reduced to slavery or kept in a 
subordmate state by their conquerors. In the Polish provinces, where the Sclavonians form 
akhost the whole population, they evmce an aversion from mechanic arts and conunerce, and 
the traders and deialers there, as in Poland, are mosdy Jews.

CHAPTER XXIII. THE HUNGARIAN STATES. 

These States constitute a pomon of the Austrian Empire, and consist 1st, of the Kingdom 
oT Hungary, nith the pronnces of Sclayonia and Croatia ; 3d, the Frincipaiity of Transybwua ; 
3d, the Military Frontiers ; and 4tb, the Kingdom of Dalmatia. The whole of Aese comt- 
tries togethw, bare a sur&ce of 130,000 square miles, with a population of 13,800,000. 

I. Kingdom of Hvngary. This country is bounded nortbnest by Moravia ; northeast by 
Galicia ; east by Transylvania ; south by the Military Frontieup ; southwest by Illyria ; andi 
west by Stiria and the Arcbducfay of Austria. Its length is 330, and its breadth 300 miles ; 
containing 89,000 square miles. The Crapack or Carpathian jHfounlaini extend along the 
northeastern border. Near the centre of the chain, is the LomniU peak, which is about 8, MO 
feel above the level of the sea. Among the detached mountains are those of Matra, Avas, and 
Farkas. An immense plain, comprehending all Eaatem Hungary, liea between tbe Duiubs 
and the Transylvanian Mountains. Aimilier large plain, of a ttiaugular form, nnis from the 
boundaries of Stiria to tbe Bakoaian Mountabs. 

Hungary does not border upon any sea, but is watered by very large riven. The prufbipal 
is tbe Dannbe, to tbe basin of which, all the others, except tbe Poprad, wfaicb runs mto the 
Vistula, belong ; tbe chief tributaries are the Leitha, tbe Maab, tbe fVaag or Vag, die Gnm, 
the Drove, tbe Sme, and the ThtitB or IHaza ; the whole course vt the Tbeiss is 3&0 mSes, 
aad it abounds in fish. There are many lakes in this country ; the Flatten or Bataton, 
near the centre of Lower Hungary, is about 45 miles long, and 8 broad ; the Jfeuauclfer, oa 
the frontier of Lower Anstria, is a sdt water lake of about SO square miles, and is surreimded 
by fens. 

Tbe climate is, on dw wboie, wanner than that of Germany. In the valleys, tmw fidla as 
early as September, and seldom disappears before the middle of June. Id the middle legioDB, 
the air is most pure and hetdtby. The flat countir is unbealll^. The soil is sterile on the 
highlands, but improves in queliQr as the elevatioo lessens, and is bixuriouslv rich on the jdiiBs. 
Yet even in tbe most fertile tracts, there occur barren h^ths of several miles in extent, where 
not a shrub is visible. Tbe Hungarian and Transylvanian forests cover a space of 11,644 
fquare miles. 

There are a great number of mineral springs, and minei of gold, silver, lead, and copper ; 
very rich ore of antimonr, coal, salt, and alum, an 
lAundant. About 40 miles to ^e south of the Cra- 
pack, are tbe gold and silver mines of Cremnitz ; and 
20 miles further to tbe south, are the silver mines of 
Schenmitz. Tbe gold mine at Cremniiz has been 
wrought for 1,000 years and upwards, and is exceed- 
, ingly rich. There is a mint here, where all the mine 
towns of Hungary and Transylvania send their gold 
and silver to be coined. The number of miners em- 
ployed by the crown at Schemnilz, is 8,000. A min- 
eral pectUiar to Hungary is tbe opal, which is found at 
aOtMSiu. Czernwenicza, a short distance to the north of Kas- 

chau. The bill in which the opab are found, consists 
of a decon^Kned porphyry, and tbe gems occur at tbe distance of a few fathoms from the 
surface. 

Hungary has in all ages been celebrated for its breed of horses, which are generally mouse- 
colored, and highly esteemed in war. The horned cattle are targe, active, and vigorous. Buf- 
laloes are not tmcommon. Among tbe wild animals are wolves, bears, and boars ; but these 
are very rare. 

Hungary may be considered as a great oval plain, surrounded on all sides but the south by 
lofty mountains, whence numerous and large rivers have their source, which gradually decline 
in velocity as tbey approach the plain, where, owing to the extreme flatness of the suiface, and 
looseness of tbe soil, their currents are scarcely perceptible. 

Near Szadelo, about 30 miles from Kascbau, is an extraordinary cavern, which is sud tD 
reach several miles under the hills, but has never been completely explored. Near Sniitz, is 
â– aoriier celebrated cavern, about 100 feet m broadtb, 150 in length, aad 3S in height ; in one

COnMH- IS a great mass of ice. There are two large navigable canals in (his country, vie ibe 
Francit Canal, betweea the Danube and the Theiss ; and the Bega Canal extending from 
Ficset to Becskerek. 

Btida, the capital of HuORary, stands upon the right bank of the Danube, opposite Pttik, 
with which it is connected b; a bridge of boats. It coniainB the palace of the vicerof of 
Htingary, and several other public buildings. Peslh is the lai^est, most populous, and active 
city of the ldngdom,.and each of its four annual fairs attracts S0,000 strangers from Hungaiy, 
and other provinces odthe empire, and from Turkey. It is well built, containing many etegmi 
public edi6ces, and mansions .of the Hungarian nobility- lu university is one of the most 
richly endowed on the continent. The populatioa of the two cities is 135,000, of which 
90,000 ire in Pesth. 

Praburg is a well-biult city on tbe Danube, with 4S,000 inhabitants. It was formerly the 
capital of Hungary, and the Hungarian djet is stiU occasionally beU here ; it is chiefly renia^ 
ewe for the great number of its institutions for education. 

Dtbrttzin is the principal town in eastern Hungary, and tbe chief manulacturiog place in the 
kingdom. Population, 60,000. Its four annual fairs are attended by great numbers of traders ; 
its manufactures comprise coarse woolens, leather, pottery, soap, &c. Thererien^adt nd 
Kitikemet are large towns with extensive manufactures of woolens, leather, soap, &c. ; tbe 
fiimer has 44,000, the latter 40,000 mbabiUnts. 

Bthemniti, with 20,000 inhabitants, and Kremnitx, with 6,000, are remarkable for their 
rich gold and silver mines. J\Sitchkoioex is a large town, with an active trade in com, wine, 
and leather ; in its vicmity are numerous forges, ^ass-works, and paper-works. Populitioo, 
90,000. Ttttutuar, one of the strongest fortresses in the empire, owes its commercial acdvi- 

?to a canal, which connecu it with the Danube. Population, 18,000. Sztgedin, on lbs 
hfliss, has an extensive trade, with manuEgctures of tobacco, soap, woolen goods, and boots. 

P(H)ulation, 33,000. 

Most branches of agriculture are still m tbeu- inftncy here. Hemp, flax, poppies, and 10- 

bftcco are cultivated on a large scale, particularly the latter. Mulberry trees are plenty. 

Manufactures are little attended to ; the raw produce being easily sold to the neighboring states. 

The only article manufactured for exporution is leather. The commerce is subject to great 

mtrictions from the Austrian system of taxation. We have no certain accounts of the reve- 

one, but it is thought to be about 13,000,000 dollars. The army consists of 46,000 infaatiy, 

ad 17,000 cavaliy. 

Sclmonia extends between the Drave and the Saave, and contiuns about 3,700 square miles. 

Nwrly 3,500,000 sheep are fed on the Sclavonian pastures ; and the annual produce of gniD is 

estimated at an avenge of 
13,000,000 bushels. Cap- 
ital, Esztk,

maritime districts, denomi- 
-nated (he Littoral, and ibe 
3 counties of Agram, Wans-

miles. Jlgram, or Sagrabn 
is the capital, and contains 
30,000 inhabiiants. TIk

Ifoldanli ; southeast and south by Wallachia ; and west ^ Hungary. It hes t>etween 4t^ 
3y and 48^ N. latitude, and between 22^ 30^, and 27^ E. londtude. Its length is 180, 
and its breadth 150 miles ; and it contains 23,000 square miles. It is surrounded on all sides 
by ranges of mountains, some of which are covered with perpetual snow. It contains many 
(Mighnul valleys, watered by innumerable streams, which enter the Maro$ch and â€¢dlauto, tM 
two main rivers of the country. There are several lakes and marshes ; among the latter of 
which the HeUmorasB, near Kovaszna, is remarkable on account of its unfathomable depth. 
The climate is more temperate and wholesome than that of Hungary ; but the water in mamr 
phces is strongly impregnated with minerals, and is apt toproduce cholics. The soil is gooa, 
and the rich pastures feed vast numbers of black cattle. There are extensive forests, inhabited 
by bufialoes, bears, lynxes, elks, wild asses, wild boars, chamois, ermines, and beavers. It has 
vahiable mines of gold, silver, and copper ; also of iron, quicksilver, lead, zinc, and antimony ; 
and produces great quantities of fossil salt. Klawenbergj or KotosvaVj the capital of TranÂ« 
sylvania, on the Szamos, contains 20,000 inhabitants. Moron Vasarhthu or JV*eiimarfeel, on 
the Marosch, has several fine buildings ; among others, is the palace of Tekeli, with a litouy 
6[ 60,000 volumes. Population, 13,000. Ilemumniiadt^ with 21,000 inhabitants, and Kmm- 
tiadiy with 30,000, are the other principal towns. 

Agriculture is the principal occupation of the bhabitants, but it is still carried on in a very 
primitive manner. The trade is in the hands of the Greeks and Armenians ; and the imp<MrtÂ»- 
tion probably exceeds the exportation. There are no manufactures of importance. Popula* 
tion, 2,000,000. 

In 1004, Transylvania was subdued by Stephen, king of Hungary, who introduced Christi- 
ani^. Some centuries afterwards, it was divided between two rival factions, one of which was 
supported by the house of Austria, and the other hy the Ottoman Porte ; and in 1606,. the 
successors of the latter power obliged the court of Vienna to acknowledge the independence 
of Transylvania. It was ceded to the Austrians, by the treaty of Carlowitz m 1699, and all 
dnms were setded by the peace of Belgrade, in 1740. 

3. The Military fVofiHert. This country extends along the Turkish frontiers from the 

Adriatic to Galicia, and surrounds the provinces of CroaÂ« 
tia, Sclavonia, Hunagry, and Transylvania. The superficial 
extent is 18,400 miles. The Sclavonians form the largest 

Proportion of the inhabitants, amounting to above 800,000. 
?here are also 122,000 Wlaches, 80,000 Magyars and 
Szeckhelyi, 9,000 Germans, 1,500 Klementins, and about 
1,500 Greeks, Jews, and Gypsies. There is no nobifity, 
nor any privileged class among the inhabitants of the fron* 
tiers, which yet form a complete military state, having ma- 
ny points of resemblance to the feudal institutions of the 
middle ages. The frontier government was originally ere* 
ated to protect the empire, oT which it forms a part, against 
the invasion of barbarians, and m later times to form a 
cordon ianitaire against the plague. All landed property 
is held by a kind of fief, on condition of military service 
in peace and war. Only such boys as are not fit for the 
service are aUowed to engage in any other occupation than 
that of qrms. There are 4 divisions of the military firon- 
tiers, containing in nil 11 towns, 24 boroughs, 4 fortresses, 
and 1 ,995 villages. 

4. Dalmatia. This kingdom is bounded north by Hun* 
gary, east by Bosnia and Kumelia, and south and west by 
Chmrd qf Military FnmHmr. ^^ Adriatic. It lies between 42^ 1 5', and 44^ 25' N. lat., 

and contains about 5,800 square miles. The interior is intersected by high mountains. The 
principal rivers are the Ztrmagnaj the CeUinay the JfarentOy and the Kerka. On the latter 
river, the whole course of which is 60 miles, are several fine cascades. There are numerous 
lakes wen stored with fish. The whole coast is indented with creeks and bays, and skirted by 
a great number of islands. The bay of Cattaro forms the best harbor in the Adriatic. 
The climate of Dalmatia is very mild, and, on the whole, like that of the south of Italy ;

but the mnnfaes oa the coaat render the air insalubriouB. Sdow amd frost are almost uokiiom 
ta the valieys. The winter is reiny- The soil is mostly calcareous, dry, and barren, and but 
m few places fit for cultivation. This country has quarnes of marble and fffsum, and nuoei 
of iroD-stooe. Wolves are found in the forest, and locusts occasionally infest the cowiry, 
Zarut the capital) is built on a neck of land separated from the continent by a deep ditch. Ii 
has two seminaries, a theatre, and a good harbor. Population, 7,400, SpaUUro is a fortified 
town with 9,000 inhabitants. Brazza, on an island of the Adriatic, produces a great quutil; 
of wine. RagKta was formerly distinguished for its trade and manufaclures, hut at presem 
contains but 6,000 inhabitants. Caitaro, on the gulf of the same name, is so surrounded and 
overhung by rocks, as for several hours in the day to be completely in their shade. It is veil 
fortified, and exports considerable wine and oil. 

Agriculture is very much neglected, but wheat, grapes, olives, figs, almonds, &c., are pro- 
duced in some abundance. A kind of coarse cloth is manu&ctured from the threads of broom, 
and employed m covering bales of merchandbe. In all the islands along the coast, fishing is i 
eonuoon occupation ; anchovies and mackerel are abundant. The population is about 310,000. 
The majofity of the inhabitants belong to the CathoUc and the United Church ; of the rest, 
61,164 are Greeks. Education is in a rude state. Dahnatia was oace subject to Venice, but, 
towards the end of the 15th ceotuiy, was seized by the Turks. lo 1707, it fell to the share 
of Austria, which in 1805 surrendered it to Napoleon. In 1613, the Austrians reconquered 
Dalmatia, and it now constitutes a part of their madtiine i>osse9sions.

ants wear a ealpac, or felt 
cap, and a large woolen 
cloak. They carry a wal- 
let on their shoulders, and 
generally bare a hatchet. 
Thus dressed and equip-, 
ped, they generally sleep, 
when traveling, in the open 
air. In Transylvania, the 
peasantry have nearly the 
ancient Romaii dress, that 
was worn by their class ; a. 
tunic of white cloth belted 
to the waist, end reaching to 
the knee ; trowsers in wide 
folds descending to the an-

most general is the Hus-

â€¢nd much public business is transacted in it. It does not, of course, retain all its classical 
parity among b people more given to arms than arts ; and the memofable shout of tbe Hun- 
nrian nobility, monamur pn regt nottro Maria Tlurtia^ bad more of heroism than latinity. 
Id Transylvania, as m Walhcbia, the koguage is a dialect of the Latin. 
There is fittle that u pecnliKr in Hungary ; the villages arÂ« composed of small houses, with 

ends to tbe street, and all, in 
point of shape, exactly alike. In 
TraDBylvania, it is common in 
some places ta have a homely 
sentiment written over the door ; 
as " May we never want bread, 
nor the freedom to enjoy our do- 
mestic comforts." 

Htn^oiy is blessed with abun- 
dance ; but commerce affords 
few outlets to her productions. 
In Dalmatia, on the contrary, 
some of the inhabitants at times 
are compelled, for several months 
in the year, to subsist on juniper 
berries, and wild roots. Frogs 
and snails are eaten in Hunga- 
ry ; and rice is common there,

of Hungary are excelleni ; some 
of tbe sweet wines are equal U the Monte Pulciano, and the Tokay is generally admitted to 
be die best wine in Europe. The grapes are not pressed, but the juice drips into vats from 
Rets suspended above. The true Tokay is produced but in a small district ; and it bears an 
coMmouB price. As its ezcallenca is mocb increased by age, it baa been sometimes sold for

The Tokay has in its favor ^^ infallible " testimony, for the Pope himself^ at the Council of 
Trent, was sustained by the council, in pronouncing it to be the best of wines. ConsideitUa 
quantities of rosoglio are consumed, and also of Maraschino, a cordial made of .acid cbeiries. 
These are made chiefly in Dalmatia, where there is dbtiUed also a spirituous liquor, from ths 
arbute tree. The Dalmatians are given to excess in the use of spirituous liquors. Tobacco n 
universally used in smoking, and as snuff. 

The chief maladies are gout, apd the diseases occasioned by exhalations from marshes. lo 
Lower Hungary, epidemic dborders are not uncommon. 

. In Hungary there are inns, but they afibrd little beside shelter ; and the traveler has frequent- 
ly to purchase his provisions at the large towns. The post coaches are often but carts, and 
generally the facilities for traveling are few. 

The Hungarians are distinguished for a military spirit, but they are social and hospitable, 
though proud and irritable. The two great pursuits are agriculture and arms, and there are few 
trades. In a people so variously compounded, or rather in a country with so many distinet 
races, the character and customs must be various.* Hungary may be considered the home of 
the Gypsies, but even here, that singular race have the same restless, wandering disposition, thu 
distinguishes them elsewhere. They are the traveling tinkers and musicians ; and when tbey 
have a settled or temporary residence, it is, in summer, a cave or a tent, and in winter, a hk 
like the den of a wild beast, from which light is excluded. The most usual trades followed hj 
the Gypsies, are those of black and white-smiths, though they act as farriers, carpenters, aod 
turners. They are universally the executioners and hangmen. The Transylvanian chuacter 
is not widely difierent from the Hungarian, though less national, and the manner of life approach- 
es more to that of the orientak. In describing the character of the various people composing 
the Austrian empire, geographers have seldom attempted to give any but the most general 
views. There are more athletic amusements than in Austria, and dancing is equally commoo, 
though with a greater variety of modes. Combats of animals, hunting, and the usual Europeaa 
games are common. In H!ungary the peasants who cultivate the eartb are by no means enbgfat* 
ened. More of them, however, can read and write than those of the same class in some parts 
of Germany ; and the schoob are sufliciendy numerous to scatter more knowledge. The 
Catholics have 3,561 teachers, 1 university, and several colleges. The united Greeks aod Ar* 
menians have 382 schools ; the Greeks, 1 ,226 schook and 2 gymnasiums ; the Calvinbts, 
1,600 teachers and 3 colleges ; the Lutherans, 1 lyceum, 1 college, and 629 teachers, and the 
Jews 100 teachers. There are, besides, agricultural schools and schools of industry. 

The arts are not successfully cultivated except music. The national music, however, is 
practised almost exclusively by die Gvpsies, who have produced several eminent artists in this 
department. Oeser, the painter, and Mind, the Raphael of cati^ were natives of Hungary. 



* 

* Â« The Hungarian inoonteitibi? ponenet the most 
fierj temper, and is completely qoalined both for uncom- 
monly ff(N>d and bad actions. The Slowack it much cool- 
er, ana ttill more so the German ; then follows the Wal- 
laehian and Servian, and last of all, the Rut]penian. The 
poor Jew is totally destitute of courage, and may be fright- 
ened with an empty meal-sack beyond the Uarpathian 
mountains. The Hungarian soon forgets injuries, the Ger- 
man later, but the Slowack and Wallachian, never. The 
Ruthenian is continually quarreling, the Jew is for ever 
involved in lawsuits, but is ready to be reconciled, as soon 
as danger threatens his fkmily or one of his nation. The 
Blagyar b proud* of being mounted on a fine horse ; the 
Slowack, when he is permitted to converse rather &mil- 
iarty with people of high rank ; the German, when he may 
oanr a cane in his mind (as judge of his village) ; the 
Wallachian, when he can eihibit a shining hatchet; the 
Ruthenian, when he is admitted to the hÂ»nor of clerical 
orders ; the Jew, when he has got farmers on his rent-roll ; 
and the Gypsy, when be is dressed in scarlet breeches. 
When the Macjar is in liquor, he is melancholy, nay , even 
careless of his life ; the Slowack pretends to be witty ; the 
German is talkative and very tiresome ; the Wallacnian is 
quarrelsome, and read^ to shed blood ; the Ruthenian 
mutters inwardly, and is reserved and prone to revenge. 
When the Magyar or Slowack is going to cheat a person, 
k$ praieei him ; the German oSsn him Us â– trvioefl; tht 



Wallachian protests to be bis friend ; the Rutheniaa Â§apt 
to be stupid ; the Servian is submissive ; the Jew promiM 
mountains of gold ; the Gypsy jokes. Whenever & Q^ 
rel arises, the German screams and threatens ; the Orott 
swears and curses ; the Ruthenian spits at his adyentrjr, 
and seizes him by his hair ; the Slowack makes use of M 
fists, and boxes his enemy ; the Magyar cudgels him till 
blood begins to flow ; the Gypsy assails his face with hi* 
nails ; Um Wallachian strives to strike him dead, and the 
Jew screams and takes to his heels. "When the Mtptr 
swears, he always takes God to witness, while the Siov- 
ack calls upon the devil to take him. The cnrsin| Utt 
yar, Wallachian, and Servian use an immense vanety of 
abusive names ; the Slowack hurls a thousand tbQIlde^ 
bolts at hb opponent, and the German ever calls the dev- 
il to his aid. The Magyar preferably appropriates to hin- 
self, without paying for it, (i. e. steals,) cattle, especiaUj 
horses, then oxen ; the Slowack, eatables ; the Sclavonittt 
iron and leather utensils; the Wallachian, money; tM

HMrtture of Hungsuy has added little or nothing to the general stock of European taste or 
kiMiiwledge. In Hungary there is no established religion, according to the letter of the lavr , but 
tbe Catholics are the most numerous sect. There are Lutherans, Calvinists, Jews, and others 
The Ojpsies are without a creed. The Jews pay a tax called tolerance. In Transylvania, 
i bwo are Oreeks, Catholics, various sects of Protestants, Jews, and Unitarians. 

In Transylvania, as in other districts in that vicinity, there is a belief in vampyres, oi 
of demons, that animate the bodies of the dead, which come forth to steal away the life of 
the living, by sucking their blood. The victims are often supposed to be the nearest friends 
of the deceased. It used to be the custom, when a vampyre was supposed to be the ten- 
mC of a particular new-made grave, to open it, and examine the corpse ; if this was found 
with ruddy cheeks, and fresh and undecayed, it was adjudged a vampyre and burnt. The 
Wallachian population, to show affection for their departed friends, moisten their graves with 
wine. They have also the custom, which prevails in many countries, of interrogating tbe dead ; 
sqring to a deceased friend, that he was so fortunately situated with his wife, children, and 
frieiMls, that he should not have died. They say to him that he acted foolishly, and call upon 
him to change his mind. Hungary is an hereditary monarchy. The king has great power, but 
there is a Diet, which has its influence in the State. In religious matters, the king has papal 
aothority. Transylvania b a limited monarchy ; and the king, like the king of Hungary, is the 
Eosperor of Austria. 

Hungary, or Pannonia, as it was called by the Romans, was mvaded and subdued by the 
Bfi^ars, a Caucasian tribe, towards the end of the 9th century ; about which time Christiani- 
tf was iotroduced. The kincdom was especially aggrandized during the administration of Mat- 
tUas, who took possession of Vienna and many of the neighboring provinces, and died m 1490. 
Alter his death Austria recovered the conquered provinces, and began to look to the prospect 
of soecession to the Hm^rian crovm.' In 1526, the greater part of Hungary was conquered 
by tbe Turks, m whose hinds it remained until the peace of Carlowitz, in 1699. From this 
period tbe country has remained united to the Austrian Empire.' 

CHAPTER XXIV. GERMAN AND POLISH PROVINCES OF AUSTRIA. 

J}i9i$ian$. This jpart of the Austrian Empire consists of 1. the Archduchy of Austria ; 
3. the Duchy of Stiria ; 3. the Kingdom of lllyria ; 4. the Tyrol ; 5. the Kinedom of Bo- 
hemia ; 6. the Margraviate of Moravia and Austrian Silesia ; 7. the Km^dom of Galicia. 

1. Archduchy of Auriria. This country b bounded north by Bohemia and Moravia, east 
by Hungary, south by Stiria, and west bv Bavaria. It contains 15,000 square miles, and a 
popdation of 2,400,000. It lies upon tne Danube, which rises in Bavaria and flows easterly 
into Hungary. The Enns, one of its branches, divides the country into Upper and Lower 
Austria. A branch of the Noric Alps, called the Soemmering Heights, sepa^tites it from 
Stiria. Another range, called the KaJuenbei^, extends from the source of the Drave toward 
tbe Danube. Other eminences, of considerable elevation, are scattered over tiie country. 
The rivers vary in color at different seasons, except the Danube, which is always yellow. The 
others are of a beautiful lively green in the spring. The lake of Gmunden is celebrated for 
tbe fine scenery of its shores, and the salt manufactured from its waters and the nerghborhood, 
which supplies the whole of Austria. There are many other lakes. The climate on the 
mountainous borders of Stiria and Bohemia, is cold, with boisterous winds and a short sum- 
mer ; the ground is covered with snow from October to March. On the banks of the Danube 
tbe heat of summer and autumn b excessive. The soil is generally good. Upper Austria 
abounds in fossil salt. 

Vtennoj the capital, is pleasantly situated upon the Danube, in tbe midst of a fertile and 
picturesque region. It consists of the city proper, which is small and surrounded with walls, 
and 34 suburj^, whose spacious streets and elegant edifices form a striking contrast with the 
narrow streets and mean buildings of the former. Vienna contains 18 public squares, 20 mo- 
nasteries, 5 theatres, 50 churches, numerous scientific and charitable institutions, palaces, ftc, 
and 430,000 inhabitants. The finest promenade is the Prater, on an island in the Danube, 
iriiich the rich equipages, the gay crowd, the fine walks, and the various amusements combine 
to rouler unrivaled in Europe. The imperial palace is a splendid, but urregular building, con- 
numerous treasures of art, and a fine library of 300,000 volumes.

any similar asubiishroents. Pleasure ia the great occupation of 
tbe inhabitants of Vienna. In tbe environs are numerous parks, 
and pret^ towns. Schoenbrumi and Luxemburg are favorite sum- 
mer residences of the emperor. 

Other towns in tbe Archduchy of Aiiatria are Mhtstadty coo- 
tainiDglSjOOOiofaabitaBts, with flounsbing msBuliKtures, and con- 
nected with Vienna hy Â» canal ; lAnix, with 25,000, contaiiiin^ 
extensive woolen manufactures, and connected with the salt works 
of Gmunden by a railroad ; Stntr, 10,000 inhabitants, noted for 
the excellence and cheapness of its culleiy, which is exported to 
all parts of Europe, and Saltzbarg, with 14,000 inhabitants, nitb 
a cathedral, archnishop's palace, several literary institutions, and 
mannfadures. 

Agriculture is generally well managed. Wheat, barley, oats, 
rye, peas. lie. are cultivated. In Lower Austria the vine is ex- 
tensively cultivated Manu&ctures aFÂ» pretty active, and VieniM 
employs 80,000 arti6cers b different febrics. The chief articles 
are woolen, colton, silh, leather, iroD> stee), glass, porcelain, pa- 
per, toys, and furniture. A railroad extends from Mauthausen oo 
Firenumof V '''* Danube to Budweis on tbe Moldau, 70 mileg in length, tbas 

connecting tbe Elbe with the Danube. Another great project bas 
received the approbation of tbe Austrian and Russian gov-enMnems ; 
it contemplates the connexion of Vienna with Warsaw, in Poland, 
by a railroad. The Vienna canal extends from Vienna to Neu- 
sudt, 40 miles, and it is proposed to continue it to Trieste. 

3. Dnchy of Stiria. This province is bounded north by Aus- 
tria, east by Hungary and Croatia, south by Csmiota, and west by 
Carinthia and Upper Austria. It is 125 miles in length and 70 in 
breadth. It is divided into Upper and Lower Stiria, and contains 
8,380 square miles, and a million inhabitants. Upper Stiria a mono- 
lainous ; many of its elevations are of graat height. Louer Stiria 
â– 3 more level. The rivers flow into the Danube sod Drave. The 
level parts are fertile ; cattle arc pastured upon tbe mountains, an^ 
these prions abound in wild animals. Atinerals are abundant, as 
iron, silver, lead, and copper ; the iron mines of Eiseaarz and Vor- 
derbei^ are very productive. Fossil salt is also found here. Hot 
batbs and medicinal springs are common lo Lower Stiria. Grattz, 
a well-built town, and the capital of Stiria, contains a university, 
i with a rich library, and numerous odier institutions for education, 
among which the JobanneUiB^ or college founded by the Archduke 
Atiritn (PomM. John, IS the principal. Its maflufactures of cotton goods, bant 

ware, silk, Slc, are extensive. Population, 50,000.

S. MBngdtm ef lUyria. This kiagdoin is bounded north by Ajnstrm^ and Slim, etsC bj 
Croatta, south hj the Adriatic, west by the Lombardo-Venetian Kingdom and Tyrol. It con* 
cams 11,000 square miles, and 1,357,000 inhabitants. The country is mountainous ; the |^cks 
consist of priipitiye limestone, fadlowed out into a vast number of grottoes. There are said to 
be 1,000 cares m Illyria, amone which that oVMtUitrg b celebrated fbr its dimensions and 
crjstab. It b thought the whofe ridge of mountains intersectbg the country is hollow ; many 
rirers sink into the ground and appear in other phces among them. The Sdve, Laybacli, 
Chtrckj and bonzo^ water different parts of the kingdom. The lake of ZirkniUz is a great cuÂ« 
rios|^ ; it b 8 miles long, 4 broad, and is completely surrounded by steep mountains and for- 
ests. In June its waters entirely disappear, through holes in the bottom of the lake, which is 
then ploughed and sown. In 3 months' time, an abundant crop of hay and millet b produced r 
the deer come down from the mountains and feed in the pastures. In September, the waters 
rush violently back, and fill the lake ; it then abounds m fish. The waters have been known 
to fluctuate 3 dmes a year, and in other seasons not at all. The climate in the mountains is 
rtgorooe but healthy. On the coast it is warm, and vegetation is luxuriant. In other parts the 
vine and o&ve flourish. Minerals are abundant. Iron, lead, and copper are exportea. The 
quicksilver mmes of Idria are the richest in Europe, and yield annually 640,000 pounds of 
quicksilver, and 378,000 pounds of cmnabar. 

lU^a consists of 2 political divisions, the government of Laybaeb, including Carinthia and 
Camioh, and the eovemraent of Trieste, comprising Istria ; these are subdivided into 7 circles. 

7VieÂ«fe, situated upon the northern extremity of the Gulf of Venice, b the principal com- 
mercial town in the emphraÂ« Including the immediate neighborhood, with its beautiful gardens, 
vineyards, and country seats, it has a population of 76,000 souls. The commerce of Trieste 
has nmidly bcreased since it has been declared a firee port. In the vicinity is Aqailtia^ now 
m small viflage, once the centre of commerce between the northern and southern parts of the 
Roman empire, and a large city with 100,000 inhabitants. 

Laybachy formerly 'capital of the duchy of Camiola, and at present of the kingdom of IDy- 
ria, has an active trade^ and its manufactures are extensive. A congress of European sover- 
eigns was held here in 1820. Population, 19,000. /dm, in the same government, derives 
importance firom its rich mines of quicksilver. Population, 5,000. Clagenfurthj a busy man- 
dacturing town, with 13,000 mhabitants, was the capital of the former duchy of Carindiia; 
Ibmgnoy with a good harbor, has an active commerce, and contains 10,000 inhabitants. 

One of the most perfect and extensive works of the Romans is at Pola, about 40 miles from 
Trieste. It is an amphitheatre, with 3 floors and rustic arcades. In height it is 97 feet, and 
in length 416. The seats occupy but one side, and are formed on the declivity of a bill. It 
is mitire in its whole circuit, and is capable of accommodating 18,000 persons. The chief 
productions of Illyria arise from the minerals above mentioned, the cultivation of the vine and 
ofive, add fishing of anchovies in the Adriatic. 

4. Tlie Tyrol This district is bounded north by Bavarfa, east by Austria, south by the 
Lombardo-Venetian Kingdom, and west by Switzerland. It contains 10,880 square miles, 
and 900,000 inhabitants. It is very mountainous and much resembles Switzerland, being 
traversed by the Rhetian Jllps^ some of whose summits belong to the highest European moun- 
tains. The Ortlerspitz reaches the height of 12,800 feet. There is a lower chain called the 
Brenner^ or Burning Mountain, from its glaciers, which appear in the sunshine like a blaze of 
light. Many of the ridges are crowned with sharp pinnacles of granite, resembling obelisks ; 
some are rent into deep and frightful chasms, and others covered with eternal snow. Numer- 
ous mountain torrents water the country, and find their way to the Rhine, Danube, Po, and the 
Adriatic. The largest river is the Inn^ which rises m the canton of the Grbons in Switzerland, 
md receiving numeroua mountain streams in that country, falls into the Danube at Passau. 
The Adige rises in this country and passes through the Venetian territory into the Adriatic. 
The Drave^ Lechj Iser^ and IlUr rise in this country. 

The mountains have the climate of Switzerland ; the snow and toirents Uock up the vilhtges, 
and confine the inhabitants within doors in winter. The soil produces hemp, flax, tobacco, 
and grain ; the vine is reared in some parts. There are rich mines of silver, lead, copper, 
iron, and salt ; precious stones to a considerable amount are obtained here, as a^tes, comeli* 
ans, rubies, amethysts, emeralds, and chalcedonies. The inhabitants are industrious, and, beÂ« 
ndes the occupation of hunting and agriculture, employ themselves m manufacturing boxes, 
cases of instruments, toys, fcc., which are exported even to America. The rearing of canaÂ«

waters, are the other most important Bohemiaa towns. 

The agricultural products are buckwheat, millet, pulse, saSron, ginger, &c., but hops are 
the staple article, and their excelleace is unsurpassed. The vine is cultivated, but to no great 
extent. Manufactures are flourishing, and comprise linen thread, and cloth, lace, ribands, silk, 
paper, cotton cloth, stockings, gloves, leather, iron, brass, tin, cutlery, and jeweL-y. 

Bohemia was occupied by German tribes in the 4th century. An army of Sclavonians sub- 
dued the countiy in the 6th century. The first sovereign known by name was Przemislas, a 
peasant, whom the princess Libusaa married in 633, and raised to the throne. The sovereigns 
were at first called dukes, but the title of king was granted in 1061, by the Emperor Heniy 
the Tenth. Bohemia was united to the German empire in 1310, but separated from it in the 
next century. In the I7lh century it became an appendage to the Austrian monarchy. 

6. JUargranttit o/ JtSoraeia and â€¢Stttlriait Silena. These provinces are bounded north by 

Bohemia and Prussian Silesia, east by Hungai^ and Galicia, 
south by Austria, and west by Bohemia. They contain 
10,100 square miles, and 2,300,000 inhabitants. Half the 
country is covered with mountains and forests. In the level 
parts are bogs, lakes, and morasses. A number of smaD 
streams here unite and form the Morava, which flows into 
the Danube. In the mountainous parts, the climate is so cold, 
that stoves are used all the year ; yet the air Is salubrious. 
Game and venJson are plentiful, atid the country had once 
mines of gold, which are now exbausled. 

jBrunn, the capital of Moravia, has a citadel on an emi- 
nence 806 feet bigb. The city is well built, and the pub- 
lic edifices are splendid. Population, 42,000. Olmutx, 
with 18,000 inhabitants, is noted as the prison of Lafayette. 
The village of â€¢Smterliti^ is 12 miles from Brunn, and is 
celebrated for one of Napoleon's greatest victories. TVop- 
pau, in Silesia, has 14,000 inhabitants, and is famous for a 
pongress held here, in 1830. The inhabitants raise corn 
sufficient for their own subsistence and for exportation. 
Hemp, flax, fruits, and vegetables, are also largely culti- 
vated. Moravia was part of a great kingdom partitioned, in 
the lOlh century, by the surrounding powers. Since the 
llth century, it has been for the most of the lime attached 
Pausni Iff Mamim. to Bohemia. Silesia is a part of the duchy of that name, 

the most of which was assigned to Prussia, in 1742. 

7. Siit^om of Galicia, This country is bounded north by the republic of Cracow and the 

kingdom of Poland, east by Russia, 
and south and west by the Hungarian 
Slates. It contains S3, 000 square 
miles, and 4,950,000 inhabitants. The 
Crapack or Carpathian Moutitaitu 
divide it from Hungary, and send off 
several branches into this country, but 
the greater part declines gradually from 
the highlands into an immense plain. 

The Dnieiter rises on the north of 
the mountains, and passes southeast- 
erly into Russia. The Pruth also 
I rises here, and flows in the same 

J direction. The head streams of the 

I Vistula and Bug water the north- 

em and western parts. The soil in 
the north and west is only moderately 



fattilfl, and m some parts manhjr ; in tbe east iDii soodi, it u higfaljr prodiie^Â«. In ibe (le> 
partmeot of minerals, this region is distinguished for its fossil salt. The mines of Widicib 
Sre the most celebrated in the world. Tbey extend above a mile under ground, and are be- 
tween 700 and 600 feet in depth.' They employ 900 miners, and yield annually 300,000 cwt. 
of salt. There are also mines of ulver, iron, copper, lead, and sulphur. 

Lemberg, the capital of Austrian Poland, or the Kingdom of Galicia, is a lat^e and well-biA 
city, with a population of 75,000 souls, among whom are 20,000 Jews. It contains a uni- 
versity esd other literary instituUons, and is the residence of iloman Catholic, Armenian, kA 
Greek archbishops, and of a superior Rabbi. Its woolen and cotton manufactures are im- 
portant, and it carries on ao active trade with Russia, Turkey, &c. Brody, the second dtj, 
and tbe most important commercial town of Galicia, has 25,000 inhabitants, of whom 20,OOQ 
are Jews. Jaroalao has some manufactures belonging to the government. Population, 9,000. 
Bochnia has salt mines, furnishing nearly 350,000 cwt. of salt. Population, 6,100. 

Agriculture is much neglected. The articles cultivated are com, 6ax, tobacco, and vegeta- 
bles. The forests furnish abundance of wood and potash. The Jews commonly buy tbe Imi- 
vest of the farmer while growing in the field. The manufacttues consist of broadcloth ud 
cordage. There is little trade except in tbe natural productions of the country. Galicia fomed 
Â« part of the ancient kingdom of Poland, and was acquired by Austria at tbe partitioning of tbu 
country, as related in the history of Poland.

maladies that prevail in the middle latitudes of Europe. The expense of trateting hf 
B equal to tbat in France, but the inns, roads, and vehicles are bad ; the system o^ paas* 
( and cusCDm-houses is very strict and annoying. 
ttbe Austrians are more cheerful and affable thm the Germans, and their capital is oekHirated 

for its splendor and various amusements. The higher <$lasses 
are fond of show. Quarrels are rare, and years pass wicbobt 
the occurrence of a capital execution. The peme ate, of 
course, distinguished for self-H^ommand and an even teofperft- 
ment. Tbe Austrians are ingenious in mechanism ; but lhâ‚¬4r 
greatest efforts in this way are not of practical utility. Auto- 
maton chess-players, ancl a head imitating the sounds of the 
human voice, are Austrian inventions. In the United 4ftttieB 
Mid in Great Britain, the same mechanical turn of mind Js do- 
voted to projects of general utility, and adds new iaciKties io 
science, commerce, and manufactures. It has been noied Â«f 
the Austrians, tbat they take no interest in public afilm, and 
seldom converse upon them. From the time of Maria Theresa, 
however, mih few intervals, it has been the care of tbe gov- 
ernment to prevent the subjects from speculating too curiously 
upon the right and the expedient in politics ; and the leasofi 
why the Austrians do not now converse on public afiairs, is 
that they are not permitted to feel that interest which comes 
from taking a part in them. The Austrians have been called 
sensual ; and it is certain, that they are more fond of Ihe 
pleasures of tbe table than the other Germans. 

The Tyrolese are hardy, brave, and of great simplietty Of

the distinctions of wealth or rank, and defending their rude mountains with a courage aind cof>* 
stancy seldom found in a people dwelling on the roost fertile plains. They are devout Catho- 
lics, but too kind to be intolerant. Their country is too barren to support them by agriculture 
alone, though this is followed with great skill and perseverance. Many breed canary birds, and 
wander into foreign countries to sell them. Almost every one is an artisan or manufacturer.

oecasion to compare it to the suppoaed magnificence of

oat the salt, lor the purpose of keeping up ihe roof, there 
ia a vast variety of others, grotesque and finely figured, 
the work of nature ; and these are generally of the purest 
uid brightest salts. The roofii of the arches are, in many 
plaors, itforned with salt, hanging from the top in form of 
wieles, and having all the hues and colors of the rainbow. 
TW walks are covered with various congelations of the 
sMBe kind; and the very floors, when not too much 
trodden and baUered, are eovered with globules of the 
sane sort of ma^srials.

In various parts of this spacious plain, stand the huts 
of the minerfeand families, some single, and others in dus- 
ters, like villages. They have very little communication 
with the world above ground, and many hundreds of peo- 
ple are bom and live all their lives there. Throu^ the 
midst of this plain lies a road, which is always filled with 
carriages, loaded with masses of salt out of tfcle further part 
of the mine^ and carrying them to the place where the 
rope belonging to the wheel receives them; the drivers of 
these carnages are all merry and singing, and the salt 
looks like a load of gems. A great number of horses an 
kent here, and, when once let down, they never see day* 
lignt again ; bnt some of the men take frequent oocasioas 
of going npi and breathing the firesh air. 



Tbey" execute many woifa in wood villi great neatnest. Shops and bomes' m fnBMd,&i 
pieces numbered, and transported to the lake of Constance, and from tbence to different couh 
tries. Many of the Tyroleae follow the advcDlurous life of hunters, but all these employmeoti 
are insufficient to support the population, and it is supposed, that 30,000 leave the counD; 
yearly. At six years of age, the Tyrolian often quits his country, and sets out for a &ir in Bi- 
raria, where he gets eraployraeot in herding geese or cattle. 

The Bohemiaas are hardy and cheerful ; they have great musical talents, and are found tt 
musicians all over Germany ; they have a disposition to travel, and visit in all countries, thoi^ 
tbey often return to their own. They are inclined to superstition, and in no place is the reve- 
rence to the images of saints carried so far as in Prague ; the hiidge is lined with an avenue of 
statues, round which numerous people kneel, or prostrate themselves, in the most humble [mÂ» 
lures. The peasantry have the usual faults that spring from an unequal condition ; for ctaj 
landholder is a master, and every peasant in effect a slave. 

Austria has many schools, of every grade ; hut all are public ; and of course the institutJODi 
are not so well conducted as in couutries where rival institutions are permitted in competitioo. 
The higher classes are intelligent, especially at Vieooa ; and, of the people at large, the grealcr 
part can read and write. There are universities at Vienna, Prague, and Pest, and lyceumsil 
several towns. There is a medical school at Vienna, and ao academy for painting, sculpiure, 
architecture, and engraving. The Austrian States have not added much to the literature of 
Europe, nor have any of the departments of science been much advanced by them. Tin 
present emperor is known to make a distinction between good scholars and good subjects. Tlu 
art! of sc&Ipture, painting, and even architecture, are in a humble state, but that of music it 
moie generally and successfully cultivated than in any other country. Haydn and Mozart m 
names associated with harmony. 

The Catholic is the eslablisned religion of Austria, but all others are tolerated. There ue, 
besides Catholics, Lutherans, Calvinists, Jews, &c. In Bohemia, many of the ecclenastics 
are said to be dissolute. Austria is en absolute monarchy, in which the power of the crowD is 
impregnable. The censorship of the press is strict, travelers are subjected to annoyance, aod 
all means are taken to secure the dependence of the people on the government, and to prevent 
all innovation or discussion of political institutions. Bohemia, as well as Hungary, is a distioci 
kingdom, and limited monarchy, but under the immediate government of the emperor. In llie 
Tyrol, the four estates, including the peasantry, are convened to grant supplies for the expenses 
orgovemment. The laws in Austria are mild, and the administration of them just. The cliil 
code, introduced in 1811, is considered good. 

8. Hittory. Austria began to acquire significance in the I2th century, when it was mxlei 
duchy. In the fallowing century, the house of Hapsbui^ laid the foundation of the Austrin 
greatness. New territories were subsequently acquired, and the electoral crown of Genasaj 
was obtained by this dynasty in 1438. Austria was ra-.sed to an arebducby in 1453, and, viib 
the acquisition of Bohemia and Hungary, in 1526, it was allowed the rank of a European mon- 
â– rcby. It was erected into an empire in 1804, and though much abridged of its territory and 
induence, by the conquests of Napoleon, its losses were subsequently reurleved, and it is doTi 
both in name and effect, one of the chief powers of Europe. 



CHAPTER XCV. PRUSSIA. 



I. Jtowidmriei md Extent. Tbis kingdom is composed of two dnUact portions of tmriloiy, 
â€¢eptirated hy the German States. They are bounded north by the Netherlands, HaoOTer,' 
Mecklenburg, and the Baltic Sea ; east by Russia and Poland ; south by Austria, Saxony, 
several of the German States ; and west by the Netherlands. The northern extremity is in 
&5^ 46% and the southern in 49Â° north latitude. Tbe eastern extremity is in 23Â°, and the 
western in 6Â° east longitude. The eastern division contains 88,200, and the western 18,100 
square miles ; total, 106,300.* 

3k Mounlaini. Some parts of the eastern division are skirted by the Hartz and Svietie 
mountains. In the western part, there are some ranges of hills ; but in general, the conntry ia 
not mountainous. 

3. Riverg, The Oder nses in Moravia and flows through the whole of eastern and south- 
em Prussia northwesterly into the Baltic ; it is 460 miles long, and for the most part is navi- 
gable. The Elbe enters Prussia from Saxony, and flows northwesterly into Hanover. Tbe 
Spree, SaaU, Havel^ and EUter, are tributaries of tbe Elbe. The Preget, J^Tiemen, and FU- 
ttiia, water the northeastern pan. The western part is traversed from southeast to northwest 
by the Rhine, 

4. Coatt and Bayt. Prussia has 500 miles of coast upon tbe Baltic, comprising two lane 
bMs, tbe Gulf of Dantzic, and the Gulf of Rugen, and three Hafft, or Gulfs ; the KariiMt 
Haff, which receives the Nieman ; the Frische Haff, at the mouth of the Vistula ; and tbe 
Stettin Haff, at the mouth of the Oder. 

5. hlandi. On the coast of Fomerania, on the Baltic, is the island of Rtigeny tbe largest 
belonging to Germany. It contains 370 square miles, and is partly covered with a forest of 
beech trees. Many parts of it are fertile. It has 28,150 iohabitsnts. The chief town is 
Bergtn, with a population of 2,200. Several small islands are scattered around it. 

6. Climate. The climate is temperate and healthy in general, though varying much in the 
different provinces. Along the Baltic it is cold, damp, and variable. In the interior it is 
much more agreeable. 

7. Soil. In the eastern part there is little fertile land, except strips of low marshy temtoiy 
along the coast and rivers. The remainder is sandy and overerown with heath. In the west- 
ern part the soil is much superior ; yet here are many tracts that are stopy and tmproductiv*. 

8. J^^nerali. The mountainous parts contain iron, copper, lead, and silver. Salt is ob- 
tained from springs in Prussian Saxony. Eastern Prussia is the only country of Europe which 
[ffoduces in any abundance the remarkable substance called amber ; naturalists are yet ignorant 
of its origin, and it is uncertain whether it should be ranked among vegetable, mineral, or ani- 
mal productions. It is found on the shores of the Baltic, thrown upon the beach by tbe stroiw 
northeasterly gales. Sometimes it is found in sand-hills near the sea, in regular strata, winch 
â– re worked as in a tnme. It is also found in the interior, but m small iÂ»eces, and to a trifling

heyoad Pobogeu. About 300 tool ara prodiieed vnually, yieldiog a revenue of 32,000 dol- 
hn to the king. 

9. I^tce of the Cowttry. The eastara part u an immense plain, so Sat tovnrdi tbe sn, 
diat the coast would be exposed to inundation were it not protected by downs of sand. Ths 
livers bare so little descent to canr off tfaeir waters, that they run into stagnant lakes. Tha 
western part is somewhat hilly. Forests of great extent exist in both divisions. 

10. Oittuiom. The Prussian monarchy is divided into 8 provinces, which are subdivided 
into 25 governments and 328 ch-cles. Two of tbe provinces are in the western, and tbe n- 
mainder in tbe eastern section. 

Provincei of Eattam Pnuria, Pomerania, 

Prussia, Brandenburg. 

Grand Duchy of PoMb, Provinces of }Feitem Pnurio. 

Saxony, Westphalia, 

Silesia, Rhine. 

11. Canqlt. . The Bromberg Canal coooeots the Brahe, a tributary of the Vistula, mib 
tbe Netze, a tributary of tbe Oder; 16 miles long. The Frederictrilliam Catial uniies 
ibe Oder above Frankfort with the Spree, and the Platun Canal connects tbe Elbe and the 
Hiral. Then are some other caoaB, but, as well as those above mentioned, they are of w 
-graM extent. 

Tvmnt. BtrKn, the c^iital, situated in the midst of a sandy plain upon the Spree, ta 
city, with apaoious and regular streets, adorned with several fine squares and mtaj 
elegant edi&ces. The Royal pal- 
ace is one of tbe most migniBcent 
in Europe, and the arsenal is one 
of the largest in the world. Sev- 
eral palaces of the royal princes 
and of the nobility, and many pub- 
lic edifices and churches, are (ho 
handsome buildings. Some of the 
22 squares are adorned with stat- 
ues or other monuments, and Lime- 
street, planted with 6 ions of lime 
trees, is one of the roost beauliTuI 
streets in Europe. There is t 
great number of literary inttituiicDi 
and scientific estabUsbmenls, whicli 
are of a high order. The univer- 
sity, with its beautiful halls and ei- 

cellent collecliona, is perbaps equal 

to any in the world ; and there ire 
9 ooUefes, 7 gymnasiumsi and other higher schoob, with upward of 100 elernentary scbools- 
The Zoological Garden is a favorite promenade ; and the Farade^ound is an extensive Geld, 
used for military reviews. Population, 340,000 in 1848.

town, with 18,000 inhabitants. Briilau, upon the Oder, capital of Silesia, is officially styled 
the third capital of tbe kingdom. Its university, with numerous scientific institutions and a vil- 
uaUe library, the extent of Its commerce and manuCtctures, and its population, amounting lo 
' 113.000touls, render it the second city in Pnusia. 

PoMti is a large and flourishing city upon the Wartha. It is strongly fortified, and its three

mi Xanten, interesting from its magnificent catbednl and nomerous antiquities, are alu a ibk 
lection of the country. 

13. .SgricuUure. In much of the eastern section, the implements of husbandry are nide, 
nd agriculture is in a backward condition ; but in the western section, much of the coimtry ia 
AilTulIy cultivated. Tbe raising of cattle and sheep is the emjdoyment of many of tbe iabaU* 
itDts ; the rine is cultivated along tbe Rhine. 

14. Jtfanvfacturtt. The principal articles of manufacturing industry are woolen, linen, and 
cotton goods, and hardware. Silesia and the Rhenish governments are the most extensively 
ncaeed m this branch of industry. Iron and steel wares are made largely at Berlin, Solingen 
ana Iseriohn. The printing-presses of Berlin and Halle are numerous and productive. 

13. Commerce. Prussia has little maritime commerce, and but a small commercial, and no 
Buliiary marine. Corn, provisions, cattle, the Silesian Knens, the Rhenish aid Moadk wkies, 
Ae Westphaltan hams, and amber and metallic ornaments, are die chief exports. OokKiid br 
India goods form the bulk of the imports. The inland trade is more extensive. 

16. Religion. Perfect religions freedom exists in Prussia. Three fiftlis of ibe inhabitants 
befong to the Evangelical or United Lutheran-Calvinist church. There Is a ProtesCant apcb 
bishop of Koenigsberg, and there are bishops of Berfin, Stettin, and Potstkm. The Caibofici 
Ire most numerous In the provinces of Posen, Westphatm, And tlie Rhine. Thart Â»e two 
CaihoUc archhi^ops, of Cologne and Poscn, and six Di^pt 



310' GnUJMT. 

17. Education. There are sit onirerBities id PruHia, at Beiiio, Hdls, Bieilu, Boati, 
Koenigsberg, and Greirsiralde. Those of Berlin, Halle, and Boaa rank among the mosl ex- 
cellent inslitutions of the kind in Europe. The next JHTerior d^ee of education, called th> 
Becondaiy education, is Uberalljr provided for by numerous and excellent institutions, such M 
gymnasiums or classical schools, Real-schuleo or schools for iostniction in mathematics, sciencei, 
&c. Elementaiy education is afforded by upwards of 32,000 common or primary schools, to 
which all the subjects are required by law to send th^ children, after tbey reach a certain sge. 
On the whole, there is no country where the system of puUic education is so exteosive mi 
complete as in Prussia. 

13. Government. Army. The Eoremment is an absolute monarchy ; the revenue is tboot 
35 millions of dollars ; the public debt, 140 millions. The militaiy is composed of the leguhr 
troops and the militia or landwehr ; the former amounts to 162,000 men ; the latter to 360,000. 
Every subject is required to serve three years in the standing army, between the 17th and 33d 
years of his age, with the exception of those who hare received a certain education , these 
serr^ but 'one year. AOer this tÂ«m of service, every person belongs, till bis SOlfa year, to the 
first class of the landwehr, which is drilled every Sunday, and is in active Geld service for the 
apace of three weeks, once a year. The second class of landwehr, composed of those above 
SO, is exempt from further duty, except in war. Thus the whole natioD is essentially miliiuy, 
and Prussia has been called by a late traveler, " the classic land of barracks and schools." 
19. ItihahHatOt. FivÂ« sixths of the whole Prussian population are Germans. In the pro- 
vinces of Prussia and Posen, the Sclavonic race is numerous, 
comprisii^ Poles, Lithuanians, &c. The Wends, in the pro- 
vince of BraodenbuT^ are likewise Sclaronians. The Jews iie 
numerous in Posen, and there are some French on the weÂ«- 
em frontiers of the province of the Rhine. The Germans oi 
Prussia are industrious and orderly ; but, though welt educated, 
the lower orders are without that civil and political freedom, 
which alone can bring their knowledge and taleots into activity. 
' The Sclavonic nations are very much behind the Germans in 
the useful arts, intelligence, foresight, and the comforts of UTe ; 
and even when surrounded fay a German popuktion, obstinately 
adhere to their own langu^e and custome. Population of tbt 
kingdom, in 1843. 15,471,765, in 1850, 16,330,186. 

19. HUtory. The present kingdom of Prussia has beca 

. formed by various conquests, since the beginning of the ISth 

"""""*â–  century, when it first assumed the rank of a kingdom. Frederie 

William the First, who reigned from 1713 lo 1740, laid the foiuidatioD of the military power 

of Prussia. His son and successor, Frederic the Second, called the Great, augmented his (ei- 

ritory by the conquest of Silesia, and the partitioo of Poland, and left the kingdom with a bi^ 

Eolitical influence in Europe. The battle of Jena, in 1 806, threw the whole kingdom into the 
ands of Napoleon. From this time, it was little more than a depoidency tÂ£ the French em* 
pire, till the Russian campaign. After the fail of Napoleon, the kingdom was established upoa 
Its present foodi^, with great accessions of territory, and it is now the fifth of the great Euro- 
pean powers 



CHAPTER XXVI. GENERAL VIEW OF GERMANY. 

I. Botmdariet and Elxtent. The States of the German Confederacy are bounded north by 
the German Ocean, Denmark, and the Baltic Sea ; east by Prussia, Posen, Poland, CrwovJa, 
Galicia, Hungary, and lUyria ; south by Istria, the Adriatic Sea, the Lombardo- Venetian 
kingdom, and Switzerland ; and west by France, Holland, and Belgium. They extend from 
4&Â° to 64Â° 40^ north latitude, and from 4^ fiO' to 20Â° east lopgitude, and contain 246,000 
â€¢qoare miles, with about 42,000,000 inhabitants. 

The foltewing is a list of the States of the German Confederacy ; besides which, are the 
dnchies of Hobtein and Lauenburg, now belonging to Denmark ; the duchy of Luxemburg, 
belonging to the king of the Netherlands ; all the kingdom of Prussia except tlie Polish and

. Mowttaitu. Tlie Mpi exteod in several ranges throuKh the south of Gennaoy. The 
Â» Mpi proceed from the Grisoos and the Tyrol. The J^orie ^Ipi extend into the 
plum of Hungny. The Carpathian Mountaitu occupy a portion of the easiern parts. The 
Sfud^ie chain b a branch of these, exteuding westerly, and receiving, in different parts, the 
mows of the Biuengebirge, Erzgebtrge, Fichlelgebirge, and Thuringeruald. The Harit 
â€¢WraNtaMf are the most northerly, aod may be considered as a continuation of these last. Many 
parts of the Alps rise to the heixhi of perpetual snow. 

S. Fvruit. The great passion of the Germans for hunting the w 
ntnn why this country abounds so much in forests. The Hercynian 
tinÂ» Was nine days' journey in length, and six in breadth, is now di 
bear particular names. The mountains arc so generally clothed witb 
word void signifies both mountain and forest. Most of (he woods 
ud beech. 

4. Ritert. The most celebrated river of Germany is the Rhint. 
tad, Ming over two lai^e cataracts, flows westerly lo Basle, where it 
ineeo France and Germany, and begins its northerly course ; it th 
Don north and northwest to the Netherlands, through which it pass< 
â– anitfas. It is in general a broad, deep, and rapid river, and its sbon 
nMoantic scenery ; bat as it approaches the sea, its waters become 
level country, and the grandeur of its appearance is totally lost. Its w 
fbr the frreater part of which, it is navieable. Its chief branches . 

The Â£Jfrt rises in the SuJetic mountains of Silesia, and Sows northwester! 
Ocean. It is 575 miles in length, end is a good navigable stream ; its chief 
JMle and Haeel, The Oder rises in the mountains of Moravia, end flows 9 
eAj into the Baltic ; its length is 400 miles ; its chief branch is ibe Warth 
. fotrned of sevenl bead streams in the northwesl, and flows in that direction 
(knn ; it is 270 miles in length. The Danube is a German river for tl 
tomt ; it flows easterly through the southern part of Germany into the Hun]^ 

5. Climate. The climate of Germany is modiGed by ihe elevation of the surface, and the 
npoiure of the different sections. For purposes of general description, it may be divided Into 
twee re^ons. In the first, or that of the northern plains, the climate is humid and variable, 
il)oti|h not cold ; it is exposed to every wind, which conveys fogs and storms from two seas. 
The Dorthwestem plain, from iu vicinity to the North Sea, is subject to frequent rains and de- 
nbiiDg tempests, while the influence of the Baltic Sea on the northeastern plain, is less power- 
td, ud the climate, though colder, is less variable. The second re^on comprehends all the 
ceotnl part of Germany, which is sheltered by the mountains from the variableness and humid- 
it; of the maritime climate ; this zone, the most agreeable of Germany, extends from latitude 
48Â° to 61Â°, but the general elevation of the surface renders it colder than other European 
<^WQtne3 of the same latitude. The third general division is the Alpine section ; here the 
lof^ heights and sudden depressions bring very different climates into contact with each other. 
Tfae eternal glaciers of the Tyrol and Sallzburg are contiguous to tlie vine-covered valleys of 
Btiht and Carinthia, and but little removed from the olive groves of Trieste, and the ever- 
^(tx^niag gardais of Italy. Vines, rice, and maize thrive as fiur north aa 54Â° ; beyoad that

in that small part of Gemiajiy which lies south of 46Â°. 

6. Soil. The soil is geDerall^ productive. The plains in the north bBve, indeed, mueb 
trid land, but tlong the rivers are rich and fruitful soils, yielding abtindaiit harvests. lo tfaq 
south, there ia much barren or slightly productive land on the mountains, but the beautiful nd- 
leys and small plains rival in fertility the best alluvial lands on the banks of the northern riven. 
In general, the soil in the .north is heavy, and best adapted for com ; in the south light, and 
best fitted for vines. The best soil is in the central section, betweea the mountsins ud ibt 
sandy plains. 

7. ^nimalt. The chamois b found upon the Noiic and Rhnttan Alps. Fo^es, martaa, 
weasels, polecats, and wolves descend from the mountains into Silesiit and Moravia. Bears in- 
habit the Alps of Stiria, Illyiia, and the Tyrol. Wildcats are common. 

8. Face of the Country. The southern districts are traversed by lofty and steep moimtiio*. 
Toward (he centre of the country they decrease in elevation, till they gradually sink inloi 
^ift. The northern parts are level, and exhibit immense peat marshes and saady disltica, 
The eottst is so flat, that dikes ve rwuired to keep out the sea. The soutbero part sf Or* 
many presents every variety of romantic and picturesque scenery. The norihem is a mifam, 
undiversified level.

10. iTiKatntatUi. The Gemua 

are descended from tbe ancient tribes 

which formerly inhabited the forew 

of the country, living in wild fteedms, 

and subsisting principally by tbe cbaM. 

The Gomans are hardy and robnit, 

and have generally light hair and coDf 

plexions, with blue eyas, etpeciilly 

in tbe north. In Prussia, they n* 

IhffiiiM tftki CmitTH â– ( flnilmrnir* tall, and jhe hair and moustache irÂ» 

often so white, that ibey kwk Kla 

cotton, i^en opposed to the glowing and ruddy cheek. There are generally four clasiet of 

nobility, wlucb are thus ritled, Prince, Count, mron, and Herr Von ; the latter is tke fint step 

diove plebeianism, and answers to the French addition of De. 

II. Dreti. The lower classes dress in the manner the most ccmvenient for their occupatioDi, . 
and without any very distinguishing pecuriarities ; the higher chsses follow English and Fmcb 
fiuhions. Caps are nearly universal with the men ; they are made of ckith, with lew aromn, 
two or three inches only m height, and have a small projection over the eyes. The feimli 
peasants and domestics wear, on holydays, gaudy caps of gold stufls, and those who are toe 
poor to wear these, adorn their heads and arms with a few flowers. 

13. LangvMge. The German laifguage has several dialects, but the high German is thu 
which is spoken by all educated men in the diflerent Slates, and in which tbe literature is coo- 
tuned. The low German is the Frisish, used on the shores of the German Oceu, aad nrare 
Soperly, the dialect used in Westphalia, Mecklenberg, Brandenburg, and Pomeranii. Tb* 
erman was hardly cultivated in Germany, in the middle of the last century. Science spoke 
in Latin, and fashion in French. Voltaire, who always spoke in epignm, said, that be woido 
address bis mistress in Italian, his friend in French, a dog in Dutch, and the devil in Gemto. 
The German, however, is a rich and copious language, containing more words than any oAer, 
and having the power of making inexhaustible compounds. As the Latin was lately the tm- 
guage in which scholars communicated, the Germans are more familiar with -it, as a clisuc 1Â«- 
Â«iage, than gny other nation. French, also, is very common, and English is becomii^ a b'O'' 
nte smdy. 



. 19. JWH m g r Â«f BnSMng. In tbe modern arcbitecture (^ere is little to interest a strangeri 
is Grermanj. Omerally, the old towns are dark, dismal, and mean in appearance. The mod- 
eta ekies are, some. of them, spacious and neatly built. The gardens attached to country bens* 
m are often in the English style. The Gothic churches are, some of them, wonderful monu* 
nents of labor and art. 

Hi P9od and Drink. The (Germans take more food than their southern neighbors, and of 
I pMn, substantial Idnd. The common people follow the plainest style of cooking, and Â«re fond 
of fct substances, which they use with sour cabbage. 

The ancient character is not yet extinct, for the Germans are moch addicted to intoxicating 
Iii|Qors, especially in the north, where they consume great quantities of beer, porter, and a)e. 
Aiehocises are but too well supported ; the sign over them in some of the States is, *^ Wekome, 
firiend," and few coachmen pass without taking schnape. 8moke and beer make the atmos* 
phere of a cogmmon German. Drunkenness, however, is most frequent in the north. In the 
saoth is a more genial beverage, produced on the baidcs of the ^* Father of wine," for so die 
Geraians delight to call the Rhine. 

The wines of (Germany are much esteemed. They are various, but the most celebrated are 
the Hock and the Johannisberg. The Hock is produced so far porth, that the rividr is frozen 
for weeks in winter, and the vine would probably tlirive well in the United States. The Jo* 
baanisberg is not easily to^ be had. It is produced only on a small domain, the property of 
Priaee Metternich, and it is chiefly sent as presents to sovereigns. Those of the alliance are 
proUbhr the most fevored. It seHs on the spot for little less than two dollars a bottle. 

Snoking is almost an emplcmnent in Germany. The pipe is ever at hand, and it is seldom 
out of use. The bowls are oi porcelain, large and ornamented with views of German scene- 
ly, boikKags, &c. The atmospnere of an alehouse is so filled with smoke of numerous pipes, 
thtt the smokers are hardly visible. 

15. Di$e(tte$. These are generally the same that are conmion in the United States, though 
there are feirer pulmonary complaints in Germany. 

16. TraceKng. This is more expensive, and less expeditious, than in France. The coach* 
es b some parts go little more than three miles an hour, and the ichnell ijoagen or velocity 
coach, which is established on some routes, goes but six 'miles an hour. The coeht d^eau or 
witer coach, which is found on the rivers, has little to reconmiend it but cheapness. 

17. Character^ Manners^ and Ctutomi. The Germans are descended from various tribes, 
with similar features, languages, and manners, which anciently overspread nearly the whole 
of what is now called Grermany. They were rude and ararlike, and successfully with- 
stood the Roman arms. The legions of Varus were the sacrifice to German patriotism and 
raior. The Germans held, that the brave only enjoyed the favor of the gods alter dealk. 
They were more attached to their wild freedom than to life. They were implacable to foes, 
tbougb kind and gentle to each other. They followed gaming to the most frantic excess, and 
were much addicted to intoxicating liquors ; it was only when intoxicated, that they debated in 
tkeir public councils matters of general interest. 

The Germans retam, in a high state of cultivation, some of the traits by which they were 
Btttked while they were barbarous tribes ; Aey are hardy, brave, and attached to their country. 
Tbey are distinguished for great individual and personal independence, and the word ^^ Father* 
W" never fails to touch the ** electric chain," by which they are bound to their country. 
Tbejr are fiiithful and sincere, and deceit is foreign to their nature. They are imaginative, 
thoirii they have great powers of labor and reflection. ' They were formerly thought to be 
ploMing and dull, but this was a great error. One of their writers has said truly, that while 
the EagKsh have the dominion of the sea, and the French that of the land, the Germans have 
the empire of the air. The national character is so much founded upon justice, that the publie 
never forgives a want of probity, as it sometimes does in Italv or France. 

^^ With few but signal exceptions, Germany, even at this hour, is not a country remarkable 
for die elegancies of domestic life. Its very palaces are of simple decoration ; its luxuries of a 
hcnnebred and inartificial kind, and its taste is rarely superior, and, indeed, not always equal to 
car own. There is still a shade of the Gothic in the habits and opinions of this constant peo- 
ple, irtio seem to cultivate the subtile refinements of the mind, in preference to the more obvi- 
cos and material enjoyments which address themselves to the senses." 

The Germans are fond of titles, and exceedingly complaisant in bestowing them. A letter 

totcount is addressed, $o the k^ bam Coymi^ Couni of B . To a pkin ckiien the iri- 

40

dress nms, to the well bom Mr.y Mr* R . These eustomsi hovretrer, are goitt{ out Qli<m% 

in some parts. There is a feminine substantive, corresponding to the masculine title, aad tbi 
wivâ‚¬s are alfvajs addressed by the titles of their husbands ; as the Lady Pro^essoress, the h^ 
CouQselioress of Justice, the Lady Generaless ; Gnadigt JFVau, or Gracious Lady, is the col* 
loquial title of one of the nobility. The Germans use many profane exclamations, and Lwi 
Jesus J and Dear Ctod^ are heard in every one's speech* The exclamations of surprbe ore 
Godh thousand^ hundred^ lightnings or thunder. Thunder und Doria^ taken from Schiller^s 
Fiesco, is in use with the students. When the Germans part, they say, jfnay you live Aofgnljf. 
In li passbg salute they raise their hats high above their heads. Friends, wh^ they are about 
to part, or when they meet, kiss each other, not on the cheek, as in Italy, but on the lijps, 
which have generally an abattb of moustaches. The German ladies have a toucfaiog voice, fair 
and dazzling complexions, with great sensibility and fancy. Madame de Stael remarks, that tbey 
^^ coquet with entliusiasm," not like the French and English, with pleasantry and wit Tbejr 
have an inveterate custom, high and low, noble and peasant, of knitting stoclungs, wherever 
they are. It is as general as the custom of smoking with the sterner sex. 

The Germans though they have frequent quarrels, seldom come to blows ; a blow is an in- 
dignity, that nothing but the offender's blood can atone, and a man in common life would appeal 
to arms to avenge it. Hard words are applied in profusion, and to scold b a common way of 
quarreling ; ^^ a mode," says Russell, ^^ that annihilates the distinction between the sexes.^^ 
The German character, it must be remembered, is somewhat various, in the different States ; 
and, as has been said, it is as much parceled out as the land, though there are certain traits dial 
rtm through the whole. The difference is greatest between the north and the south, and die 
literary and the commercial towns. 

The Germans of the south are, in general, less favorably distinguished for morality and intel- 
ligence than those of the north, and much less has been done m the former . secuon towardi 
enlightening the great mass of the people ; yet there are many exceptions to this remark. 1o 
many quarters of the country the mond condition of the peasantry is very miserable ; ignorant, 
superstitious, dull, indolent, and dirty in their habits, and slovenly in their mode of cultivation, 
they still bear the traces of their recent servitude. 

18. Amusements. Many of the amusements are those which are common in England 
France. The favorite active sport is the chase of the wild boar, and although the game priTi- 
leges may be, as in England, distinct from the soil, yet all classes are permitted to attend die 
prince in the chase, but not otherwise to engage in the sport. Hares are exceedingly numerous, 
and they are hunted not with gr^-hounds, but with peasants. These form a large circle, and, 
with great vociferation, close by degrees upon a centre, driving the hares before them. The 
hunters shoot them down in great numbers, and a random shot sometimes hits one of those who 
act as the pack. But dancing is the national amusement, and it is pursued with more entbu* 
siasm than in France. The waltz is the national dance, and it is introduced into most of the 
foreign figures that prevail in Germany. Fathers and sons are seen in the same dance ; all 
classes dance, except that which has the dignity of royalty to support. Royal personages only 
polonaise^ in a light, airy step, between a dance and a walk. 

19. Education. In the means of education, the north of Germany far stu*passes every other 
country. The Protestant States are. more enlightened than the Catholic, and in Saxony diere 
is hardly a peasiuit, that cannot read and write. In Prussia, there are upwards of 20,000 ele- 
mentary schools. The Gymnasiums of the north of Germany are celebrated ; they are schools 
preparatory to the universities ; but the studies pursued in diem are equal to those of the uni- 
versities, in some countries. The gymnastic exercises are purstied with ardor in some, though 
in the most they are discontinued. The universities of Germany are the best in the world. 
They have students from every European nation, and from America. The universities of Gottin- 
gen, Berlin^ Bonn, Jena, Halle, and Leipsic, are the most celebrated. The 23 universities of 
Germany ar^ attended by about 16,000 students ; there are at that of Berlin, 1,600 ; of Vien- 
na, 1,950 ; of Munich, 1,500 ; of Prague, 1,450 ; of Leipsic, 900 ; of Halle, 700 ; of Got- 
tingen, 700. The instructions are given in a great measure by lectures, and one professor often 
lectures on several subjects. The libraries are the best and most extensive in the world ; and 
any student may take out many books at a time, a hundred if he will. The libraries contain all 
that is valuable in ancient or modem science. The library at Gottingen contains 300,000 vol- 
umes, all collected in less than a century. North of the Mayne, it is difficult to travel for a 
diQP wilfaoiit fiodii^ a library ; at Carlsruhe is one of 70,000 volumes ; at the distance of a few

to, of 100,000. Thirty miles from Frankfort is a small library of 20,000 volumes, but i^ 
Muturg, 20 miles further, b one of 55,000. At Cassel the library contains 70,000 volumes, 
ud ftem this town the traveler may arrive in a day at Oottingen, wh^e he finds a coUection 
of 900,000 books ; and at Wolfenbuttel, about 40 miles distant, is another of 200,000. At 
Hamburg are 2 libraries, one of 25,000, the other of 80,000 volumes. At Weimar is anoth* 
er Ebraiy of 95,000 volumes, and at Jena a second of 30,000. Dresden has one of 260,000 
foiattes ; Berlin another of 300,000, and Munich, one of the greatest, 600,000. Thirty-on^ 
Ebnries in Germany contafai more than 3,300,000 volumes, or, on an average, 107,000 each 
The 31 largest libraries in the United States do not contain 250,000 volumes. There are in 
ill Germany 150 public libraries, containing 5,000,000 volumes. 

The Germans are indefatigable students, and many of the learned have devoted 15 hours 
(Uiy to study. The students at the universities have many peculiarities. Their dress is afiectÂ«- 
edlv uncouth, and it is worn with negligence. The coat is shapeless, the hair is worn long, 
aDO a wide shirt collar is turned over the shoulders. Boots are always worn, and to these are 
fixed spurs of enormous dimensions. One or more rings, as large as watch-seals, generaUv 
adorn the fingers, and no student in full dress is without a ruffle of unreasonable length, though 
many have no shirts. This, with a pipe 4 or 5 feet in length, completes the equipment. 

The moustache is permitted to grow several inches long, and it is twisted to a point. The 
stodeats call themselves Burscheriy or ^^ young fellows," par excellencey and the town's people 
they call Philistines. The students in the north of Germany are great consumers of beer ; 
and those of the south are no less devoted to wine. In their evening potations, each one has 
setreral tankards set before him, sometimes as many as 9, so that a line of students on each 
side of a table, may look down upon 18 rows of tankards. In the south, the Burschen 
songs are b praise of wme ; but in the north, they celebrate the virtues of beer. The follow 
iog is a stanza ; 

'^ Come, broUietiy be jorial, while lift creeps along, 
Make the walla nAg around os, wiUi laughter and song ; 
Thouffh wine, it is true, be a rarity here. 
We *u be jolly as gods, on tobacco and beer. 
VivaDenllerallera." 

Hie Students unite m clubs called Landsmanmchaftenj composed of those ot the same 
cOQDtiy or district, and their club is generally indicated by the color or trimming of the cap. 
Thej pay a few dollars on entering^ for the expenses of the club, though the money thus 
raised is generaDy applied to the purchase of duelling apparatus, and each Land9mann$ehafi 
has a complete armory. Duelling may be said to be universal ; of course it is not attended 
with much peril. It is an example of moderation to have passed several years at a university 
withoot a duel. The party challenged has not the privilege of choosing his weapons ; he must 
6gfat according to the established mode. The weapon is a straight sword, about 3 feet in 
l^h, with a double edge near the point, that will cut both ways. The combats are generally 
held b rooms, and few of them are fatal. A few friends and a surgeon are present, with the 
two seconds, and an umpire chosen by them. The hands and arms are covered with thick 
glo7es, and a stuffed leathern breastplate completely protects the body. The face only is ex- 
posed. For a trifling offence, 12 blows are struck, and if no blood is drawn, the parties shake 
haods and separate. For a greater offence, blood is to be drawn ; on its first appearance^ the 
uomire orders a suspension of hostilities, and the surgeon examines the wound. If it be two 
inches in length, and opens of itself one fourth of an inch, enough has been done for glory, and 
the parties are reconciled. The seconds are dressed like the combatants ; they stand by the 
side of their principals and are permitted to ward off the blows. The combatants sometimes 
lose an eye or a nose ; many have scars on their faces, and some are miserably hacked. The 
^^''i^dmannschafUn are the nurseries of duelling ; each club being exceedingly tenacious of its 
OWD dignity. Fencing, very improperly, makes a part of the university instruction. All the 
<ktajl8 of the duel are fixed in the comment^ or Burschen Pandects. 

12. State of the Art$^ Science^ and LitertUure. The Germans had Albert Purer and oth* 
^ ia painting ; and Schadow and Danneker are living sculptors of merit ; but music is the 
oadonal art ; the taste for it is universal, and at a German concert the deepest silence prevails ; 
^^ eye is fixed on the performers, and a general disapprobation would be expressed shorid

The inhabitants of Germany may rank next to the Italians as the most successfiil cultiYaton 
of music ; and it is even doubuul whether, with regard to eminent composers, tbqr do not carrf 
off the pdm from the most musical of nations. Instrumental music, especially, which reqaim 
hbor and perseverance, qualities for which the German character is so much distinguished, has 
been brought by them to great perfection ; and if their composiuoo is of a more labored char- 
acter than the Italian, it has also more science, and affords more pleasure than any other) to 
tfaose who are capable of appreciating it The organs and organists of Germany, as wtXk es 
their vioUa performers, have long been famous over Europe. Before the 16th centtiry^ there 
was lltde music in any country except masses and madrigals, the two principal divisions of 
sacred and secular music ; and in the former, the Germans more especially excelled. In the 
16th century, among their most eminent composers and theorists were, Keischius, Michael 
Koswick, Hennr Loris, Taber, and Hoffinan. When dramatic omsic came mto (ashioa, the 
opera, imported from Italy, was introduced into the German capitals, and patronized bjr the 
German princes. So late, however, as the 17th century, the performers in the Geimaa 
operas, were tradesmen and handicrafts. Shoemakers performed the first parts ; and girls, t^ho 
during the day sold fruits and sweetmeats through the streets, appeared in the evening as 
Armida or Semiramis. This exhibition soon rose to a more respectable character, and at abocH 
the period when Handel began to acquire celebrity, the Italian opera, especially at Dresden Â» at 
the court of Augustus, Elector of Saxony, was performed in the nx>st splendid manner. 
Handel himself, one of the most eminent composers, whether of Germany or of any other 
country, was in the service of the Elector of Hanover, afterwards George the First, when his 
fame began to be spread all over Europe. He. was th^ first who introduced oratorios into 
England, and, at his own risk, engaged a whole band of performers for the London opera. 
His oratorios of the Messiah and Samson, his Acis and Galatea, and all his numerous compo- 
sitions, are too well known to require praise ; and, however the caprice of fashion, which brii^ 
about nearly as many changes in musical taste as in uiy other, may neglect the harmony of 
Handel for more brilliaot melody, his name will always be venerated, and his compositions ad- 
mired, by all true judges of the art. The English were not ungrateful for the services which 
Handel had rendered to music in their country, and the year 1784 was rendered memorable in 
the annals of the art, by the splendid manner in which his birth and genius were celebrated in 
Westminster Abbey, and the Pantheon, by fine performances of pieces, selected from his own 
works, and executed by a band of more than 500 voices and mstruments, in the presence of 
the royal family and the first persons of the kingdom. The commemoration of Handel has 
since been established as an annual musical festival for charitable purposes. 

But the prince of German musicians, even among a host of eminent composers, is undotabt- 
edly Mozart, a rare instance of an infant prodigy, whose manhood more than surpassed the 
promise of hb eariy years. All his performances breathe the same sensitive and deUcate spirit 
with which nature had endued him, even to a degree of morbid acuteoess, and .to an extent 
which incapacitated him for the labors and duties of life. There is more depth <^ feeling in 
bis works than brilliancy, and even his most lively composi^ns have a tinge of saaftess^ He 
is dignified, without severity, and tender even in bis most cheerful mood. He may rank aaaong 
musicians as Raphael among painters ; while Handel, with the severe majesty of aa ancient 
artbt, has infinitely less grace and melody. But it would be tedious to enumerate the Grennao 
composers, who have enriched music by their splendid works. We can only mention Haydn, 
who may be Iranked next to Mozart ; Beethoven, whose compositions have afforded the utmost 
pleasure to the lovers of science and harmony ; and Weber, whose untimely death has caused 
a blank in the musical world, which the pleasure derived from his splendid operas can hardly 
compensate. His style b truly German and original, full of striking passages, and capricious, 
but beautiful changes. It speaks of dark forests, and frowning precipices, where the torrent 
appears suddenly to stop the listener's progress, or where he rests for a while to breathe the 
clear, pure air of the mountain tops ; or to hearken to the huntsman's horn, as it echoes among 
the rooks. Among his countryoheo his name is spoken with enthusiasm, and his death wea a 
signal for mourning throughout Germttiy, where the excellence of his private character was as 
fiiUy appreciated as the splendor of his talents. There is no country in the world where mili- 
tary music is carried to greater perfectioa than in Austria, where the bands surpass all othera^

Is of pi^es, their mosle was probably^ ISkt the tia^nal character, rode and mar^. The 
mlMre airs of the Tyrol breathe the yerjr spirit of mountain freedom and wildness. The melo- 
dies are nsudly of.a cheerful cast, but it is mountain mirth; wild, mspiring, and untamed. 
Several of the natives of the Tyrol, who have left their hills, and traveled through England m 
hopes of profit, have been listened to with the utmost pleasure, by the most scientific audien- 
ces. The family of the Rauiers especially, who some years since made their appearance in 
LKMidon, were patronised by George the Fourth, and their melodies were collected and ar- 
ranged by an eminent composer. 8onie of these airs were already well known, though the 
manner of singing them, peculiar to the natives, caused them to have aQ the effect of novelty. 
Others were said to be the original compositions of FeUx RaiHer, and exhibit much taste and 
simple beauty. Upon the whole, if the Germans are inferior to the Italians as vocal perform- 
er8> and are, generally speaking, a less musical people, owing to their disadvantages of lan- 
gqage and climate, they are, in musical science, decidedly superior to them. 

The literature of Germany, though recent, is extremely rich ; yet it is less national, or local, 
fhaa that of any other country. It abounds in poetry and criticbm, and the German poets havB 
been very successful in the principle of terror. But every department of science and literature 
is filled with treasures, and the following are but a few of the German jurists, poets, critics, phi- 
losophers, and astronomers : Pufiendorf, Klopstock, Wieland, Schiller, Gothe, Richter, Lessmg, 
Leibnitz, Werner, Herder, the Schlegels, Eichhom, Kant, Humboldt, Herschel, and Kepler. 

20. Religion. This is generally Catholic or Protestant ; but the Catholics are the most 
Runnerous body. The States in which they form the majority, are Bavaria, Baden, Luneburg, 
Hohenzollern, and Lichtenstein. There are many Catholics also in the Prussian States,- Wir- 
temberg, Hesse, and Hanover* In the other States the Protestants outnumber the Catholics. 
There are about 500,000 Jews, who are variously restricted in the different States. In Prus- 
sia only, have they all the rights of citizens. The superstitions of the Germans are similar to 
chose of the English. The ignorant believe in a kind fairy, in the wild huntsman, and bis 
phantom hounds, urging the chase, and in the annual assemblage of witches in the Hartz forest. 

In Prussia, persons betrothed give notice of the fact in the newspapers, and an addition to 
the family is announced in the same way.^ Divorces are of frequent occurrence, in some of 
the German States. In Prussia alone there were 3,000 in the year 1817. 

21 . L0ato8. The German character is generally a better safeguard to justice, than the per 
fectioQ of the laws. Open courts are rare. In some of the northern States, no criminal can 
be executed till he has made confession ; but when convicted, he is shut up in a dungeon, more 
disinsd and cold than that of Trenk ; an abode of misery, in which innocence itself would con- 
fess for the alternative of the scaffold. In Prussia, the punishment of death is inflicted by de- 
capitation, with a large sword, by burning, and by breakmg on the wheel. Instances of buro- 
ing are very rare. In breaking on the wheel, the head is sometimes crushed first, and after- 
wards the breast and limbs ; but the torture is much prolonged, when the limbs are broken 
first- Peasants in Germany, are generally hereditary tenants. In Prussia, servitude was abol- 
ished in IS 11, though before that time no person could hold land, unless he was ennobled. 

22. nSrUiquities. These are mostly gothic. On the Rhine, and in some other parts, are 
inanjr gothic castles, in every state of decay ; in some the portals remain, as in the feudal ages, 
wiiQe others are dilapidated, and shapeless. The large towns have museums, in which are pre- 
serred the figures of knights, clothed in nuiil, together with all the various arms and equip- 
ments of feudal warfare. 

23. Government. The German confederacy was formed in 1815, to protect the indepen- 
dence and secure the tranquillity of the States which entered into it. Thirty-six monarchical 
States, and 4 Republics or Free Cities, were the parties to the federal act. The. organ of the 
coafederacy is the Diet, composed of the plenipotentiaries of the sovereign members ; it is con- 
stituted in 2 different forms. 1. The Plenum or general assembly, in which each member has 
at least 1 vote, and the great powers have several ; Austria, Prussia, Bavaria, Saxony, Hano- 
ver and Wirtemberg have each 4 votes ; Baden, Hesse-Darmstadt, Hesse-Cassel, Denmark^ 
(for Holstein and Lauenburg), and the Netherlands (for Luxemburg) each 3; Brunswick,

24. Army. The army ol the confederation consists of 300,000 men, each State fumishmg 
a contingent of troops, proportionate to its population. There are several cities considered ai 
federal fortresses ; these are Luxemburg, Mayence, Landau, Ulm, &c. 

25. History. Germany, in ancient times, was divided into a number of principalities, inde- 
pendent of each other, though occasionally connected by a military union. The greater part 
of the country was subjected by the Romans ; and in the beginning of the 8th century, Chsu^ 
magne extended his authority over the whole empioe. In the 10th century it became an elec- 
tive monarthy, and princes of different famiUes, according to the prevalence of their interests 
and arms, were called to the throne. The houses of Saxony, Franconia, and Suabia, exer- 
cised the imperial power successively, but in the 15th century it became hereditary in the 
House of Austria. The German Empire was broken up in 1806 by Napoleon, who form^ 
several of the States into a union called the Rhenish Confederation. Upon the settlement of 
the afliurs of Europe at the Congress of Vienna, in 1814, the Empire was not reestablished, 
but a new form of government was proposed, which resulted in the present act of confederaboa. 



CHAPTER XXVIL GRAND DUCHY OF BADEN. 

1. Boundaries and Population. The Grand Duchy of Baden is bounded on the N. by 
ducal Hesse ; on the E. by Bavaria and Wirtemberg, and on the S. and W. by the Binne, 
which separates it from Switzerland and France. Area, 5,700 square miles ; popolalson, 
in 1846, 1,349,930. 

2. Face of the Country ^ Rivers j &c. Baden consists mostly of a fertile plain, containii^ 
excellent corni-fields and vineyards. On its eastern border extends the mountainous chain ol 
the Black Forest^ in which rises the Danube. The J^eckar^ a tributary of the Rhine, flow* 
through the northern part of the Duchy. The Rhine washes its western and southern border- 
The lake of Constance forms a part of the southeastern boundary. The climate is miU and 
genial. The soil is good, and vegetation luxuriant. There are mines of silver and iron, and 
quarries of freestone and marble. Mineral springs and hot baths are very numerous. In the 
duchy of Baden are above 300 hot baths, some of which are scalding hot ; all of them spring 
out of rocks of alum, salt, and sulphur. The State takes its name, signifying baths, from this 
circumstance. 

3. Industry. Its central position between the Swiss, French, and German territories, and 
its situation upon the navigable waters of the Rhme, give Baden a considerable transit trade. 
Its manufactures are not extensive ; toys, trinkets, and wooden clocks are the principal artiÂ« 
cles ; these, with the products of its forests, vineyards, and pastures, are exported. 

4. Religion and Government. The majority of the inhabitants are Roman CathoIic^s, hm 
the grand duke is himself a liUtheran. Liberal provision is made for the education of all 
classes, by the maintenance of elementary and Latin schools, and gymnasia or higher schools. 
There are universities at Heidelberg and Freyberg. The government is a constitutional mon- 
archy, the legislative authority being vested in 2 houses or chambers. 

5. Divisions and Towns. The grand duchy is divided into 4 circles, which are subdivided 
mto aemte or bailiwics. 

. CarlsruhCj the capital, is a handsome and regularly built city, near the Rhine, with ^6,000 
inhabitants. The 9 principal streets diverge in different directions from the ducal pehce^ and 
are intersected at regular intervals by cross-streets, forming concentric circles. The dtical li- 
brary contains 70,000 volumes, and there are fine gardens attached to the palace. In the vi^ 
cinirfr is Baden^ with 6,500 inhabitants, celebrated for its mineral waters, which are aaamaDv 
resorted to by unwards of 8,000 visiters. There are here 26 warm springs, in some of wlnci 
meat can be cooked.

rdest is a handsome city, situated at the confluence of the Neckar with the Rhine. It was once 
â€¢tlie cesideoce of the court of the elector palatine, and its palace, observatory, literary instttoi^ 
tioDS, and population^ 22,000 inhabitants, render it important. Freyberg is noted for its mu?er^ 
sity, and its magnificent Gothic minster, the spire of which is nearly 500 feet high, being oof 
of ibe loftiest in Europe. Population, 15,000. Heidetterg contains one of the oldest and 
most respectable universities in Germany. The situation of the town is delightful ; strangers 
are here shown a tun of enormous size 

CHAPTER XXVIII. KINGDOM OF WIRTEMBERG. 

9 

1. Boundaries and Populaium. The kingdom of Wirtemberg is bounded N. and Â£. by 
Bavarbi, and S. W. and N. by Baden. Its southern border also touches lake Constance; 
Area, 7,600 square miles ; population, in 1850, 1, 749,827* 

2. Surface and Rtotre. Two mountainous ranges traverse the country ; the Schwartzwdldy 
CM* Black Foreety extends through the western part ; many of the summits in this range, which 
contains the sources of the Danube, are from 3,500- to 4,600 feet high ; the Alb Jlf<mntotnt, 
or Swabian Mps, branch off from die Schwartzwald in the southwestern part of Wirtemberg, 
and traverse the kingdom in a northeasterly direction, separating the waters of the Neckar from 
cbose of the Danube ; they are less elevated than the former. The .ATecfcar, which rises in the 
Alb mountams, flows north and west into the Rhine, after a course of 160 miles. The mine- 
nds are silver, copper, iron, cobalt, sulphur, coal, limestone, alabaster, agate, &c. Warm 
baths and medicinal springs are numerous, and those of Heilbron are particularly celebrated. 

Wirtemberg is one of the most fertile and best cultivated parts of Germany, producing com, 
wine, and various fruits. Except in the mountainous tracts, the surface is agreeably diversified 
widi moderate hills and pleasant valleys, and the climate is mild. 

3. hduetru. This kingdom produces great supplies of grain, chiefly spelt ; for rye and 
wheat are little cultivated. Flax and hemp are raised, and the mountains are covered with vines 
which produce a rich and wholesome wine called J^tckar. Cherries are cultivated extensi^ly 
in some parts for manufacturing the strong liquor callen Kirsckwaeeer, Fruit trees are abun- 
dant ; cider and perry are made in great quantities. A singular yet considerable branch of inÂ« 
dustry is the feeding of enaiU ; millions of which are fattened in the neighborhood of Ulm 
during autumn, and exported to Vienna and Italy. Manufactures are not numerous ; but some 
cloth and lace are made in a few of the towns ; and there are many large distilleries and oil mills. 
The exports are cattle, com, wood, tar, potash, oil, and a few manufactured goods. Iron 
mines are worked in the Black Forest, and iron and salt are exported. The book^trade of Wir- 
temberg is an important branch of industry ; but the situation of the country is not so favorable 
as that of Baden, for commercial operations. 

4. Religion^ JSdueationy and Government. The Lutheran religion is professed by the great 
m^rity of the inhabitants ; but nekrly one third are Roman Catholics. There is one univer- 
sity, at Tubingen, and there are numerous lyceums, gymnasiums, and popular schools. The 
government is a hereditary, constitutional monarchy, the king possessing the executive power, 
and sharing the legislative with the two bouses. 

5. IHvmoni and Towne. Wirtemberg is divided into four circles ; the Neckar, the 
Schwartzwald, the Danube, and the Jaxt. 

The capital is StvUtgard, delightfully situated b a charming country, a few miles from the 
Neckar. The royal palace is a noble structure, and the library, one of the richest in Europe, 
containing 137,000 volumes, is particularly remarkable for its collection of Bibles, the most 
miraerous in the world, comprising 8,250 copies, in 68 languages. The Solitude or Hermit- 
agOt the country residence of the king, is beauUfuUy situated upon a bill, near the capital, and is 
cemarkable for its fine prospect, magnificent halls, and handsome gardens. Population of Stutt- 
gwd, 46,000. 

Urn, on the Danube, is a place of some trade and considerable manufiictures. Its cathedral, 
dwQ^ unfinidiod, is one of the finest specimens of Gothic architecture. Population, 18,000. 
BeuiUingeni a manufacturing town, with 13,000 inhabitanU ; Tubingen^ 9,000 inhabitanU.

llUisiied in 1819* 



CHAPTER XXIX. KINGDOM OF BAVARIA. 

1. Boundaries and PopulaHon. Bavaria is bounded N. by Hesse, and the Saxon Duchies; 
E. and S. by the Austrian empire ; and W. by Wirtemberg and Baden. The circle of tin 
Rhbe is separated from the rest of the kingdom, lying on the western side of the Rhine b^ 
Iween Hesse, the 'Prussia province of the lower Ithine, and Trance. Area, 38|500 sqnre 
Biles ; population, in 1846, 4,504 fi74. 

2. Surface and Riven. In the northeastern part is the moontainoDS range, called JFUftti* 
gtUwgtj or Pine Mountains, which is neither extensive, nor very lofir ; yet it gives rise to ri^ 
m^j which, flowing into the Elbe, the Rhine, and the Danube, find their way to three difieretf 
wad distant seas* The Sohneeberg^ or Snowy Mountains, 3,500 feet high, is the h%hest sum* 
nit* In the northwest, on the right bank of the Rhine, is the low mountainous ri^ of the 
Sp ee smrL The Danube traverses Bevaria from west to east ; its principal tributaries in tbk 
Uogdom are the Isar and the Inn from the southwest. The Mayne or Maine rises in the ceo- 
irs of Bavaria, and flowing northerly and westerly through Baden and Hesse, empties itself into 
the Rhine, after a course of 250 miles. It is navigable to Bamberg. Much of the soil is od- 
productive from the rugged of marshy character of the surfiu^e, and there are extensive bop 
and forests. The climate is mild and healthy. 

3. Industry. Agriculture is much neglected, but a good deal of wine is produced. Bsn- 
ria is not favorably situated for trade, and its manufactures are not very extensive. lo some 
pavts, however, the people are distinguished for mechanical ingenuity ; and philoaophical instro* 
nients, toys, and clocks, besides articles required for domestic consumption, are produced. 

4. Divisions and Toums. The kingdom is divided into eight circles, called, till 1637, dhr 
tlw principal rivers, as in France, but now by ancient historical names.* 

Jtbmich (Muenchen,) the capital, is situated on the Isar, and the embellishments and additions, 
which it has received within the last 20 years, have rendered it one of the handsomest cities in 
Germany. Its environs are pleasant, being adorned with numeivus parks, gardens, and walks, 
and the streets of the city are in general spacious, with many elegant buildings. The literarjr 
institutions, scientific cabinets, cotlections of art, and the numerous publications issued from iti 
presses, give Munich u high rank among the learned cities of Europe. It is not distinguished 
for trade or mauufactures. The royal palace is one of the largest and most richly furnished 
royal residences in Europe; the magnificent glypthothekorsailpture-gallery ; the pinakothekor 
^nire-gallery ; the lar^e and beautiful theatre, called the Odeon ; the New Palace, 680 feel 
kttg ; several of the 22 churches, Stc., are sumptuous ecfificet. The university b one of tlM 
most respectable in Germany ; the public library contains 600,000 printed volumes, and 10Â»000 
jvaooscripts. Population, 115,000. At Schkisheim, in the vicinit}', there is a magnificent royal 
palace, will) a rich collection of 1,500 paintings. 

Nurembnrsr^ m German Nurnbernr, is an oki town, and the antiquated appearance of its 
j^treeis and buildings reminds the visiter of the Middle Ages, when it was one of the principai 
commercial and manufacturing cities of Europe, having been the great mart for the trade between 
haly and the north of Europe. The inhabiunts have been distinguished for their ingenuity and 
^11 m the fine and useful arts, and philosophical and musnal instruments^ metalic wares, look- 
tng-;jr|asses, toys, &:c., are made here. The Nuremburg toys amuse children in all parts of tlie 
Â«rorid ; they are made in great numbers by the peasants of the vicinity, assisted by their children, 
and sold so cheap as to be exported to all couutries. Population, 48,000. 

Augsburg, on the Lech, is a place of some trade and considerable manufactures. 1 he ars** 
nal, the principal in the kingdom, and its town*hall the finest m Germany, deserve to be men- 
tioned. Augsburg is interesting hi the histoiy of the Reformation as the place in whkA the

Eq^Ush general, Marlborough, over the united French and Bavarian armies, ia 1704* 

In RatUbon or IU^en$burgy on the Danube, were formerly held the sessions of the Getauot 
diet ; the town-hall, m which that body sat, is still to be seen. Population, 22,000. . Wmtz-

â–¼ated district, and contains a university, and other literary. mstitutiona, a handsome pakce, cita- 
del, kc BairexOh^ with 14,000 inhabitants, Furthy with 17,000, AntpacL, 16,000, mA 
PanaUj 10,000, have an extensive trade and manufactures. In the circle of the Rhine is 
S/rirtj with 8,000 inhabitants, in which the German Diets were often held. It waa at a Diet 
held here in 1529, that the religious reformers entered a Profit against certun acts of the em- 
peror, whence their name of Protestants. Denx-Ponts or Zwei-Brwikenj (i. e. Two Bridges, 
m XaIjo, Bipons) in this circle, is noted for the editions of the Gredc, Latin, and* Fraodi clas- 
sics published there, and thence called Bipont editions. 

5. jSe/tgton, Oovemnuntj tic. There are three universities at Munich, Wuniburg, and Er^ 
htogfiQj of which the two first are particularly distinguished ; and the government has paid nmdh 
attention to the improvement and extension of the means of education. The Roman Catbolie 
religioD is professed b^ the majority of the inhabitants, but the Lutherans are nunoerous. The 
gevenunent is a constitutional monarchy ; the legislative body is composed of two bouses, that 
of peers, styled the counsellors of the realm, and that of the deputies of the clergy, cities, and 
bndbnJders. Bavaria was an electorate of the old German empire ; but, on the establishnieBt 
of the Confederation of the Rhioe, by Napoleon, in 1806, it was erected into a kii^dom. 



CHAPTER XXX. KINGDOM OF SAXONY. 

1. Boundaries and PopulaHon. The kingdom of Saxony (Sachsen) is botjoided N. bf the 
PnusiaD provinces ; S. and E. by the Austrian, and W. by the Saxon duchies and Reoss. 
Aim, 5,700 square miles ; population, in 1846, 1,836,433. 

2. Surface and Rivers. The southern part is somewhat mountainous, being traversed by 
tbe Mrxgekirgej a ranee of mountains, whicn separates Saxony from Bohemia in Austria ; the 
Bortbem part is more level. In the vicinity of Dresden rises a picturesque group of rocky hills, 
ioterspersed with rivulets and vales ; this district is called the baxon Switzerland, and is much 
visited. The Elbe is the only navigable river of Saxony. 

SÂ» industry. Much attention has been paid to sheep breeding, and the Saxony wool is noted 
for ks fineness ; the number of sheep is about 2,000,000, yielding 4,500,000 lbs. of wool. 
The v^etable products are similar to those of the other parts of northern Germany. Saxony 
has lo0t ks principal agricultural provinces, and little is raised in the kingdom except corn. 
Mamifaotures are active, and employ three fifths of the population ; they consist of thread, lin- 
ea, cottons, printed shawls, calicoes, lace, ribands, woolens, velvets,' carpets, paper, cutlery, 
pottery 9 dye-stufis, glass, and porcelain. .The mountainous districts are rich in mines, which 
are slaiftilly worked, and their productions are manufactured into various articles ; there are 
ceoooQ founderies, and mineral dyes, as verdegris, smalt from cobalt, &c., are made. The 
book-trade is very extensive, and there are linen, woolen, imd cotton manufectures. The pearl 
6sheÂ«7 is prosecuted in the river Elster. 

4Â« ReUgian^ EduetOion^ and Oavemmeni. The great majority of the inhabitants are Lutherans ; 
there are about Â§0,000 Roman CathoUcs, and 1,600 Hernnhutters. In no country in Europe 
has owe attentioa been paid to education. There is a university at Leipsic, widi mtmerous 
higb scboob and gymnasia, and there are common schools in^ all the parishes ; so that the lower 
cbssea are, very geseraUy, able to read and write. The government is a coastitutioeal mon- 
archy. 

5^ Dkfisions and Tovms. The kingdom b iBvided into four drelas, # which are aobdivided 
into diairkHs and bailiwioa. ^

&c. Population, 86,000, 
exclusive of many straugen 
who reside here, attracted 
by its treasures of art, hs 
excellent iostitutioos for ed- 
ucation, and its agreeable 
siiuation. In ihe vicioitj 
are PWnitz, with a magoifr- 
cenl summer residence of 
the royal family, and Koe- 
nigsUin, an impregnable 
mountain fortress, built up- 
on a rock rising out of tin 
plain to the height of 1 ,400 
feet ; it contains a well 1;200 
feet deep. 

Leipric or Leipzig is a well-built town, plessnntly situs ted in an extensive plain, and is chiefly 
remarkable for its trade and manufactures. Three great fairs are held bere annually, which an 
considered among the most important in the world. The number of purcliasers who asseiD- 
fale at these fairs, is 8,000 or 9,000, and the amount of the sales is between 15,000,000 and 
80,000,000 dollars. The book fairs, in particular, are unique, and Leipsic is the greatest booi 
nnrket imthe world. The university here is one of the best in Germany. Two celebrated 
battles have been fought on the plains of Leipsic ; In 1631, tbe Swedish king, Gustavus Adot- 
pbus defeated the troops of the empire here, and thus saved the Protestant cause ia tke nonb 
of Germany ; in the great battle of 1813, one of the most important in modern times, Napo- 
ileon wis obliged to retreat before the emperors of Russia and Austria, and the king of Pnis- 
aia, aflCT a protracted resistance of several days. Population of Leipsic, 60,000

eonsequence of the adherence of the king to the cause of Napoleon. 

CHAPTER XXXI. KINGDOM OF HANOVER. 

1. Botaidarie$ and Population. The kingdom of Hanover is bounded north by the 6^^ 
man Ocean ; east by the Elbe, which separates it from Denmark, by Mecklenburg- Schwerin, 
and by Prussia ; south by Prussia and Electoral Hesse, and west by the Netherlands. Area) 
14,600 square miles ; population, in 1845, 1,773,711. 

2. Surface and SoiL Tbe Hartz Mountains extend through the southern part ; the highest 
summit, the Broeken, has an elevation of 3,650 feet. These mountains are rich in minerals) 
yielding some gold, with much silver, iron, lead, copper, &c. They are well-wooded, and the 
forests are also a source ^f wealth to the inhabitants. The Brocket is famous as the supposed 
resort of the German witches, and of the wild huntsman of the Hartz. What is called the 
Spectre of the Brocken, is the magni6ed and distorted image of the spectator, reflected under 
certain circumstances from an opposite cloud. The northern part of Hanover is level, form- 
ing a part of the great European plain, which extends along the North and Baltic seas, from 
Paris to Moscow. In the south, the vaUeys are fertile ; in the north, are many barren heaths 
and moors. There are many shallow lakes, and on the coast is a wide bay, formed by the 
bursting in of the sea in 1277, when above 50 villages were destroyed. In East Friesland, is 
a subterranean lake, so thickly overgrown, that wagons pass over it. The climate is not agree- 
able. The winters are severe, and even in the greatest heats of summer) firos^ days are not 
uncommon. The temperature is very variable. 

3. Rivers. The Ems is a navigable stream, which flows northerly through the western part 
of the kingdom into the North Sea ; the JVeser^ which traverses the kingdom from south Â«to 
north, and the Elbe^ which washes its northern boundary, empty themselves into tbe same sea. 

4. Industry. Agriculture is in general in a low state ; the heaths of the north are not sus- 
ceptible of cultivation, but they are used as sheep-walks, or for the raising of bees. The 
mines and forests of the Hartz are diligently worked, and boards, iron, and copper, are, with 
cattle, the chief articles of export. The inland trade, favored by the Weser and Elbe, is con- 
siderable, but the foreign commerce is not extensive ; the articles imported are manufactured 
goods. 

5. Religion^ Educationy and Government. About four fifths of the inhabitants are Lutherans, 
the rest are Roman Catholics, Mennom'tes, and Jews. The government is a limited monarchy, 
but tbe representative principle is imperfectly in operation. There is a university at Gottingeo, 
one of the best in Germany, and the gjrmnasia and common schools are numerous. 

6. Dimsions and Towns. The kingdom is divided into 6 |ovemmentS)* taking the names 
of their capitals, and the captainship (Berghauptmannschaft) of Clausthal. 

Hanover^ the capital, situated in a sandy plain upon the Leine, contains a population of 
40,000 inhabitants, employed in commerce and manufactures. Hanover belonged to the Han- 
seatic league during the Middle Ages, and it has an antiquated appearance. The houses are 
generally of brick and timber in alternate layers, and resemble in appearance the stem of a ship 
of the 16ih century. The date of their erection is always marked upon them. In those of 
1565, each story projects over the one below it, and all are embellished with confused mixtures 
of medaUions, ragan deities, warriors, and verses from the Psalms. The palace is an elegun 
structure of hewn stone. 

Gotiingen^ situated in a fertile valley on the Leine, is one of tbe literary canitals of the 
world. Its university is the principal in Germany, or inferior only to that of Berlin. The 
Kbrary, the richest in the world in the department of modem literature, has 300,000 volumes. 
Tbe observatory is furnished with excellent instmments ; the botanical garden is one of the 
best in Europe ; the collections of natural history, the cabinets of natural philosophy, &c., and 
the valuable journals published here, render Gottingen tbe resort of the studious from all parti 
of the world. Population, 1 1 ,000. 

HiUeskeim, with 13,000 inhabitants ; Lmebmrg^ with 13,000) and Otnatwrg or Osnabnuk^ 
11)000) have considerable manufactiireft.

JSntden is the principfil port dnd cocQitiercial toi^n m the kingdom. F^puladott, 1 i,O0D. 

7. History. Hanover wa& one of the electorates of the old German Empire ; andeli^iD 
the last century the elector ascended the throne of Great Britain ; the two countries were vSt^ 
however, politically united. In 1815, Hanover was raised to the rank of a Ungdom, and, is 
the succession is in the male line, it became detached from the British crown on the succesMo 
of the present Qu^en to the latter, the Hanoverian crown passing to the first male heir of tk 
late British king. 

CHAPTER XXXII. GRAPrt) DUCHIES OF MECKLENBURG. 

1. Boundaries J &c. The two grand duchies of Mecklenburg lie between the Baltic ofi tk 
north, t^ssia on th6 south and east, and Hanover and Denmark on the west. They are bdA 
limited monarchies, and the inhabitants, with the exception of some Jews and a few Rooin 
Catholics, are Lutherans. The whole territory is a plain, interspe^d with low bills. Tie 
shore is protected by extensire downs of sand. The chief river is the Elbe ; there an 2 
number or lakes in the country. Agriculture is the chief occupation, and is well tnaoiged. 
Gresft quantities of apples are exported. The rearing of cattle is carried on extensively ; tbe 
liorses of diis countir are nrach esteemed. 

2. MukUmbutg'Schwerin. The Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin has an area rf 
4,700 square miles, witli 524,000 inhabitants. The capital, Scktserin^ prettily situated opoa 1 
lake of Uie same name, has 18,000 mbabitants. The grand duke usually resides is tbe ?iliqp

vided by a canal into the Old and New Town. The whole city is surrounded bv a lofty wo^ 
MTt, and a broad ditch. Most of the streets are narrow and dark, especially in the Old 
Town, and the houses are mostly in the Dutch fashion, 6 or 7 stories high. A few of the 
ittreets are handsome, and bordered by long and wide canals. The ramparts are planted with 
trees, and are so wide that they admit several carriages abreast. The churches are mostly 
Gothic, with beautiful altars, large organs, and lofty spires, covered with copper, which makes

* The Hanaeatic League was a celebrated association of 
the Middle Affes. Toward Uie middle of the 13th centary 
both sea and find were covered with pirates and robbers, 
â€¢ad the flourishing commerce of Germany was especially 
exposed. This sag gested a league for routoal assistance, 
and a confederacy was formed in 1239, between Hamburg, 
and the districts of the Ditmarschen and Hadein, which 
WW joined by Lvhsok in 194] . In a short time, the league 
increased to such a degree, that it comprised 85 towns. 
Tbty established 4 gnat fkctories abroad > namely, at 



London, Bruges, Norogorod, and Bergen in Norway, vm 
grew so powerful that they ruled by their IreMurw uw 
arms a great part of northern Europe. On one occanon 
they armed a fleet against Denmark, olT 248 â–¼eMela,aoJ 
12,000 soldiers. When the dangers of trading by iet tod 
land diminished, the league declined. The last u*^*^ 
was held at Lubeck, in 1630. The most distinpnuej 
towns in the confederacy, were Lnbecki Hamboif Â» ^ 
Bremen. These 3 cities, with Dantaic, fonned Â» M* 
league after the dlasolatkm of the Ibrmer. 



Ae'etpitt., Â» tin BÂ«at of the German Diet, mid the German emperan were crowned ben, until 
the dtMolutioa of the empire, in 1806. It is one of the most important trading towns in Ger^ 
many, and its fairs, though not what ibejr were wlien they altracffid 50,000 simmers to tbeir 
SUdb, are among the richest and most fraqueated in Europe. Frankfort contains aflveral notÂ»> 
worthj builiUHgB, collections, and institutions. Populaticm, 68,000. 



CHAPTER XLVn. THE KINGDOM OF HOLLAND, OR THE NETHKR- 
LAND8. 



1. BomiuUm4$ and EsUnt. This kingdom is bounded north by the German Ocean, east by 
Germany, south by Belgium, and west by the German Ocean. It extends from 51Â° 10*10 
S3Â° 25' N. lat., and from 3Â° 33* to 7Â° 5' E. long., and contains 13,900 square uilfls. 

S. Itlttttdt. A group of islands lie on the western coast, m the channels of which, the ira> 
ten of the Rlune, Slaeee, and Scheldt find their way to the sea. The largest are JBtierlani,

nonhern sends off a bnuich uoder the nine of 
the Yuel, into the Zuyder Zee ; aootber, called 
the Lecky to the Meuse ; a third, called lb* 
Vethtf into the Zuyder Zee, and, aTier a cmuh 
of 850 miles, enters the North Sea, below he/- 
den, a feeble stream. The Meun or J^am 
rises in France, Bod, flowing through Belgima, 
empties itself, by two principal branches, into 
the North Sea. The Scheldt enters the Neth- 
erlands from Belgium, and divides into two priih 
cipal branches, which carry its waters into dw 
Nonh Sea. 

4. Sea* and Lakei. The Zuyder Zet'at 
bu^e inland bay, in (he northern part, 60 roilei 
in extent. Tbe Sea of Haarlem is a lake, U 
miles in length, to tbe west of the Zuyder Zee, 
and communicating with it by the nver Y, 
which passes by Amsterdam. There are nuqr 
small lakes iu the northern province of Fnes- 
land. 

5. Shorei and Diket. The shores are rfr 
markabty flat and low, and a great pan of die 
country would be laid under water by the tides, 
were it not for the enormous dikes erected 
along the coast. These dikes employ ennuilly 

fUktnm^ of sAtldamd wadny U* Ntf. more men than all the com of the province w 

Holland can maintain. They are mostly 30 
feet b height, and 70 broad at the bottom. They are built of clay, faced on the land side 
with wood and stone, and toward the sea with mats of rushes and sea-weed. In North Hol- 
land, during violent storms, they cover the outsides of the dikes with sail cloth. There is â–  
board of dike commissioners, whose duty it is to superintend all tbe embankments in die 
country ; and there are many subordinate commissions all over the kingdom, who are required 
to report from time to time to the High Board the condition of the dikes in their dis^cL 
Notwithstanding all these efforts to preserve the country, the sea is still gaining on the coast. 

6. Climate. Tbe number of lakes, rivers, and canals in Holland, generate a cold and 
damp air. Chilling, northeasterly winds prevail during winter ; the Zuyder Zee is &ouii 
for several months. The weather is subject to sudden changes, and Uie climate, on the 
whole, is insalubrious. Few of the Dutch live to a great age. 

7. Soil. The soil is generally a sandy loam, sometimes mterspersed with tracts of cli^, 
but more frequently with extensive distncts of sand. Peat bogs are common. 

8. Face of thi Country. The whole country is low and flat, and was compared by Bit 
William Temple to the sea in a calm. A great part of tbe territocy is below tbe level of the 
â– ea. From the top of a steeple, the eye ranges over a boundless plain, intersected by canab 
and dikes ; meadows of the freshest verdure, covered by numerous herds of cattle ; towns, vil- 
lages, and detached houses, embosomed in trees ; nu)nerous vessels continually gliding skng 
the canals, and by the animation vihidb they give to the landscape, compensating m some de- 

See for its want of bold and picturesque beauty. In some places, low marshy tracts or shalkiW 
kes have been drained, and their former beds are fenced round with dikes ; these spots are 
called by the inhabitants poldtrt. As there is a constant filtration of water from the sea and 
rivers through the dikes, and there is no natural outlet for that which falls in rain, it becoinei 
necessary to keep these low tracts clear by artificial means. For this purpose pumps moved 
by windmills are used in great numbers, and the water is pumped out, as irom â–  leaky ship, ndO 
the rivers and canals. Hen:e, Holland has been humorously described as a countiy drawind 
60 feet of water. 

9. Dieitions. This Idngdom consists of 12 provinces ; 

North Holland, TTtrecht, Drenthe, North Brabant, 

South Holland, Oueldertand, Groningen, Limburg, 

Zealand, Overyssel, Frieiland, East Liucemburg. 



' 10. Cmob. CanA wn as ntmsnus b Hcdland ss roads b other countries, and tin coun- 
k]r is 90 lerel, tbu ther scarcelj need a lock in tbeir construction. Some of tbem are aa old 
w the lOtb ceoturr. The most noted is die Great Dutch Canaly 50 miles in length, from 
Amtnttam to the Helder. It is 134| feet wide at the surface, and 20 feet 9 inches deep.- It 
las two tide locks at the extrenuties, and two sluices with flood-oites in the intermediate space. 
Tbe width is sufficient to allow two frigates to pass each other. This cansl was begun in 1819, 
md completed in 1825, at a cost of about 4,400,000 dollars. It is highly convenient for ves- 
â– db sailing from Amsterdam, which otherwise are liable to be detained by head winds for 
Nvenl weeks. 
11. Tmmu. Ho^Mt formerly the capital of the tii^dom, situated not far from tbe sea, and 

iotersected by numerous ca- 
nals, is one of the best bulb 
cities of Europe. It con- 
uins tbe royal palace, the 
house of the States-General, 
numerous private palaces, 
&c. Population, 66,000. 
In the neighborhood, is tbe 
castle of Ryswick, where 
was concluded the celebrat- 
ed treaty of 1697. 

.Smsterdam, tbe principal 
city, and capital of the king- 
dom, and one of tbe chief 
commercial places â–  of Eu- 
rope, is a well-built town, 
upon the Amstel. It is di- 
vided by that river into two 
parts, and intersected by nu- 
merous canals, which form

diopa, filled with the producuons of all parts of the world, and tbe houses are gayly painted of 

different colors. The cil^ 
contains many literary insti* 
tutions, scientific establish- 
ments, and collections of art ; 
among the public edifices, 
the stadt-bouse, built upog 
13,600 piltfs, and nearly 300 
feet long, is the most mag- 
nificent. Amsterdam, once 
the queen of thf ocean, and 
the centre of the commerce 
of the world, is still impor- 
tant from the great wealth of 
its mercantile bouses, and 
the extent of its commercial 
operations. Its fine quays 
along the rivar Y or Wye, 
which forms its port, its vast 
naval magazines and ship* 
vards, ar.d the industry of its

12. 43gTicuUurt. The Dutch, hj unwearied 
industiy, have conquered every disadvantage of 
climate, soil, and terriioTT. The faumidiiy and 
' coldness of the air are unfavorable to the culture 
of com } the water Is equally bad ; the soil by na- 
ture produces hardly anythmg except peat, and the 
Very possession of the territory is disputed by the 
sea. Yet the labors of the pnent inhabiianis have 
converted their boggy, insigniScant territoiy into 
onÂ§ of the richest spots in Europe. The com 
raised is insufficient for home consumption, but the 
BaMmm*MAPn*ttlmenMliMd. products of the dairy are abundant; the objects of 

culture being mostly connected with pasturage. 
B7 draining the bogs and marshes, excellent meadows are created, upon which cattle liitten to 
a rast size ; tbe utmost attention is paid to their warmth and cleanliness, and even in the sum- 
mer these animals appear in tbe meadows clothed with apparendy ludicrous care, to keep off tbe 
Bies. Tue four provinces of North and South Holland, Groningen, end Utrecht, have pro- 
duced, in butter and cheese, sometimes 31,000,000 doUara annually. Holland is, indeed, one 
great meadow, intersected by canals, aad traversed by rows and groups of trees. Wheat, lye, 
barley, oats, peas, beans, and buckwheat are raised for internal consumption ; and madder, rape 
seed, bops, tobacco, clover seed, mustard seed, flax, hemp, and poppy oil, for consumpdon 
aad exportation. Much attention is paid to horticulture ; the gardens and orchards are very 
Deal. Culinary vegetables are even exported to Norway and other countries. 

13. Commerc*. Holland became at an early period a maritime power, and established set- 
tlements in various parts of the globe. The Dutch East India Company was founded in 1602, 
and its pro^erity was such, that the shares were afterwards sold at 1 ,000 per cent advance. 
Tbe manuiacniring industry of the country was one great support of its commerce, and the 
linens, sillcs, and woolens of Holland were spread over all Europe. Tbe political revolutions 
of modem times have been ruinous to the Dutch commerce ; yet the trade is still considerable, 
â– nd extends to all parts Â«f the world. The large capitals of the Dutch merchants, their central 
situation, their extensive and valuable foreign possessions, and the considerable surplus of native 
commodities for exportation, secure to them a large trade. Holland exports, besides its own 
produce above mentioned, the faerring, stockfish, whalebone, and oil furnished by its fisheries ; 
(be coSee, sugar, rum, cotton, and spices of its colonies ; the gin and tobacco-pipes of its manu- 
factories, and several articles of German produce and manufacture. Much of the commerce is 
carried on by native vessels. Vast floats of timber are received by the Rhine from Switzer- 
land and Germany. 

14. Manufacturu. The manufactures of Holland have been greatly checked by the rival- 
ship of the English. Before the French revolution, iher^ was scarcely a manufacture which tbe 
Dulcfa did not carry on. In this they were assisted by the populousness of the country, the 
cheapness of labor, and, above all, by tbe water carriage, which gives an immense fiusili^ to all

woolen, linen, silk, cotton, tobacco, snuff, pipes, leather, be. The dislillaiion of gin is lirgd; 
carried on. 

15. Fuheriet. The herring fishery has been prosecuted on a large scale fay the Dutch, em 
since the 12th century ; the art of curing and barreling these fish was discovered here in 1316. 
In the middle of the 18th century, the faiisiness employed 100,(X)0 fishermen. This biisiiiess ii 
still very considerable though greatly declined from what it used formerly to be. The nhile 
Gsbery )S aim prosecuted, but on a small scale, and wiili liule success. 

16. Inhabitimti. The Dutch are hardy, and can endure much labor and fatigue. Tbi 
complexion of the females is not to be surpassed In clearness, but their forms are not univeruDf 
distinguished for lightness. There are some Germans and Jews settled in Holland. The no- 
bility are numerous, but not always rich. 

17. Dress- The national dress is not much liable to the fluctuation of fashion ; it is netrff 
the same as it was in the lime of the duke of Alva. People of the higher class folloDtlit 
French fashions, but the peasantry dress in a peculiar manner. The men have jackets, uxl 



Vatagtr Â«f OuiUtrt. Cmmtrymma* tf Guddtrt. Bridt qf Marteit, 

breeches of great capaciousness ; they wear many huge buttons on their dress, and both seie^ 
bare wooden shoes. The females in common life wear close caps and long-waisted gowns ; 
the female peasantry wear short petticoats with very long waists, and their dress is much padded 
and stuffed. There are many different costumes in the different districts. 

18. Langwage. The general and written language is the Dutch, which is derived from vx 
German ; the Frisian is a dialect of the Dutch, used in some of the northern parts. The 
Dutch merchants generally are familiar with several languages. 

19. JWonnÂ«r ofBvilding. The architecture of the cities b neat and imposing ; the endi 
of the houses are oflen placed towards the street, and the walls are filled with ornaments. Th( 
country bouses are stiff and formal ; they have frequently a motto over the gateway or front. 
The new buildings are few, but many old ones bear over their doors the date of [he Ulli or 
15tb century. The 1st of May is the time when tenants remove from bouses ; a practice coid- 
mon in New York, and which has there a Dutch derivation. At the windows in cities, m 
large glasses, so placed at angles with others, that tbey reflect the passengers in the street lo 
the unobserved scrutiny of the parlor. 

20. Food and Drink. A great pert of the food of the common people consists in potaioei, 
nit meat, and fisb. The garden vegetables are excellent and duDdaiu. Raw po b a unirerw

bererage, and takes the place of cider or beer, though some beer is used. Tbe Dutch, bow- 
erer, from a phl^matic tempersinent, and from the humidity of tbe climate, can take much 
ipirits without injury ; they are not an intemperate people. No sign is more frequent over sbops 
than that of tobacco, for no Dutchman is long without his pipe. Even the females of the corn- 
iDoa class are addicted to smoking ; the rooms of a public oouse, or of a trektchuyt^ are filled 
with the thickest smoke, from never-dying pipes, which, says Professor Silliman, the Dutch 
"mainuin, with vestal vigilance, under their noses." 

21. Diatatts. The diseases of Holland are not peculiar, though rheumatism and the maW 
dies of a humid climate ere common. 

%%. Traotling. Posting is less expeditions and convenient than in France ; but the roada 
â– re not more numerous than tbe canals, and a general method of traveling is, therefore, by tbe 
tnlachvyt, or drag-boat ; this is 10 feet wide, and 50 long ; and in shape it resembles tba 
common representations of Noah's ark. The expense does not exceed three cents a mile, and 
the rate of traveling is three miles an hour, which is so invariably the result, that distances, as 
in the East, are reckoned by hours, and not hy miles. When frozen, the canals are traveled 
over hy sleighs and skates. All persons skate ; the peasant girl skates to market, with her 
merchandise on her head, the senator to his assembly, and the clergyman to his church. 

33. CKaracUr, Manntrt, and Cvstonu. If we estimate the national character from the de- 
â– criptions of the English, we should do it injustice ; for the commercial islanders are never just 
â– o commercial competilors, and the Dutch have often been their successful rivals. The Dutch 
â– re distir guished fcr frugality, neatness, and industry ; they are of a cold, phlegmatic tempera- 
ment, but, when roused to passion, have as much ardor as any people. They are grave and 
heavy in appearance, and even children are sedate. They are quiet and domestic, and Bnjoy 
nnch happiness in their family circles. Generally ihey prefer gain to ambition, but in iheir 
dealings they are honest. The very soil they till is a monument of their perseverance and in- 
dustry ; they live in a country of meadows reclaiined from the sea, and tbe acquisition is main- 
tiined only by continual vigilance, toil, and expense. In Holland, neatness is carried to ex- 
cess ; in their kitchens, eiery metallic utensil is as bright as scouring can make it, and hung 
upon tlie walls for show, for neatness here is ostentatious ; the very tongs and shovel are " hung 
op for monuments.'* The principal utensils are of pewter and copper. One room in tbe 
hooie is held too sacred for common intrusion ; and the neatness and arrangement of this, is a 
paculiar study. In some of the villages, wagons are aot permitted to pass tbroi^ the streeta ; 



* â–  

the fcpDt walks are scnAbed, saoded, and mariced out in iaocifbl figures. The iotm toi 
porcoes are burnished, and the trees that shade them do not escape the brush. Little adnil* 
taace is granted at the front door ; and even at the back entrance, a shoe not perfecdy sati^ 
toiy to the genius of the place, must be laid aside^ and a slipper, which is kept Â£or thb purpost^ 
worn during the visit. 

The Dutch are profuse of time, but economical of money. All then* conveyances, by set 
or land, are slow, and ^^ Dutch speed," has grown into a saying for tardiness. The ecoBonj, 
however, is not to be discovered in the public establishments, which are on a princely scale. 

24. Amusements. The principal of the peculiar amusements of the Dutch are skadng, and 
dancing at the licensed houses, where the most infamous class resort. It is common, for stiid 
and respectable people, in family grotqps, to mingle in the dance, with those who have neitfaer 
character nor modesty to lose.^ Skating is followed by both sexes ; it is a graceful and health- 
ful amusement. The females are generally dressed in white, and each one is attended by a 
man ; generally they ;nove with each a hand resting on the other's shoulder. They step siniiil- 
taneously, as in marching. It is an interesting spectacle, to see many females, with flond com- 
plexions, and dressed m white, moving swiftly, and apparently without effort, like Camillai 

^ When, like a paMilif tliofight, she fled 
In light, away." 

25. Educcttion. There are 3 universities ; one at Leyden, another at Groningen, and a 
third It Utrecht. There are several athenaeums or gymnasiums, and many high schools. 
There are elementary schools in all towns and villages, and there are m many places meobanic 
kntitutions. 

26. State of the Jtrts, Sciences^ and Literature. Painting, only, has been cultivated with 
great success ; and the Dutch School is distinguished by the most faithful and exact imitatiob 
of nature. The greatest painters are Rembrandt, Wouvermann, Gerhard Douw, Ruisdael, 
Mieris, Ostade, &c. Erasmus was the great restorer of literature in the West, and Grotios is 
t great name in jurisprudence, theokgy, history, &c. The Dutch, however, have little Ktera- 
ture, though they have done much for the sciences. Many of their most popular boob, are 
imitations of English, French, en* German authors. 

27. Rel^ion. This is Protestant, and in the Calvinistic form. The church govemmeot is 
somewhat similar to that of Scotland. There are many Walloon churches, belonging to Flem- 
ish Protestants, who have a Synod of their own. There are, besides, Lutherans, Baptists, 
Jews, Quakers, Arroinians, and Greeks. The Sabbath is observed in many places, nearly as 
strictly as in New England. 

38. Chvemment. The government is a constitutional monarchy ; the crown is hereditaiy 
iti the house of Nassau Orange. The two legislative chambers are styled the States-General; 
the upper house is composed of members nominated by the king for life, like the Chamber of 
'Peers m France, and the lower bouse consists of deputies chosen by the provincial estates, ar 
boat assemblies of the 3 orders or estates of the reahn ; viz. the nobility, the citizens, and the 
hiidholders. 

29. Colonies. The Dutch colonies, thoua;h less extensive than formerly, are still impoitaat, 
comprising a population of nearly 10,000,000. They are the Islands of Curacao^ BonJ^j 
Arvba^ St Euslitins, Saba, and part of SL Martin' Sy with Surinam^ in America ; a number 
of forts and factories on the coast of the Gulf of Guinea, in Africa ; and the islands of Java, 
Cdebes, Timor, the Moluccas, &c., with settlements in Sumatra and Borneo. In these two 
islands, particularly the latter, the Dutch are constantly pushing their conquests, so as to brit^ 
more and more of the native inhabitants under their rule. In Java they have given, of lata 
jrears, a great extension to agriculture, particularly in the production of su^ar and coffee. 

30. Population, &c. The population of Holland in 1848, was 3,236,741. Public reveooe 
Mid expenditure about $28,000,000 annually. The Public debt is upwards of $400,000,OOa 

The army hitherto kept up amounts to upwards oi 40,000 men in time of peace ; 70.000 
meo in time of war. Besides the soldiers of the regular army there is a militia known as Scbut- 
tÂ»rs, formed by an enrollment in all places the population of which amounts to 2,500. The 
Soiiattery may be termed the Dutch Nat'tonal Guard, and the call of these troops gives tbe kiog 
of Holland 29 battalions, or 40,000 men. They are called at tbe pleasure of the king only^ but 
tbe Landsturm, which is a levy en masses can be made under do consideration but by conaeat 
â€¢f the Chambers.

Tba Dutch nirj is powerful, consisting of 99 fmXta mdditps of dw liiM, SO canetlH ud

31. Hutorjf. A portion of this country was occupied, a century before ifae Christian en, 
hj a barbarous tribe called Batavi, who gare tbe name of Batavia to their terrltoiy. Thwr 
Ml under the Roman power ; and their country was united to Germany in the 9th century. tÂ» 
lbs 15th century, tbe 17 proriBces of tbe Netherlands, or, as tbe name signifies, ibe Low 
CouRtries, belonged to the dukes of Burgundv, but passed by marriage into the hands of tha 
Spanish Ivanch of the House of Austria, ^he attempt of Philip the Second, kii^ of Spain, 
to crash tbe Protestant religion in the Low Countries, gave rise to a revolt of those pnivinoes, 
wad, after a long and heroic struggle, the 7 northern provinces achiered their independence. 
la l&Sl they renounced tbeir allegiance (o Philip, and formed tbe republic of tae United 
ProTtnces of the Netherlands, often simply called Holland, from the name of the most exten- 
Biva and powerfiil province. The war of independence was coolinued, however, wiffi inter- 
raptions, until tbe peace of Westphalia, in 1648. With liberty came industry, foreign com- 
iDercÂ«, wealth, and power, and during the 17lh century, Holland was one of the fii^t Luropeaa 
States. After the French revolution, the Netherlands were conquered by France, and, in 
1810, incorporated with the French empire. On the fall of Napoleon, in 1815, the Bdgic and 
Dotcb Netberiands were united together as an independent kingdom, under the Dutch stsdt- 
holdar, bst in 1830, tbe former provinces revolted, and now form tbe kingdom of Belgium. 



CHAPTER XLVni. BELGIUM. 



1 . Botmdttfitt and Extent. This kingdom is bounded north by Holland, east by Germany, 
southwest by France, and northwest by the German Ocean. It extends from 49Â° 40* to 51Â° 
SO N. lat., and from 2^ 40* to 6^ E. long., and comprises 12,570 square miles. 

2. Riven. The chief rivers are the Scheldt and Maete. The Scheldt rises in France. 
and 6ows northeasterly into this countiy, where it turns to the north and northwest, and, di 
ridiDg into several channels, falls into the German Ocean, Though not remarkable for length, 
it is a wide and deep river. Antwerp and Ghent are situated upon it. The J^aest, or JUeute, 
flows through the eastern part of the country from France to Holland. 

3. FoTMls. There are many large forests in the districts of Namin" and Liege, and along 
ihe French frontier, being the remains of the celebrated forest of .Srduenna or ^rdtnnet. tn 
Brabant is the forest of Soignieg. They consist mostly of beech, birch, elm, and otk, and are 
med principally for fuel. Most of the trees fit for timber have been cut down. 

4. CliiMtt, Stnl, &c. The climate much resembles that of Ihe south of England. In the 
interior the air is salubrious ; but upon the coast of Flanders, and about (he mouths of tbe 
Scheldt, the air is moist and unhealthy. The soil, in general, resembles that of Hdlland. In 
Li^e and Kamur are considerable stony and unproductive tracts. Flanders abounds with ez- 
celleni com lands. In the south and souiheaslern parts are mines of iron, lead, copper, and 
eoaJ, and -quarries of marlle. The whole country is low and level, but-somettiat Ins to kkta 
Htdhnd. In the south are some bills of tnoderate heighL

6. Gaiait. The canals of Belgium are numnDus, spacioui, ind commodious, though nMenil 
m number to those of Holland, coonecling all ihe greut dlies, and uniting every viUÂ«t{e. Tbt 
Great North Cunal extends across the country from Antwerp to Venloo on ihe Ueew, I3D 
miles. The Brussels Caaal connects Bni.isels and Antwerp, 60 miles. The Ostend CtoL 
passing through Bruges, connects Ghent with the sea at Ostend, whence it is continued to Dn- 
kirk. Brussels is also connected with Mons and Cliarleroi by canals. 

7. Railroads. These works were projected by King Leopold, who adopted the esti^hnd 
policy of undertaking a great public work. Tor the encouragement of industry, the â– cmployDXDt 
of labor, for strengthening, consolidating, and enriching the country, and to serve as a monuniai 
of his devotedness to the interest of the Slate. He ordered the whole country lo be samjti 
by able engineers, the necessary plans and estimates fornied, and, on the 1st of May, I834,i 
law was proclaimed, for the introduction of a system of railroads, through the whole kin)^n,ii 
difiereot directions, to be executed at the expense of the slate. These railroads lead to setpm 

. at t*To points, â€” Antwerp and Ostend, â€” connect with France at two, aud with Germany atone; 
and all unite in one centre. The road extending to the frontier of Gennany, has been continaed 
to Cologne on ihe Rhine, Antwerp thus becomes the post of the Rhenish provinces. Tlie Bel- 
gium roads, thus far, have proved eminently successful. 

8. Cities. Bmsiela, the capital, stands on both sides of the little river Senne, flowing iikd 
the Scheldt. It Is partly situated on a rising ground, and makes a fine appearance at a disuoce. 
The city was formerly surrounded by a double wall and ditch, but these have been dcnioliibed, 
and the space formed into a handsome public walk planted with trees. The suburbs are eiten- 
â– ive, and there are many neighboring villages joined to the city by long aveoues. The kmer 
pan of the town consists of narrow streets and old houses. The upper part Is modem mi 
regular, with fine buildings and a beautiful park laid out in large, regular walks, shaded vii^ 
trees and stirrounded by palaces, public offices, and elegant private houses. Public founniDi 
are interspersed throughout the city, and a large canal here leaves the river. The Hotel it

distinguished for its manufactures of iaces, carpets, tapestry woolen and cotton clotbÂ«, silk 
stockings, gold and silver lace, and earthem ware. Population 165,000. WaterloOy about 
lO miles from Brussels, and on the borders of the Soignies Forest, is a small villaa;e, near 
which the fate of Ekirope was decided, in the year 1815, by the victory of the Allies over 
Napoleon. 

Antwerp^ on the Scheldt, is a large and well built-city, surrounded by a wall with carriage- 
roads on the top, planted with rows of trees. The city is built in the form of a semicircle and 
is intersected by canals. The cathedral is one of the firtest Gothic structures in the world, 
and its spire is unrivalled ; it is 441 fe^t high, and deserves, according to the sayings of Charles 
die Fifth, to be kepi in a glass case and shown only on holydays. The stadt-house and exchange 
are noble edifices. The harbor is deep and capacious. In the height of its prosperity, Ant- 
werp ^as one of the most flourishing and wealthy commercial cities in the world, and contained 
SO0,000 inhabitants. Its commerce has greatly declined, and the city has a decayed and 
solitary appearance. Na|)oleon designed to make it a great naval station, and constructed here 
soune of the noblest dockyards in the world. The inhabitants carry on a few manufactures. 
PopulatioM 80,000. 

Ghent stands at the confluence of 3 rivers with the Scheldt, and is seven miles in compass, but 
contains within its walls many fields and unoccupied grounds. Many of its canals are bordered 
with quays planted with rows of trees. The houses are large, but heavy and Inelegant ; here is 
a fine Gothic cathedral whh marble floors and pillars. Ghent has manufactures of fine lace, 
cotton, linen, woolen, silk, paper, and leather; the trade of the city has lately increased. 
Population, 90,000. Its citadel is one of the largest in Europe. The ti^aty of Peace between 
Great Britain and the United States was negotiated here, in 1815. 

BrugeSy eight miles from the sea, stands in a fertile plain, it communicates with the sea and 
the towns in the interior by canals. Here are a college, yi academy for painting, sculpture, and 
architecture, several literary societies, a public library, and a botanical garden. The manu- 
fiicture of lace employs 6,000 people ; and there are 200 schools in which children are taught 
this art. Tlie town-house is a superb public edifice ; its steeple is furnished with chimes of 
bells, which play a diflferent tune every quarter of an hour. Population 45,000. It was for- 
merly one of the great commercial marts of the world, but is now much declined, yet its com- 
merce, manufactures, and extensive ship-yards render it still important. Osiettdy a few miles 
west of Bruges, is one of the most important seaports in the country ; regular packets sail from 
this place to England several times a week, and it has a great trade b the exportation of grain 
and other products. Population 12,554. 

Liefffy on the Maese, is divided into three parts by the river and has extensive suburbs. The 
houses are high and many of the streets narrow, crooked, and gloomy. Most of the inhabitants 
are engaged in manufactures and trade. Iron, coal, and alum abound in the neighborhood, and 
affi>rd occuimtion for all the industry of the place. The manufactures consist of iron, fire-anns, 
clock-work, nails, &c. Population 73,000. Liege contains a university and numerous institu- 
tions of education and learned societies. 

Toumay, the principal manufacturing town in the kingdom, is a flourishing place with 33,000 
inhabitants; carpets,' camlets, and porcelain, are among the principal products of its industry. 
MfrtiSy the capital of Hainault, is noted (or the extensii'e coal mines in its neighborhood. Pop- 
ulation 24,000. 

LouvaiUy with 35,000 inhabitants, is an active manufacturing town, with a celebrated univer- 
sity. NuvMify capital of the province of the same name, is rendered important by its manufac- 
tures of cutlery, leather, and earthernware, its extensive fortifications, and its population of 
25,000 souls. 

JUalines or Meehlhu with 26,000 inhabitants, YprtSy 15,000, and Caurtrayy with 16,000, 
are among the other, most considerable towns. The portion of Limburg assigned to Belgium, 
has no towns of importance. 

9. Agriculture. The agriculture of the Belgic provinces forms the principal source of their 

wealth. The whole territory of Flanders is cultivated like a garden. A great proportion con- 

, nsted originally of harsh, barren sands, producing nothing but heath and fir; yet by the applica-, 

tioo of manure, these have been brought into a state of high fertility. The culture of artificial

10. Commerce and Manufaeturet. In the Ulb centuiy the Flemish were one of tbs nM 
commercial and manufacturing people of Europe. Bruges, and, Bftervards, Antwerp, tM 
the centres of an extensive commerce, which finally passed mostly into the bands of tin Datei' 
Manufacturing industry is the branch in which the Belgic provinces formerly most exceJIed ai 
in which their decay is most conspicuous. Three centuries ago the linens and voolens oi 
Ghent, Louvain, Brussels, and Mechlin, clothed the higher ranlu in all the surrounding cov- 
Iries. Since that time, the fabrics of France and England have attained such a superioritji w 
are at once so cheap and so well suited to the taste of the age, that the Low Countries' nMi- 
"factures cannot sustain a competition. There are still, however, some fine linen fabrics, lict^ 
lawns, and cambrics, in which they continue unrivaled. The linens (^ Flanders, tlie ^^ 
Brussels and Mechlhi, the woolens of Verviers and Mecbim, the sffloking-pipes of Gondt,*" 
the cutlen^ and faardnnre of Namur and Liege, are among the products of Belgian indmtir-

13. State of the ^rtt, Slc. The fine arts were cultivated with great zeal and succcm in tbe 
Belgic provinces, during the days of their opulence and prosperity. Wealthy merchants Kbenlly 
patronized the arts of design ; and the gentry and landholders being induced by tbe constant 
wais, of which the Low Countries were the tbeatre, to live much, in towns, acquired mors fo- 
fined tastes, than could have been formed in a country life- Antwerp, during its prospeioui 
period, became, in some measure, a Belgic Athens. Tbe Flemish school of painting, under 
Its great masters Rubens and Vandyke, displayed great splendor of coloring, grandeur of com- 
position, and force of expression, allhough it never reached that grandeur of design and pure 
taste, which were formed in Italy. 

13. Religion and Education. The Belgians are mostly Catholics, the number c^ ProteÂ»- 
tanls not exceeding 10,000. The Catholic clergy have shown a very intolerant spirit here, but 
(be great possessions of the church have been forleited, and the monasteries have been suppress- 
ed, only a few nunneries having been allowed to exist. The clei^ now receive very mods- 
rate saliries from government ; they consist of an Archbishop of Mechlin, 5 bishops, M vicart- 
general and canons, and 4,S30 inferior officers. There are 4 uuversities, and tbe prtvikion for 
{enecÂ«I education is extensive. 

14. Government. Tbe form of government is monarchical, and tbe power of the king it 
EmJted by tbe constitmion. There are 3 legislative chambers, both elected by the citisaupay

ing a certain tax ; the Senate is chosen for the tenn of 8, ind the House of Bq 

for 4 years. Tite population of Belgium is 4,500,000. 

15. IS$tory. The bistoTT' of Belgium is connected with that of Holland till tha reroh of 

the latter country from the Spanish dominion. Beigium or the Low Countries renuined in ihi 
s after the independence of Holland. Early in the 18lh centuij tli> 
ids of the Austrians, and was held by them till the breaking out of

vr of Napoleon, it was united to Holland, and formed a part of iIm 
a. This union was the work of the Congress of Vienna, and nmi 
escence of the Belgians. The two nations differed in chutdv, 
on, and language, and the policy of William of Orange, who ocn- 
im conciliatory. The Belgians were treated more as a cunqumd 
an equality wiib the Dutch ; few of them were appointed to ifflpa^

CHAPTER XLIX. DENMARK. 

â– 1, Boundariu tmd Extent. Denmark is a peninsula, divided oa tbe north from Nonwbf 
d>e Scagerac, and from Sweden on the east by the Sound ; it is bounded on tbe south far Gtr 
taiany and the Baltic ; and the Oennan sea divides it from Great Britab on tbe west, hciud- 
ing tbe insular portion, it lies between 53Â° 21' and 57Â° 42* north latitude, and SÂ° and 13Â° SO* 
east longitude. Its length from north to south is nearly 300 miles, and its breadth 100. Ate*i 
33,000 square miles. 

3. Jtieers. The most considerable river is the Eyder, which, rising near tbe Baltic, nun 
wenw&rd, and after a course of 66 miles, falls into the German sea at Tonningen. Tbe 
Ovdemttl has its source between Skanderboi^ and Banders, and enters tbe Baltic at Radbjre- 

â– The other rivers, or more properiy, rivulets, are numerous ; but too inconsiderable to requin 
mention. 

S. Laket. There are several lakes, but none of any magnitude. That of Plotn, in Ho)- 
tteiD, is one of the largest, and does not exceed 10 miles in circumference. Among tbe otb- 
ers are those of ^rre, Etrom, and Sial, in Zealand ; the lake of Wyhorg and the Lai^ ln^ 
in Jutland ; and the lake of Ralztbwg in Lauenburg. 

4. IsUmli. The islands in the BaTiic are the most fertile and populous parts of the king- 
dom, and of these Zealand is the largest. It is generally flat, and except in a small part of tl)' 
coast very little elevated above the level of tbe sea. It contains 2,700 square miles. Popub- 
â– tion 48,000. Funen, the next in importance, is separated from Zealand by the strait, cjlW 
the <lreal Bell, and is about 50 miles long and 40 broad. The populaiion is 154,000. TIk 
island of Bombolm is surrounded by rocks highly dangerous to navigators, and coniains seta 
towns and twenty-one parishes. The capital is Roenne, known for its potteries and naich iÂ«i 
clock making. Poptilulion of the island 25,000. The little isle of Moen, at tlie souibetn 
extremity of Zealand, contains 12,000 iiibabiiants. Tlie island of Langeland, between Tam 
and Laaland, contains 16,000 inhabitants. Laaland, or Lolland, is peopled by 50,000, Bn4^ 
a considerate trade in grain. The isle of Falster, to tbe east of Laaland, numbers 21mP 
inhabitants. Sanuoe has 6,000 Taasinge, 4,000, Alsen, 23,000, Aeroc and Fenem, ^f^ 
each. .'"^ 

5. Bayt, S'rotf*, fyc. The coasts of Denmark are indented by numerous branches ofW 
sea, ca.\\ed Jiordt, or Grihs, the principal of which is called hymjiord. The Soui'tl, or On^mt^ 
one of the three simits which connect the Caiiegat and Baltic, is die most frequented stiAv 
the world. Its depth is from ten to nineteen fiitlioiiis; but close upon tlie coast, and nwt 
some of the ialaodi, it ii only iijur fiithoma. 



. 9. Oh m nf . Tbe gMgraphtctl situatioD or Denmwli indicKtai aereritjr of climate ; but Uw 
rmnty of the sea renders the air more huoiid aod temperate than id the ioterior of tin cooii- 
onl ia the same latitude. The sky is oftea obscured hy fogs, and raio falls at least on odÂ» 
third v( the whole Dumber of days in the year. The summer is often oppressively warm, it 
beg^Dj in June, and ends with September. 

7. Soil. The prevaiiing soil is sandy. In some pans it consists of a very rich mould, of 
which ibe compoDent substanoes are marl, aad a bituminous matter. Tbe soil in tbe island of 
AJsea is ehiei^ composed of a very rich vegetable mould. Marshes are foimd everywhere.; ThÂ« 
whole of Veodsyssal is one continuous marsh. Some fuller's earth, alum, and vitriol, found â– â€¢ 
Jotbad, Bad porcelain clay obiaiued in the island of Bomholm, seem to constitute the whole of 
ibe mineral productiuis of Denmark. 

8. â€¢flntmab. Deer, foxes, aod hares are numerous, and hunting is a common amusement. 
Sea-fowl abound in the marshy dbtricts. The horses of Denmark and Holstein are celebrated 
lor thdr strength, beauty, and speed. 

9. Face of tlu Country. Tbe general surface of Denmark is level, with slight undulations. 
Tbe coasts are in some parts steep, and bold ; but usually low and sandy. Towards the westi 
where the Jutland peniasula terminates, tbe aspect of tbe country is exceedingly barreo and 
desolate. 

10. DieiMon$. Denmark is divided into 3 parts, the firs) comprehending the kingdom of 
Deamark Proper ; tbe second tbe 3 duchies of Sleswick, Holstein, and Lauenburg, which htr 
loD^ to tbe German confederation ; and the third embracing^tbe Feroe Islands, and Iceland, 
which are considered as foreign colonies. The kingdom of Denmark consists of the peoinndl 
of Jutland, and the islands contiguous. 

11. Canab. By the canal of Kiel, a communication is maintained between tbe Germea 
Ocean and tbe Baltic. The canal of Steckenitx, uniies tbe I)lhe with the Baltic. The caoil 
of Odensee unites Odensee with the sea. 

IS. T'otMi*. Copenkagen, called by the Danes JRohenltmny the metropolis of tbe Daoiab 
doDiinions, is situated on a low and marshy promontoiy on tbe east aide of the island of Zea> 
land. Its harbor is excellent, and its quays and dock-yards extensive. Tbe regularity of iU 
dieets, the beauty of its squares, and the great number of its el^;ai)t buildings, render Copen- 
b^en one of the liandsomest cities in Europe. Tbe royal castle of Chtistiansborg is a mag* 
nificeot palace with a rich gallery of paintings, and a fine library of 400,OUO volumes. Thm 
ne 3 other royal palaces, and many fine palaces of tbe nobility. The halls of tlie univeraityf 
tbe town-house, and numerous other public edifices are distinguished for the beauty of their ar- 
chitecture. Amon^ tbe churches are that of Our Lady, adorned with some pieces of statuaiy 
by Tborwaldsen, and that of the Trinity, tbe round tower of which, used as an observatory, 
cu be ascended by a winding path in carriages. No city of its size surpasses Copenhagen m 
dte Dumber and excellence of its learned societies, its scientific establishments, and its institu- 
lions for education. The university has a good library of 100,000 volumes, aod enjoys a higk 
reputation. Copenhagen is tlie centre of an active commerce and of flourisliing manufactKres, 
â€¢od it contains a population of 125,000. Its vast docks and its massive and extensive fortifi> 
cations, are worthy of notice. 
^wrick, the capital of the ducby of that name, is a long, irregular, but handsome town, 
with 12,000 inhabitants. ^Uona, on the 
Elbe, aboiit 2 miles from Hambui^, is Â« 
place of considerable trade, and extensive 
manufactures. Population, 32,000: EH' 
nore, or Elnnettr, at the narrowest part 
of the Sound, is protected by the strong 
fortress of Cronborg, and contains about 
30 commercial houses. It bos an excellent 
roadstead, in which ships anchor almost 
close to the loWn. At this place the tolls 
of tbe Sound are collected. Population, 
7,000. Kiely tbe capital of Holstein, is a 
fortified town on a bay of the Baltic, and 
is tbe seat of a celebrated university. Foi^

Â«fteat, Mts, bock-nrbeat, and peas. A great quantity of excrilaM butter is mannnctand 
Tbe rearing of cattle is aJso an extensive branch of incjustiy, and tbe rich meadows of Sith

poultry are plentiful, particu'arly geese and ducks, the feathers of which are a Taluable aitidi 
â€¢f expmlatiDD. 

14. Oommtrce, This country is well situated for commerce. The piincipal imports m 
eotton, tea, wine, brandy, and salt. The exports are timber, black cattle, bones, aiock-ldt, 
Mifew, bides, tar, pitch, and iron, with some produce. 

' li. Jifatuifactwu. There are a few hoods employed in tbe manufacture of vooko sliA. 
Chfpets, stockings, gloves, camlets, and lace, are alao made to sonae extent. Sugar refiDeriai 
ire common, and the produce is equivalent to the consumptioc. 

10. Fiiluriti, The moat considerable fishery is that of berriogs in the Lynfiord. Seili 
â€¢ad porpoises are killed upon tbe coast and in the Eider. 

17. Revenue and Papulation. The annual revenue of Deanark ia 8,000,000 doaats. Ii 
adsaa prificipaUy Irom the royal demesnes, tithes, land tajt, poll tax, a tax upon titles, placM, 
â– ad pensions, stamp duties, customs, and a toll on vessels passing the Sound. Tbe public 
Mm is 601,000,000 dolhrs. The population of tbe Daniab dominions is 3^50,000, beiidg 
1NIO,000 in the colonies. 

18. Jlrmy and JVatiy. Tbe present military force of Denmark crasists of 24,619 ncn. 
TW Daniab navy amooDts to 7 ships of the line, 3 frigates, 6 skwps of 30 guns, 5 brip, 3 

>Â«oboo[ier3, 82 gunboats, and 4 stewnboats. The Danes are expert teaxaeci. 

19. CoJoNWa. Tbe Faroe Itlandt lie between Iceland and the Shetland isles. Thoy ctaaA 
â€¢I SS islands, 17 of which are inhabited, tbe rest being mere rocks. Tbear supeifietal axUil 
Ion been estinutedatl,I003quare miles ; and the number of inhabitants at 9,600. The whok 
Â«f these isUmds are composed of basaltic rocks ; aod some of tbe mountains rise to tbe bNgh 
â€¢f 3,000 feet above the level of the sea. In Osleroe is a range of basaltic pillars, abnoil n 
Ngularly defined as those of Slaf%. The principal minerals are copper, jasper, and cnL 
Xie climate is rigorous. Trees are unknown, and the only fruit is wild berries. Cows of i 
â€¢mil breed, and sheep form tbe principal wealth of the inhabitants. Tbe tsUnders are lup- 
ported chtedy by bird-catcbuig and fisliing ; the seal fishery in ihe montb of September beiiK 
Â«Acn very productive. They manufacture a few jackets, and upwards of 112,000 piin of 
atodtings annually, which tliey exchange with the Danes for grain, timber, nails, coSee, salt, vti 
9tber necessaries. Tbe Ftroe Islands were discovered and colonized by fugitive NoraiaDi,be- 
Iweea tbe years 658 and 868. During the American war tbey became notorious for smuig^i 
â– nd continued so for some time. Tbe language is a Danish dialect of the Norse. Tbe iobuiwnii 
an a labMioua and simple race of meo, and their ordinary food is barley, milk, &sh, &c. 

The other colonies of Denmark, wsides Iceland, are ibe 
Nicobar Islands in Asia, Tranquebar and Seram)K)re, in laik, 
were sold to the Bniisli in 1845. There are also llie forlt ol

Africa J tbe selttemenls of Greenland in North America ; ni 'h* 
islands of St. Thomas, St. Croix, and St. John in the WÂ« 
Indies. 

20. InJiabilanti. The Danes, like most nprlhem miioiu, 
are fair in complexion, of middle statue, and hardy in caraiiiu* 
tion. The women have bitie eyes and nubuni liair, and nÂ»a]r 
of them are beautiful. There is a nobility, which tlioog'i Â«â–

The Ctermans oocwpj Holsteb, Lubeek, aod the most of Sleswick, and there are a few Gyp* 
â€¢M. The woiBen of the midcDe ohsses are very fond of show in their dress, which is C0QÂ»- 
posed of many colors, red being the most prevalent. In sunmi^, many of the people r^aii 
tbeir great-coats, and hd winter they assume furs. The Fraich fashions are common in the 
dd^. The Danish language is a dialect of the Gothic, or old German. The Frisish ia used is 
some of the islands, and the German in Hobtein, Lubec, and a part of Sleswick. The housea 
ta the cities are generally of brick ; in the country, they are of wood, with piazzas ; few of them 
haro much pretension to degance. The general food of the lower class is oat*cake, lye* 
bvead, potatoes, fish, and cheese. Much beer and spirits, chiefly brandy, are consumed, and 
die me of tobacco is general, but less so than in Germany. 

The mode of traveling is less convenient than in Germany, and few foreigners vbit Den* 
fliark. The common post vehicles do not exceed 4 or 5 miles an hour. The Dtmes are 
breve, but not adventurous. They would do more for defence than for glory. They are leaf 
cordial than the Germans, and less cheerful than their northern neighbors. They are faitbfid 
and honest, but not strongly marked with national peculiarities. They are addicted to the use 
of spirituous liquors, and the proverbial expression of a ^' drunken Dane," has some founds 
tion in the national character. 

The Danes are much less cheerful than either the Swedes or die Norwegians. Cards and 
dancing are the most common amusements, but these are not followed with much spirit. 

21. EdHcoHon. There is a university at Copenhagen, and another at KieL There are many 
gymnasiums, and every town has a primary school ; 2,302 of these schools are on the LaDcae* 
terian plan. The nobility are educated at Scroa. There is a school at Copenhagen for the 
instruction of teachers, and there are several learned societies. The bluest Ubravy haa 
410,000 volumes^ of which 30,000 are of a date prior to 1500. There are 80 periodic 
pfablications in Denmark, 70 of which are in Danish. 

22. State of the Jtrtfj Sciences^ and Literature. The arts are not in a flourishing state, 
tbougb Thor\valdsen, the sculptor, was by birth a Dane. The ancient literature is the SIcandk 
navian, which will be mentioned under another head. In the 12tb century, Saxo Grammaticua 
wrote his Danish history. Holberg and Pontoppidan were Danes, and Malta Brtm was bom 
m Denmark. The sciences are cultivated with success, but the literature is limited. Tbeae 
are some popular songs, and good dramas. 

23. Religion. The religion is chiefly Lutheran, and the church government partakes of the 
English hierarchy, and of the Calvinlstic discipline. Few of the clergy have livings of more 
than $ 1800, or less than $ 250 a year. In Jutland, however, some have but $ 130. There 
ere a few nunneries. 

24. Government and Latos. The government is an hereditary and unlimited monarchy.' 
Bat though the king has power to make, interpret, and abrogate the laws, there is much practi* 
eal freedom. The laws are equitable, and justly administered. The police is strict. 

25. History. Denmark, Norway, and Sweden, were ancientlv called Scandinacia. A 
century before the Christian era, the inhabitants of the peninsula of Jutland were known te tbo 
Romans by the name of the Cimbri. The Gothic conquerors gave this country a new set of 
rulers. In the Middle Ages, these people, with the Swedes and Norwegians, were called 
^fbrmansy or Northmen. They conquered Normandy in France, peopled the Faroe Islands, 
the Orkneys, Shetland, and Iceland, yid carried their arms into the south of Europe. Canute, 
king of Denmark, conquered in the lith century, the wliole of Norway, and nearly all England 
and Scotland. Under this prince, Christianity was introduced ; and the progress of civilization 
begun. But the most brilliant era was the reign of Margaret, sumamed the Northern Semira-' 
mis, who eflected the union of Calmar, which placed on her head the crown of Denmark, 
Norway, and Sweden, in the 14th century. Sweden, however, shook oflT the Danish yoke in 
the 16th century, but Norway was retained until 1815, when it was ceded to Sweden, under 
die dictation of the allied armies.

tbe middle of which is the bigliest. The craters foim 
vast hollows on the sides of these peaks. Tbe idoud- 
tsin itself consists for tbe most part of sand and slags ; 
tbe lava being confined to the lower regions, ukI rent- 
ing an immensely rugged and vitrified wall around iu 
base. Tlie most dreadful volcanic eruption knows b 
Iceland was Irom Skaptar Yokul, an ice mouniiin. 
near the sources of several rivers, and composed of about 20 red, conical bills. It took pliu 
in 1763, and caused great devastations. Orafa Yokvl, ibe highest mountain in Iceland, a 
supposed to be an elevation of 6.240 feet. The Suipknr Momttain has been described as â–  
" natural cauldron of black, boiling mud ;" the sulphur exhales from it in great profusion. 

3. Ctimate. The cold is not more intense in Iceland than in the most favored parts of Deo- 
mark, and the thermometer seldom or never sinks to zero. What aSects tbe temperature awsi 
is tbe arrival of floating ice from Greenland. This comes in immense masses, often so Urp 
as to run aground in 80 faiboms. When it remains for a long time on the coast, the winlei 
mows are longer in melting, the frost remains in tbe ^ound, vegetation is checked, eod !bÂ« 
summer is very short. 

4. Otology^ &c. Iceland is a ch^n of immense rocks, in the structure of which trap aixt 
bnKall predominate. Their summits are crowned with snow, though everlasting fires bum in 
tbeir subterranean caverns. Tracts of lava traverse the island in every direction. Tiie gerÂ» 
rtl appeara nee of tbe country is the most fugged and dreary imaginable. On ever}' side are iIm 

Swning craters of active or extinguished volcanoes, the sources of the surrounding desolaiiuiL 
many places the basalt takes the form of immense masses of pillars, like the well-ktwwD 
Giant's Causeway in Ireland. 

The hot springs of this island are very remarkable, and are quite numerous. Tbe most 

celebrated is the Gnat Gtystr, in 
the nelgliborbood of Mount Hecla. 
The water boils with a loud, rumbling 
noise, in a well of an irregular forni, 
about 10 feet in diameter, widening 
near the top, and opening into a basiD 
56 feet by 46. Its explosions are 
announced by sounds resemblmg tbe 
low report of artillery. The first 
jets which are thrown up, seldom ei- 
teed 15 or 20 feet, but the bigbesi 
often exceed SO. On the propulsioo 
of the jet, tbe great body of the co- 
I lumn rises perpendicularly, and then 
divides into beautiful curvated ramifi- 
cations, which are projected in every 
GreajQeynr. direction. The esiplosjons of the 

Great Geyser lake place at intervals 
of about 6 hours. There are many other inferior springs of boiling water, and several of boil- 
ing mud. 

At Sortahellir is a long cavern, 40 feet high, 50 broad, and 5,034 in length. The entrsDce iÂ»

Ictlmiders, 



poMd bj the natives to hare been fonnerly the residence of the king of the regions of fire. 
One of the minor caves is beautifuUj coated with pure ice in every form of crystalization. 

6, M^ural ProdncHons.^ Among the vegetables is a species of wild wheat, vvhich may be 
made into good flour. Besides the lichens, there are many anti-scorbuiic roots, and several 
marme fJlants, which are used as food. Wild berries of an excellent flavor are found in abunÂ« 
dance. Of late years, gardening has been practised throughout the country, but with little 
success. There are no belter trees than birch and brushwood. Immense quantities of pine, 
firs, and other trees, however, are thrown upon the northern coasts. 

6. Minerals. A very singular mineral production of this island is a kind of fossil wood, 
black, heavy, and slightly carbonized, burning with flame. There is another kind of mineral 
wood, heavier than coal, which burns without flame, and contains chalcedony in its transverse 
fissures. Of the ordinary lava, there are several different formations. The central mountains 

contain copper and iron ; which are not wrought for want of 
fuel ; also marble, lime, plaster, porcelain clay, several kinds 
of bole, onyx, agate, jasper, and an abundance of sulphur. 

7. TownSj Population^ &c. The capital is Reykiavik ; it 
is a seaport with some trade. The other considerable towns 
are Holm and Husarik. The chief agricultural product is hay. 
Most of the inhabitants are employed in fishing. The trade 
consists in the exportation of fish, oil, skins, feathers, and sulÂ» 
phur. The population is about 70,000. 

8. Inhabitants. The Icelanders are rather tall, of a frank, 
open countenance, florid complexion, and yellow, flaxen hair. 
1 he women are short in proportion to the men^ and inclined 
to corpulency. 

9. Dress. The common dress of the men is a linen shirt, a 
short jacket, and wide breeches reaching above the jacket. 
The men wear three-cornered hats. The most curious part of 
the female dress is the turban, of white hnen, stiffened with Â» 

great many pins, and about 20 inches in height. It is fastened to the head by a dark-sitk 
handkerchief, that is tied several times around it, and completely hides the hair. Thb haa 
for ages been the national dress. 

10. Language. This is the Icelandic, an original language, or the Scandinavian, the. stock 
of several languages in the north of Europe. 

11. Manner y Building. The houses in Iceland are all constructed in the ^me man- 
ner. The walls are thick, and composed of alternate layers of earth and of stone. The 
rafters are a few beams of drift-wood, or of whalebones interlaced with twigs, and covered 
with turf. This kind of roof always bears good grass, which is cut witli the scythe. There 
is generally a dark alley running through the middle of the house, and on either side of this are 
the entrances to the various apartments, as the kitchen, the stranger's room, the sleeping room, 
&c. The stranger^s room is always the best in the house. The light is admitted from 
the roof through windows of glass, or of the membranes of sheep. There is no chim- 
ney in the kitchen, and the smoke escapes through a hole in the roof. The Icelanders never 
have fire even in winter, but for cooking. The beds are arranged on each side the sleeping 
room. They are very narrow, yet the people sleep by couples, lying head to foot. The noor 
is commonly the damp earth? This manner of life causes pulmonary diseases, mhich carry 
off many people, and few attain to old age. 

12. Food. The ordinary diet is of the simplest kind. The breakfast is of sour curds, 
mixed sometimes with sweet milk and flavored with berries. The dinner is of dried fish and 
butter. The latter, when rancid, is most esteemed, and bears double the price of fresh and 
new. The supper is like the breakfast, or it is sometimes a kind of porridge ; and this is to a 
foreigner the most palatable of all the Icelandic diet. On great occasions, the people have 
boDed mutton and rye porridge. Beef is seldom eaten, and there is no bread except a little of 
the sour, Danish biscuit. The usual beverage is whey mixed with water. 

13. Diseases. The most common maladies are obstinate coughs, or consumptions ; and the 
want of personal neatness engenders cutaneous diseases. Many children die before the 10th 
jeaii, ana about a twenty-fifth of the deaths are from accidents, generally drowning. 

14. Mode of Traveling. No other civilized country offers so many obstacles to the trtv* 



819 icm^Am. 

eler ns Iceland. There $re no coi^tmg vessels to take bim from one plaoe to aoothep alosg dtt 
shore, and there are do vehicle?, and scarcely any roads in the interior. The only wajr of 
tittTeling is on horseback, and in general the horse is purchased, not hired. There is, howem, 
a truly hospitable custom and feeling, that leads the inhabitant^ to exchange with the traveki, 
without a shilling for boot, a good and fresh horse, for one lean and jaded with a long joune]t. 
The horses are seldom housed or fed, even in winter, but subsist chiefly on the sea-weeot 
thrown up by the tide They are of a stout race, and are broken to an amble, an easy gait ibr 
an eauestrian. As there are no inns, and little desirable shelter in the small and crowded 
dwellings, the traveler usuallv carries a tent, and the nature of the road imposes an equal iiecei- 
sity for a guide ; while the logs or storms of snow, make it necessary, that he should also bt 
provided with a compass. He must ford rivers if the ice be too weak to bear him, and if not 
provided with shelter, he must sometimes seek it in caverns, or build a house of snow. In 
winter it is impossible to travel at all, and even in summer, when there is no obstruction from 
iee and snow, there is enough of difficulty and danger, in crossing rivers, olimbing qkhubMubs, 
passmg morasses, and picking a way over the burning and smoking ground, rent by eartbquakei 
into chasms. 

Towards the end of June, the Icelanders make a journey to the coast, to sell their prodoc- 
tions to the factories, and bring back other commodities in exchange, for the traffic is earned 
OQ rather by exchange, than money, â€” * though the absence of money has produced a sort of 
substitute in fish and wadmal (a coarse cloth). Of fiaih, there were in the time of Von Troll, 
48 to the rix dollar. This transportation of goods to the coast and back, leads the people, for 
mutual assistance, to travel in caravans, and sometimes 70 horses are seen together, going down 
tp the coast, and often at the factories there are 300 horses and half as many t^its. 

15. Manners and Custonn, It is only on the confines of the polar circle, that we must look 
for society in a state of primitive simplicity, and with a difi^usion of a great degree of knowl- 
Bflge, though without the answering grade of refinement. The remote insular situation of Ice- 
land, and its poverty, which one of its pastors called the ^^ bulwark of its happiness," is a foh 
tunate barrier to the visits of foreigners, who might, indeed, introduce to those secluded re- 
^ons more knowledge of the world, coupled with a greater familiarity with its vices. The 
oarly settlers of Iceland, like thofe of New England, were a race well fitted to leave a high 
state ot moral feeling and intelligence to their descendants. Many of them were distinguished 
men of Norway, who preferred exile to oppression at home, and who carried to their adopted 
country the germ of republican institutions, and of the knowledge that can the best upaeU 
them. 

The most prominent traits in the Icelanders are a love of their country, hospitality, in^ 

5 nee, simplicity, and piety. Though social, they are rather disposed to be serious. Thej 
ve little conception of humor, and are seldom known to laugh. Yet they may be called so 
eminently happy people, and seldom leave their own country \ the few who go io Copeoba|M 
are never satisfied till they return to Iceland. It would almost seem that happiness, and sim- 
plicity of character, had deserted the sunny skies and fertile fields of southern Europe, te 
oestle among the icy crags and volcanic ruins of the frozen zone. In Iceland a stranger is at 
once struck with the oriental manner of salutation, borrowed probably from the Scriptures, with 
which all are familiar, though until lately but few copies were possessed. The common salu- 
tation on meeting is that of the East, ^' Peace be with you,'' to which the reply is, ^' The 
Lord bless you." On knocking at a door to gain admittance it is conunon to say, ^^ The Lord 
be m this place," to which the reply is similar to the last. # 

It is the universal custom to give thanks with clasped hands before and after a meal ; when 
the meal is over, the guests kiss both the master and the mistress, thanking them for their kifid- 
ness. At meeting and parting, the kiss is the universal salutation ; on entering a faniilj tke 
visiter must thus salute them all, according to seniority or station, beginning with the highest; 
At his departure he reverses this, and the lowest is taken leave ol first. Before and after 
crossing a river the Icelander raises his hat and makes a mental prayer, and also when be goes 
ia a botk from the shore. This religious sentiment is the leading trait in the Icelandic cbaiac- 
ter. Of their characteristic faith. Doctor Henderson gives this example. *^ I could not bA 
notice," said he, ^^ the manner in which my hostess spoke of her children : on my inquiring 
bow many she had, her reply was, I have 4 ; 3 of them are here with us, and the other 2 are 
with God. It is the best with those tluit are with him, and my chief concern about those .tbst 
ramtin is, that they maty reach heaven in safety."

1^. Jfniuiemairf. The amusiements of the Iceldnderd are of & gitiv6 ehatsctet, Ibuoded 
less oo lenty than the intelligence that is so much difiused a^ong diem, and though they have 
chete, and cards, they generally prefer to pass their evenings in recounting some^egend of their 
luic^tors, or reading by turns the history of their own country, or some other useful book. As 
books are scarce m Iceland, copies are multiplied m tnaliuscript, and tnany of them are so well 
^e6uted as to be beautiful specimens of the art. 

17t Education, There is no other country in which so gteat a^ amoutit of knowledge is 
imirersally diffused as in Iceland ; and yet there b on the island but 1 school, and that is de- 
signed chiefly for such as are to fill ofRces in church and state. The education is strictly do- 
mestic, and no one acquures any that he doed not get at home. The extent to which it is ciur- 
ried is scarcely credible. It is not uncommon to hear a youth quote a Greek or Latin author, 
sad in almost every hut there is some person capable of conversing well upon subjects, far 
alK>ve the understanding of tliose of the same grade in other countries. The Icelanders are 
not only familiar with their own history and literature, but they ere in a great degree conversatit 
with those of other nations. It is surprising to hear Aese self-taueht people conversing on 
subjects that belong to a professor's chair. Among other instances of this wonderful difTusion 
of education, Doctor Henderson relates, that he was readibg to a common person a letter ad- 
dressed by the King of Persia to the English Envoy, concerning a version of the New Testa- 
ment. The date was 1229, and a liiile boy remarked, that it must be a very old letter. *' No," 
said the peasant, ^^it was not written according to our computation, but it was dated from the 
JSfarira." 

18. Â«dr(9. Sciences J &c. Till the year 1264, from the introduction of Christianity into 
Iceland, it was the only place in the North where literature was cultivated. The Scandinavian 
l^^ods were wild and warlike. The Scalds were the poets and historiatis, and the Sagas re- 
caDed the memory of the past in stories. These traditional histories and poems were collect- 
ed by Saemund Sigfussen, who was bom A. I). 1056. This collection is called the Edda. 
Tke mythology of the Scandinavians was copious. Divine honors were paid to Odin, who 
was supposed to be a sanguinary deity, receiving into his paradise ValhaDa, only the brave and 
warlike. Friga, his wife, was the second deity, and Thor the third. There were many others 
inferior. 

19. Religi<m. The religion is strictly Lutheran, and the parishes are m number 184. The 
dergr, who are all natives c^ the island, are but partly maintained by tithes ; they cultivate the 
glebe attached to the churches, and many of them are obliged to follow the occupation of fish- 
ermen. The richest living m the island does not produce 200 rix dollars, and there are parish- 
es in which the stipend is as low as 5. But the clergy are faithful if not for hire. Every one 
keeps what is called a ^^ register of souls," or a statement of the conduct, abilities, and pro- 
ficiency of each individual in the parish. The family books are also entered in this register, 
which is given to the Dean at his annual visitation. Every clergyman is bound to visit every 
fiimily in his parish at least twice a year, when he catechizes every inmate, old and young. 

20. Government and Laws, Iceland is a colony of Denmark ; the Governor is appoiued 
fay the King, and holds his office 5 years. The laws are of the mild character that befits a 
country where crimes are almost unknown. Fines, imprisonment, and whipping are the only 
penalties inflicted in Iceland. Crimbals that are capitally convicted are sent to Copenhagen 
to be beheaded, as, for many years, no person has been found on the island tO' execute the sea* 
teoce of the law. 

21. History. Iceland was settled by the Norwegians in the 9th century, and for many years 
eeoBtitoted an independent republic. In 1264, it came under the dominion of the King of 
Norway, and was subsequently transferred with that country to the crown of Denmark, und<ef 
which it reBoains at present. 

CHAPTER LI. NORWAY. 

1. Boundaries and Â£irten/. Norway is bounded north l^ the Nortlierti Ocean, cast by 
IhreJeii , south by the Bcagerae, west and northwest by tlie 'Uennan Ocean. It extends from 



NOBWAT. 

' 66^ to 7P 1 r N. ladtode, and from 5^ to 30^ Â£. longitude. It n a mutow strip of timiiq, 
for the most part not exceeding 60 miles in length, and contains 130,000 square miles. 

2. Mount<iin8. The Norwegian Mountains form a grand chain, extending northeast Â«i 
southwest nearly 1 ,200 miles. The northern part of this chain forms the boundary betwca 
Norway and Sweden ; in the south, it bears the name of the Sevebergety and DovrtfitU^wt 
further north, the name of the Kioelen mountains; The highest point of the cbaio, istkl 
8cag8tlo8t%ndy in the DovreBeld range, which is 8,400 feet above the sea. There are glicieii 
in these mountains, presentingbeautiful and fantastic masses of ice, which are ascribed bjAi 
simple northern tribes, to the powers of magic. It b the peculiar character of the NonreÂ» 
gian mountains, that they combine the grandeur of Alpine scenery, with the luxuriant softnei 
of the vales of Italy. 

3. Rivers, Numerous streams descend from the mountains, but none are navigable, and dom 
are considerable for length except the Glommen which rises in Lake Oesting, and flows soodh 
erly into the sea at Frederickstadt. Cataracts and shoals obstruct its course in every pan, iDii 
the only use to which it is applied, is that of floating down timber from the mountains. 

4. Lakes. The lakes are numerous, and many are of considerable size. The Mmt% a 
60 miles in length, and 18 wide. The Rundsion is 50 miles long, and 2 in width. Tbe Lsh 
ofFmmund is 35 miles long, and 8 wide. In many of the lakes are floating islands, or mr- 
dynesy composed of pieces of turf, or sea-grass; torn from the shores by the water, and matted 
together by the force of the currents. 

5. Islands. The Lqffoden Islands lie on the northwestern coast, and form a crescent rooal 
a bay called the West Fiord. The largest is Hindooen. They consist of high mountalos, 
covered with perpetual snow. Nearly all the remainder of the coast b strewed with souD 
rocky islands, called, in the language of the country, holms. 

6. Bays. The branches of the sea, which indent the whole coast of Norway, are almost 
innumerable ; but they aflTord scarcely one good harbor. Among the Lofibden islands b tbe 
whirlpool of Maelstrom^ which in rough weather is very dangerous to ships.* 

7. Capes. The two most remarkable capes lie at the two extremities of the country. Jforii 
Cape^ at the northern extremity, is formed by several islands lying close to the shore ; they 
consist of high craggy rocks, and exhibit the most dreary and desolate appearance. The 
southern extremity of Norway is called the JVaze, and forms the northern point of the entrimce 
to a strait called the Sleeve, which communicates with the Baltic. 

8. Climate and Soil. Norway extends within the Arctic circle, and its northern part is cl- 
osed to all the rigors of a polar winter ; here the sun continues above tlie horizon in summer, 
or two months and a half, and in winter remains below for an equal space. There is bardlj 

such a thing in Norway, as spring or autumn, the summer's heat so suddenly succeeds tbe cold 
of winter. In the southern parts are some tracts of considerable fertility, yet the soil of No^ 
way, generally, is stony and barren ; and in many parts it may be said there is none at aO. 

9. Geology and Minerals. These wild regions consist almost wholly of the primary strati- 
fied rocks ; gneiss is the most frequent and abundant ; the mica-slates, clay-slates, and boro- 
blende rocks being subordinate to it. Veins of granite, sienite, and porphyry occur, and diert 
are beds of transition limestone, and old red sandstone. Norway possesses quarries of granite, 



I 



* An Americiiii captain given the following description 
of thin celebrated *plienoinenon. ** I had occasion, some 
years since, to navi^te a ship from the North Cape to Dron- 
tlieim, nearly all the way between the islands or rocks, and 
the main. On inquiring of my Norwegian pilot abnut the 
practicability oT running near the whirlpool, he told me, 
that with a good breexe it could be approached near 
enough for examination, without danger, and I at once 
determined to satisfy myself. We began to near it about 
10, A. M., in thk month of September, with a fine leading 
wind, northwest. Two good seamen were placed at the 
helm, the mate on the quarter-deck, all hands at their sta- 
tion for working ship, and the pilot standing on the bow- 
sprit betw(*en the night-heads. I went on the main- 
topsail yard with a good glass. I had been seated but a 
few moments, when my ship entered the duh of the 
whirlpool. The velocity of the water altered her course 
8 points U/Wards the centre, although she was going 3 
knots through the water. This alarmed me extremely for 
t rooment I thought destractum was ineTitable. Bbe, 



however, answered to her helm sweetly, and we nni)Â»Â»f 
the edffe, the waters foaming round us in eve^tii*** 
while sne was dancing gayly over them. The seiMSliwii 
I experienced are difficult to describe. Imagine toj^' 
â– elves an immense circle running round, of a diam^^o^ 
one mile and a half, the velocity increasing as it tpffVX' 
i mated towards the centre, and gradually cbangiog its 
dark-blue color to white, â€” foaming, tumbling, rofhinf )â€¢ 
its vortex, very much concave, as much so as the wtHrio 
a tunnel, when half run out; the noisÂ«, too, bis8iog,ntr' 
ing, dashing, all pressing on the mind ot once, pre^nt^i 
the most awful, grand, and solemn sight, I ever '^P^* 
enced. We were near it about 18 minutes, and in ap^ 
of it 2 hours. It- is evidenUy a subterranean P^xp- 
From its magnitude. I should not doubt that in*t*^ta^ 
â€¢truction would be the fate of a dosen of onrlargeitiBip")

that several vessels bsve been tucked down, tai â– â–  
whales havft also been destroyed."

, md' elate, and tfaess amides are exported. The sflrer lUines afKoBO- 
bcT^ formerly afforded rich returns, but have ceased to be productive. There are valuaUe 
copper mines near Rsraas and Droniheim ; the principal iron mines are those^f Arenda' and 
Kr^eroc in soulbem Norway, but there are numerous others ; the annual produce of the roo- 
miiies of Norway is 150,000 Ions. There are also some mines of gold, lead, cobalt, plumba- 
go, aad alum. ' 

10. VegaabU Prodvcliom. Immense forests of pine, 6r, birch, ash, &.c., cover the 
mountains, and furnish the only important natural productions of the vegetable kingdom. 

11. Animalt. Norway has the same animals with Sweden ; but the glutton and the lem- 
â– aing or Nortvay mouse, are in some degree peculiar to this country. 

12. Fact of Ike Cofmlry. A great part of this territory is occupied by mountains, inters 
â– persed with romantic glens and fertile valleys, Especially in the southern parts. It is intersect- 
ed by many streams full of cataracts, and lakes and ponds bordered with trees of variegated 
foliage, and forests of tall and stately pines and firs. There adnrd the most striking scenery, 
but the multitude of naked rocks and barren mountains, give the landscape rather the appearance 
of grandeur than of beauty. Marshes and fens occupy large districts, and nowhere m Europe 
â– re found such a number of precipices, cataracts, and glaciers as here. 

13. TounT. ChrUtiania, the capital, stands in a fertile valley on (he shore of a bay. It 
M built with regular streets, which are kept very clean ; there are many beautiful villas in the 
neighborhood, and the country around it has several productive copper mines. The town 
bas a niilitaiy hospital, a university, four churches, two theatres, and enjoys a considerable 

trade in the exportation of deals, tar, and the pro- 
duct of the mines. Population, 37,500. Bergen 
Stands upon a small bay skirted by mountains. It 
is built mostly of wood, and has a theatre, and two 
printing offices. The commerce and fisheries of 
ihe place are pretty active. The most noted build- 
ings are the castle and cathedral. Population, 
20,800. 

Dronlkeim, or Tronyem, is one of the most 
flourishing towns in the kingdom. It stands on an 
arm of the sea, at the point of union of four great 
valleys. The streets are wide and regular, and the 
houses are mostly of wood. It exports iron, tim- 
IfatchiuKof Bergta. ^^^' ^"*' ^^^' " '^ *''Â® ""esidence of a bishop, and 

has a magnificent cathedral in which the ancient 
kings of Norway were crowned. Population, 14,000. Kongsberg is a considerable mining 
town, with a mint. Population, HjOOO, S(a- 
vanger and Drammen are seaports with some 
trade. Ckristiansand, on the Seagerac, ii 
chiefly important for its excellent port, into 
i which ships often put for repairs and shelter 

The little town of Ilammerfeit, on the island 
I of Hvuloe, near the North Cape, is remarka- 

' hie for being the most northerly town in Eu- 

rope, in latitude 70Â° 36'. It is the capital of 
the province of Flnraark, yet contains but 77 
inhabitants. Waarkuvs, in 70Â° 22', Is the most 
northerly fortress in the world. 

H. .Agriculture. The soil of Norway is 
often so shallow as not to admit of being plough- 
ed, yet vegetation is amazingly quick ; corn is 
Hammtrftat. sown and reaped within C or 7 weeks ; and is 

raised under the 70th parallel of latitude ; both 
the soil and climate, however, are unfavorable to agriculture, and no part of the country yielda 
MifficieDt grain for the inhabitants. 

15. Commerct. The exports of wood, fish, iron, copper, ^ass, alum, marble, kelp, dyeing

^Oiut of the northern fisheries. The herring Gsbery is not so producdve as formerly. 

17. Divisions, Population, &c. Norway is divided into 17 bailiwics, but on mapiiiii 
â€¢Ttea merely represented as consisting of 6 great divisiooB. Finmark, which is incltritd Id 
Lapland, ^ordl and, Aggerhuns, Cbristiansand, Bergen, and Drontbeini. The populatioti ii 
1,300,000. The revenue is l,5pO,000 dollars. The miliiaiy fwce is about 13,000 men. 

18. Inhabitants, Manners, &c. The inhabitants of Norway are haidy and robust, and (be 

women, like those of Swedm, are many of them beautiful. Tki 
dress is plain, Std generally of a stone color, with white metil 
buttons and red buttonholes. Furs are mucb worn in wioitr. 
The language which is spoken in Norway, is the Danish. Tbc 
usual food of the peasants is milk, cheese, and fish. Flesbind 
oat-bread, made hard, as in Sweden, are more rare. iDlian 
of scarcity the bark of fir trees is mixed with the oat-med. A 
common soup is made of oat-meal or barley-meal, seasoned 
with a pickled herring or sailed mackerel. The Norwegians, Skt 
ihe Swedes, are much addicted to the use of spirits, iboi^ 
without suffering the injurious efiÂ«cts produced by imenipenDU 
in warmer climates. The use of tobacco is general. The peo- 
ple are far more sprightly than the Danes, and it would no! bt 
easy to fitid a nation more cheerful than the Norwegians. Tbej 
â– y â–  are brave, energetic, and patriotic. The peasants are franltsiio 

hospitable, and have great independence. Their mode of lalu- 
â€¢alion, even to superiors, is by shakiDg hands, and this is the way also in which they retun 
thanks for a favor. 

The Norwegians have some of the amusements common in Sweden, and they delight also in 
recounting tales of their ancestors, which, in their social meetings, they often do by tuns- 
Skating upon the snow is a practice very common in this country. The skates are made of 
wood, and are very large. The snow is frozen so hard, that the skaters pass over it asswilv

ly as upon ice. At Drontheim is a regiment of soldiers called skate-runners. They cinj â€¢ 
tt&6, flword, and a long, climbing staff, shod with iron. They go 200 or 300 paces apart, wi) 
move so swiftly, that no cavalry can approach them. 

Without a great many establishments for educaiion, the people, nevertheless, are rot illite- 
rate, and there are few peasants who cannot read and write. There are two seminaries for the 
instruction of teachers. There are many itinerant schoolmasters, who stay in a hamlet itwut 
two wedcs at a lime. There is not much national literature ; and mathematics is the favoriie 
â€¢ludy. The religion is Protestant, and there are some vestiges of paganism. At funerals â–  
rtoliu is played at the head of the cofiin, and questions, as in various countries, are addresK<l

19. ChvemmÂ§ni. Norway is united to the Swedish crown, and governed by a viceroy. It 
ia, however, so far independent, that the finances, legislation, and administration, are distinct. 
The Storthing is the representative assembly, and has much higher powers and privileges thai 
ibe Swedish diet. It assembles frequently, and without awaiting the royal summons, and the 
ki^ has only a qualified veto on its proceedings. A highly republican spirit prevails in Nor- 
way, and the influence of the nobles is almost annihilated. The press is entirely free. 

20. History, The early inhabitants of Norway were probably a tribe of the Finns, th^ an- 
oeiitors of the modem Laplanders, who were conquered and driven out by the Goths. In the 
9tb century the country was divided into 10 or 12 small States, which were formed intooae 
MUioQ by Harold Hafager. It was repeatedly conquered by the Swedes and Danes, in the 
lOth, 11th, and 13th centuries. In 1380 it became, by marriage of the king, an appendage to 
the crown of Denmark, in which state it reinained up to the present century. It was arbitrarily 
wrested from Denmark by the allied powers and transferred to Sweden, in 1814, much against 
the will of the Norwegians, as a reward to that power for joining the confederacy against France. 

CHAPTER Lll. SWEDEN. 

1 . Boundaries and Extent. Sweden is bounded northwest by Norway, east by Russia, ^e 
Gulf of Bothnia, and the Baltic, south by the Baltic, and west by Norway and the Cattegat. It 
lies between 55^ 20' and 69^ N. latitude, and 1 1^ and 24^ E. longitude. Its greatest length b 
1^200 miles ; and its greatest breadth 350. It contains 170,000 square miles. 

2. Mountains. The principal mountains are found in the chain which separates Sweden 
firom Norway. Mount Swucku is the highest of this chain. Kinekulhy on the banks of lake 
Wener, consists of a number of terraces, rising one above another. RaetrUc^ another moun- 
tain, is estimated to be 6,000 feet above the level of the sea. One of the highest glaciers in 
Sweden occurs in the southern part of Lulea Lapmark, and has been long regarded by the 
superstitious natives with awe, being denominated, in the Lapponean language, SuKtelmaj or 
the Hill of God. It forms three peaks, of the respective altitudes of 5,760, 5,870, and 
6,178 feet. 

3. Rivers. The principal river is the Dahly which rises in the mountains between Sweden 
and Norway, and, after a course of 260 miles, falls into the Gulf of Bothnia. The rivers Cro- 
Aa and Motala are the outlets of the lakes Wener and Wetter. The other rivers are the 
Vamea^ the Kalix^ the Lula^ Pt/ea, Umeay and Angermanna. 

4Â« Lakes. The largest lake is the Wener ^ which is 100 miles long, and 60 broad. It con- 
severar islands, and receives 24 rivers. The Wetter is about the same length, but nowhere 
icis 25 miles in breadth. It receives about 40 small streams. By the Gotha canal, be- 
the Wetter and Wener, the German Ocean and the Baltic are united, and the dangerous 
^ ition through the Sound is avoided. The Malar is 60 miles in length, by 18 in breadth, 
contains a great number of small islands. The Hielmar is about 40 miles in length, and 
30 Si breadth. 

Islands and Seas. Gothland^ on the southeast coast of Sweden, forms, with some small 
surrounding it, a province containing 766 square miles. The island of Â«dland, in the 
is 70 miles in length, and 6 in breadth. It is almost barren, but has some large forests, 
abound in deer, bares, and wild boars. Sweden b washed by two seas, the Cattegat 
an^ ^Ae Baltic. The Baltic forms, in the northwest, the Gulf of Botnnia. 

6. Climate. The cold of the winter in Sweden is intense ; the spring is a rapid and con- 
atapt alternation of rain, snow, and frost ; the summer is short, but dry and pleasant, thou^ from 
the great length of the days, and the reflection of the sunbeams from the rocks and mountains, 
the beat is sometimes excessive. Autumn is the finest season. 

7. Soil* The soil is in general very poor, though there are some fertile spots ; the greater 
part of Swedish Lapland is sterile, and covered with rocks, peats, or moss, and gravelly plains ; 
there are a few tracts of soil tolerably good in the southern parts. 

â€¢ 8. Oeology. Most of the mountains are composed of granite, calcareous stone, and slate ; 
the basis of the majority is granite, which is frequently found in bu^ separate masses, rising ta 
a considerable height.

9. Vegetabh Prodtictioiu. The spruce and Seotcb firs are 6ie mo** eoimnon ow. Tu 
forests of birch, poplar, and mountain asb overspread many parts. TLa oak, beech, md tin 
Sourish in the sooth. Fniit trees are not indigenous ; but a vanetj' of berries are produced, 
the most delicious of which is the Arctic raspberry {Rabat wcttciu), vbicb, wbm npe, it n- 
perior in fragrance and flavor to the finest strawberries. 

10. Mineral Springs. There are about 360 mineral springs in Sweden, among which Ae 
baths of Medevi, and the wells of Loka Later, Rambosa, and Rottenby, are the most cel^ 
brated. 

11. MineraU. The mines of silver, copper, lead, and especially iron, constitute tbe (^eT 

wealth of this country. In 1T3B, â–  

Sid mine was discovered nesr Aii^ 
â– s, which formerly yielded 40 mnb 
' annually, but it is now nearly exbsost- 

ed. The principal co|Â»)erminesarei!i 
Dalecarlia ; that of t ahlun has been 
worked upwards of 1 ,000 years, tnd 
produces 2,000,000 lbs. of co]^ 
annually. The iron mines at Dsiik- 
mora, in Upsala, produce (be best 
iron in the world ; ibey were disw- 
ered in 1488, and have no subieni- 
nean galleries, but are worked in the 
open air, like gravel-pits ; they cod- 
sist of 13 excavations, the whole ei- 
tent of which collectively is 760 fed 
jHiiu in stDotm. in length, by 500 feet in Hepili ', ibe 

mines belong to 13 proprietors, nbo 
maintain 1,579 workmen. The noted mountain of Taberg, in Smaaland, is one entire mass 
of rich iron-ore, 400 feet high, and 3 miles in circumference, and has been worked 200 year?. 
The mines of Carlstadt are also numerous and productive ; the most remarkable are those of 
Petflberg ; these are 13 in number, dug into a mountain wholly composed of veins and beds of 
iron-ore. In the wide abyss, suddenly appears a vast prospect of yawning caverns and prodi- 
gious machinery. Immense buckets, suspended by rattling chains, pass up and down ; lad- 
ders scale the inward precipices, upon which the workmen look like pigmies ; the clanking of 
chains, the groaning of pumps, the hallooing of the miners, the creaking of the blocks mi 
wtieeis, the trampling of horses, the heating of hammers, and tbe loud subterraneous thiiudet 
from ilie blasting of rocks, produce an eSecl that no one can witness unmoved. There are 
rich mmes of'iron in other parts, which, owing to the difficulties of transportation, are noc 
worked. Tbe whole annual produce of Sweden, is nearly 2,000,000 tons, Sweden likewise 
produces porphyry, rock-crj'Rtal, coal, cobalt, alum, sulphur, vitriol, and antimony. Nearly 
all the fine modern works in porphyry, are of the porpbyiy of Elfdal. 

la. Animals- The wild animals of Sweden are wolves, bears, beavers, elks, reindeers, 
ioxte, hares, and squirrels. Tbe Swedish wolves are not so fierce as those which infest tbe 
southern parts of Europe. In winter, the foxes and squirrels become gray, and tbe bares t> 
white as snow. About 300 species of birds are found in the country. The rivers and lato 
abound in fish. 

13. Face of the Country. Sweden is intersected by numerous marshes, hills, and lakes, 
and, beyond the 60th degree, appear vast tracts of wild and uninhabited land, approximating, k 
we proceed northwards, to the sterility and bleak aspect of the polar districts. Nature in vari- 
ous places presents the wildest and most sublime features ; but in general tbe scenery is <>â– "' 
form. The coasts surrounding the Bolhnian Gulf and the Baltic are bold and rugged, inrfeniHl 
with mtmerous bays, and stretching out into imposing promontories. â€¢ 

14. Divisions. Sweden may be divided into 3 parts, viz. northern, southern, and middle 
Bweden ; which are subdivided inia 24 Ixns or provinces. Tbe ancient divisions were Goth 
Jand, Lapland, Noriand, and Sweden Proper. 

15. Canals. The Canal of Trollhatta opens a communication between tbe North ^> 
and Lake Wener, by farming a new channel where the Gotha is rendered unnavigahle by can- 
nets. Lake Malar is united with the Hiehnar by the Canal of Srboga ; vrithLake &:teii, 



by tbe Canal qJ Str^mAolm ; and with the Baltic, by the Caml of Sodertelge. The Cti^dl 
â‚¬f Gotha extends from Soderkoping, on tbe Baltic, across tbe peninsula, by the lakes Weoer 
and Wetter, to Gottenburg, on me Cattegat, 150 miles ; this canal is 24 feet deep, and 34 
feet wide. 

1 6. Town9. Stockholmj the capital, is situated at the Junction of the lake Malar with an fadet 
of tlie Baltic. It stands upon seven small, rocky islands, beside two peninsulas, and is built 
upon piles. A variety of picturesque views are formed by numberless rocks of granite rising 
boldly from the surface oi the water, partly bare and craggy, partly dotted with houses, or 
adorned with gardens and trees. The central island is bordered by a stately row of buildings, 
the residences of the principal merchants. It contains the palace and other public buildings ; 
but the houses being high, and the streets narrow, its appearance is somewhat gloomy ; the 
number of bridges, great and small, in this capital, is 13. At a short distance from the royal 
palace stands a fine statue of Gustavus the Third, in bronze, on a pedestal of polished porphyry- 
Constantinople is perhaps the only city in Europe that surpasses it in beauty of situation ; me 
royal palace is hardly exceeded in splendor by any on the continent. The city has likewise an 
arsenaJ, a mint, an exchange, two theatres, the palace of the diet, numerous learned institutions, 
&c. The hangar^ or great iron warehouse, is remarkable for the immense quantity of tfairt article 
deposited in it. The commerce and manufactures are extensive ; the harbor is deep and capa- 
cious, though difficult of access ; a thousand sail of shipping may lie here in safety, and die 
largest vessels can approach close to the quay. Population, 88,000. 

Upsala^ formerly the metropolis of Sweden, is situated on an extensive plain, upon the small 
stream Fyrisa. In the centre is a square^ from which the streets extend in straight lines. This 
town is famous for its beautiful cathedral and for its university, which has a library of 60,000 
volumes. Population, 5,000. 

Crothenburg or Gottenburgy near the mouth of the river Gotha, has a circumference of tiiree 
miles. It is regularly fortified, and, in the upper part of the town, the streets rise above each 
other like an amphitheatre. Some of the modem buildings are of brick, but the greater number 
are of wood, and painted red. The harbor is spacious, and the commerce considerable. 
Population, 30,000. Carheronay on a bay of the Baltic, is the station of the Swedish navy, 
and has a harbor which is defended at its entrance by two strong forts. It is celebrated for its 
docks, which are separated from the town by a high wall, and one of which is cut out of the 
solid rock. Population, 13,800. 

OerebrOy at the western extremity of Lake Hielmar, carries on an extensive iron trade. 
Population, 3,400. Malmoty exactly opposite Copenhagen, contains about 5,000 inhabitants^ 
and possesses some commerce, though the harbor is bad. Fahlutiy 160 miles north of Stock- 
holm, is remarkable for its extensive copper mines. The number of forges here give the town 
a very sombre appearance. Population, 4,700. Gefity on the Gulf of Bothnia, is a well-built 
town, with some foreign commerce. Population, 10,000. J^orrkopingy 10,000 inhabitants, 
with extensive woolen manufactures ; Lundy 3,500, containing a university, observatory, and 
other learned establishments ; fVisbyy on the island of Gothland, formerly one of the principal 
cities of the north of Europe, and still, though much declined, carrying on a brisk trade, 4,000 
mbabitants ; and Calmavy noted in Swedish history, are the other principal Swedish towns. 

17. Agriculture. Much attention has been paid to agriculture, and the peasants are very 
industrious ; but owing to the deficiency of the soil, they are hardly able to raise enough of grain 
for home consumption. Corn, rye, oats, potatoes, flax, hemp, hops, and tobacco are very 
generally cultivated ; and several kinds of fruit are raised with success. 

18. Commerce and Manufactures. Sweden has few manufactures, and Norway even less ; and 
the products of their manufacturing industry cannot sustain a competition with those of other 
countries. The working of the mmes, the manufacture of glass and hardware, ship-building, 
and the felling and preparation of timber, employ many laborers. The peasants in general make 
their own rude implements and materials of dress. The fisheries form an important branch of 
industry, particularly in Norway. The maritime commerce of this country is active and exten- 
sive ; and i^ brisk inland trade is carried on between Norway and Sweden, and between the 
latter and Russia. The imports are chiefly manufactured and colonial goods ; the exports are 
iron, steel, lumber, dried and salted fish, iron wares, cordage, &c. 

19. RevenuCy Populationy &c. The annual revenue of Sweden, arising from the rents of 
crown-lands, capitation taxes, customs, and various other articles, amounts to 4,500,000 dol- 
Ian Tbe national debt has been paid oS. The militaiy force amounts to 40,000 tnexk. 



356 SWEDEN. 

Th e p opulation is 3,200,000. Sweden holds as a colony the island of St. Baitliolomeir, â–  
the West Indies. 

20. Inhabitants, The Swedes are of the middle size, and few of them are corpulent ; idwj 
have ruddy complexions and flaxen hair, though the women often have auburn luiir and bhe 
eyes ; the females are distinguished for beauty. There is little diversity of appearance in the 
Swedes, and they seem to a foreigner rather as members of the same family than natives of a 
large country. All have a very composed demeanor. There are four orders in the state; 
nobles, clergy, peasants, and burghers, or citizens of towns. 

21. Dress. The Swedes have a national di^ss, established by law, libout 60 years ago ; the 
females, however, have little scruple to break this ordinance ; the general color is black, bat on 
gala days, it is blue lined with white. The dress of ladies b somewhat like the English, ex- 
cept in the sleeves, which are Spanish. Veils are common. The coats of the men are short 
and close ; they are fastened around the body with a sash ; the cloak is black, but lined whh 
Â£$yer colors. Galoches or outward shoes are worn in winter, and a fur or sheepskin over-dress 
IS then mdispensable and universal. The peasantry in Dalecarlia are called toAt/e or ibdb, is 
thev are dressed in either color ; and almost all wear one or the other. They wear huge shoes 
with thick wooden soles, and a hat like a quaker's. Generally, in Sweden, the hats ba?ea 
featlier, and no gentleman b in full dress without a sword. The Swedes in general are com- 
fortably and neatly clad. 

S2. Language, The language is a Germano-Gothic dialect, similar to that of Denmark. 

23. Manner of Building, The houses, except at Stockholm and in Scania, are of wood. 
The peasants have log houses, and fill the interstices with moss ; the roof is covered widi 
birchen bark and turf. In summer the floors are sometimes strewed with odorous twigs. In 
the mountains of Dalecarlia, the houses are very simple. Many of the country bouses are of 
several stories, and make a good appearance. Some of them are so constructied, that they maj 
be taken down and removed in a short time. The beds of the common people are placed one 
above another, on shelves, as in the berths of a ship. 

24. Food and Drink, The common people live chiefly on hard bread and salted or dried 
fish ; they consume much beer and spirits, and a great deal of wine b drank by the higher 
classes. The bread is baked but twice a year, and it is hung around the room in small loaves, 
on strings, like dried apples in New England. It is extremelv hard. The brandy is of a Bery 
quality, and no dinner is complete without several glasses. Ladies, even, will take more th^ 
one. Before a dinner, the guests are led to a side-table furnished with liquors and slight food, 
as a preliminary to the more important repast. The dishes are all brought on the table at ODce, 
and the guests do not ask for any particular one. All are circulated in turn, and all are partii' 
ken, unless the guest prefers to sit with an empty plate till hb favorite dish may arrive. After 
dinner, the guests gravely thank the host for his entertainment. The Swedes, like all northern 
people, use much tobacco. 

25. Traveling, The roads of Sweden are hardly inferior to those of England, and die 6- 
cilities for traveling are better than in the other northern countries. The roads are kept in re- 

Eair by the peasants ; each family of which has its portion marked with bounds. Tbe inns 
ave few comforts, though all have a ^^ traveler's room," with a bed, or at least a berdi of 
boards. The horses are small, but active and sure-footed ; they go at full speed down the steep- 
est and largest hills, and are seldom known to stumble, though in the busy seasons they are 
driven by boys or women. The peasants are obliged to fumbh the post-horses, and a travekr 
who would not be delayed at every post-house, sends a forbode or courier, to notify the post- 
masters. There are no public carriages, and all travelers must furnish their own vehicles. At 
the inns are kept registers, in which the traveler writes his name, &c. ; and, as one column is 
made for complaints, it is usual for him to take this opportunity. A second column is appro- 
priated to the innkeeper's defence. These books are curious miscellanies, and display national 
as well as individual character. Acerbi has extracted from one of them the remark of w 
Englishman, that "the Swedes are all slaves, crouching to their masters ;" which is followed 
by a more just and generous exclamation, "God bless this good and brave nation," signed, 
Kosciusko, 

26. Character^ Manners^ and Customs. The Swedes have many amiable traits in their 
character, though they do not lack energy ; they are kind, cheerful, and faithful ; they love 
their country, and are much attached to free institutions and principles of equality. In this and 
in other respects, they sometimes resemble the Swiss. Tbe mountains of Dalecarlia have 



SWEDEN. . . 8ff7 

ahnya been the abode of freedom and â€¢implicity of character. Tbe Swedes are gentle, thot]|^ . 
bnve uid warlike ; and tbe peasanta ate uDconnnonl; civil and obligiag. The people are boS- 
pitable to a great degree, and the character of a granger is a ready passport to their houses. 
Wbea tbe ncher fanulies leave their country-bouses, s room and atteodance is stilt appropriated 
to travelers, who receive as much care as though the master were present. The Swedes are 
descended from the hordes that overran the Roman empire, and they are no less brave and ad- 
venturous than tbeir anceators. In modem times, they have been tbe bulwark of the prolestant 
faith ; and one of their sovereigns bas, with an inconsiderable army, conquered heroes as nu- 
merous and brave as the north ever sent forth to pillage the fertile south. 

27. â€¢Smntements. Tbe 1st of May and midsummer day are celebrated with general joy. 
On the latter occasion, the young men and wo- 
men dance around a pole tiU morning. Dancing 
is common, and all classes dance with great ani- 
mation and agility. Cards are a general amuse- 
ment, though the Swedes are not addicted to 
gaming. All ranks play games at cards ; the 
most common of which is that called Boston. 
It is said (to illustrate the national fondness for 
cards), that a nobleman, when his dinner-hour 
had arrived without the dinner, went into the 
kitchen to learn the reason of the delay ; when 
he found all the domestics engrossed in a game. 
He admitted the characteristic excuse, that the 
ANte cMrattef MdMMmmm- O^ S,'^^ Â«"Â« f '^ ^""Ost critical point, and COuW 

not, therefore, be, deferred, even for dinner; 
but be took the cook's band, and played it, while that domestic performed his duty. 

23. Education. There are a good many elementary schools, and education is as generally 
difiused as in Switzerland. There are few who cannot read and write. There are 2 univer- 
sities, one at Upsala, and the other at Lund. 

29. StiUe of tht â€¢Srts, Scunce, and Literature. The Swedes, with some other northern 
nations have an ancient literature, the Scandinavian, which has been noticed under tbe bead of 
Iceland. In modern umes, they have done mucb for science, in which many branches have 
been simplified and much advanced by Linnieus. Works of merit are translated into tbe 
Swedish language, in which tbe original works are chiefly scientific. There are several learned 
societies in Sweden. Sergei, a sculptoi* of great merit, lefl many monuments of his art in 
Sweden. He is one of the best of tbe northern sculptors. 

30. RiUgion. The religion is Lutheran, and the Swedes are generally a devout peopte. 

31 . Government. This is a limited hereditary monarchy. The Diet has some resemblance 
to the British Parliament, and it is composed of 4 bodies, which meet in different bouses, vix. 
the nobles, the clergy, tbe peasants, and the burghers or inhabitants of towns. 

32. History. Sweden and Norway seem originally to have been peopled by Finnic tribes. 
Tbe Gothic chiefs who conquered this country, assumed the title of Kings of Upsala, in the 
5tb century ; but the Goths and Swedes remained distinct tribes for some centuries afterward. 
The whole peninsula was subject to Denmark in the I4tb century, but in tbe 16tb Gustavus 
Vasa delivered Sweden from the Danish yoke, and was elected king by his countrymen. Tbe 
Reformation was soon after introduced into the country, and in the religious wars of tbe t7th 
century, the Swedes, under their king Gustavus Adolphus, gained a brilliant military reputation. 
CbarlÂ« tbe Twelfth, in the beginning of tbe 18th century, after adding to this celebrity by a 
series of victories, which exhausted tbe blood and treasures of his subjects, was defeated at 
Pultowa by the Russians, and obliged to take refuge in the Ottoman dominions. Norway) 
wbicli bad previously belonged to Denmark, was annexed to Sweden in 1814. 



LAPLAND. 
CHAPTER LIU. LAPLAND. 



1. BotmdarUt and Extenf. Lapland is bounded north by the Arcdc Ocean, east hj ibe 
White Sea, south by Sweden, and west by Norway and the Atlantic. It extends from 66Â° 
to 71Â° N. lat., and from 15Â° to 40^ E. long., and contains about 130,000 square miles. 

2. Moutilaiiu, Laket, and Riven. Lapland is not interserted by very high mountains ; mi 
IS crolVned only on its western frontier by a mountainous chain, that fonns tbs extrunily of iba 
Scandinavian Alps. The rif er Tortua s|)ringB from the take of the same name, and, after i 
course of 300 miles, falls into the Gulf of Bothnia. The Tana and ^Itett foil into the Fnaeo 
OceAn. The lakes in Lapland are numerous ; the Great Lakt, Tomea, LuUa, and fnoro, 
are distinguished for their romantic scenery. 

3. Climate. In point of temperature, Lapland may be divided into two regions, the mbod 
tnd the maritime. In ibe former, the winter is very severe, and the summer very hot. In 
the latter, the winter is comparatively mild, and the summer cold. During the summer nl- 

Btice, when the sun con* 
tinues for weeks together 
below the horizon, then 
is only a twilight of Â» few 
hours, instead of a clot 
daylight. These itaij 
nights are, however, in 
some degree, compensi- 
ted by the aurora borei- 
lis, which gleams bere 
with uncommon splen- 
dor. 

4. Soil The soil is 
generally sterile. Tbe 
greater pan of the coon- 
try is covered with rocb, 
peats, or moss, and gn*- 
elly plains. There are i 
few tracts tolerably good 
JaTÂ«r* Bortalit. in the southern pats' 

Tbe trees are tbe fifi 
\ birch, larch, and small beech, which form vast, but not very thick, forests. 

5. Vegetable Prodw:tiotu. Even these drearv r^ions, though strongly contrasted with 
more favored climes, have useful products. The spruce and Scotch firs cease to thrin 
at about 7CÂ°, the aspen and the bird cherry reach somewhat further, and the birch un 
mountain ash to yet higher latitudes. Beyond, the dwarf willow and birch, no longer tree!, 
but shrubs, of fi or 6 feel high, brave the ngors of the frigid sone. The Iceland moss (LitiM 



UJandieni), reindeer moss, cudbear (L. larlareut), collected for the dyeri, the crotvfOM.' 
(ranwKuIw) , saxifrages, cranberry (mM|ietrum), ibg, wbter-greeD, &c. are amoDg the teat 
remnants of expiring vegetation. The root of the calla palustris, a plant of a poisonous 
family^, affords toe Laplanders a kind of substitute for bread, called Missenbrod, or bread o( 
Uaaae. 

6. J^neraia. Lapland abounds in metals and minerals. Native gold has been found at 
. Svappawara ; copper, iron, lead, zinc, and plumbago are found in various parts. Limestone, 

mubLa, gypsum, rock-crystal, jasper, amethysts, and garnets, are also among the mineral pro- 
ductions of ibis country. 

7. ^nimaU. The reindeer is the most useful animal to the Laplander, and seems to have 
been provided by nature to recompense him for the want of tbe other comforts of life. In 
siHnmer it provides itself with leaves and grass, and in winter lives upon moss ; and its milk 
and flesh afford excellent nutriment, while its skin forms the chief clothing of its master. Its 
speed is scarcely credible ; for it can run 300 miles in a day. In a kind of sledge, shaped 
like B small boat, and with tbe reins fastened to the horns of the deer, the traveler may joum^ 
irhh ease almost any distance. Besides this animal, bears, wolves, lynxes, and beavers are 
lAiea met widl in Lapland. Innumerable insects are produced in summer ; and tbe inbabitantt 
â– re infested with mosquitoes to an intolerable degree. 

8. .Sgrieuihirt. Except in a few sheltered valleys, and on the banks of tbe rivers in the 
southern districts, there is liide cultivation. The grain which grows best, and is chiefly sows, 
is barley, or rather bi^ ; and oats are raised in small quantiues. The tobacco plant flourisbea 
welt. 

9. CoMmerce. The Laplanders carry on some trade in the skins and furs of quadrupeds ; 
Ncfa as ermines, sables, squirrels, foxes, bears, lynxes, and wolves, which they transport from 



TYtaelittginUplMid. â–  T^adiÂ»i Ompauy i^f Uplanden. 

tbe interior to the coast by means of (heir reindeer. In return, they receive meal, cloth. 
Tirious utensils, spirituous liquors, &c. As tbe furs are of extreme fineness, tbey bear a bigli 
price. 

10. PopvUUion. Lspland is very thinly peopled. The whole population probably does 
BM exceed 60,000. 

11. hhabitanU. The Laplanders are generally short in stature, and they have sharp chins 
uA prominent cheek bones. Tliey differ from the Fins in having dark hair, though the com- 
plexions are freouantly light. They have a tolerable share of strength, with great suppleness 
ifid ^iliIy, and tney endure much hardship with patience. 

13. Drtu. The materials are generally the skins of animals ; though \hi Laplanders who 
have permanent habitations, wear in summer, woolen stuffs, and shirts, which the wandering 
-'"'â– â– - â€” n lave not. The men wear a conical cap, and in hunting, a hood, covering the 



breat and shoulders, and witli only a small opening for the eyes. They rarelv wear any cov- 
ering round their necks, which are exposed in tbe severest weather, or defended only by a 
piece of wrrow cloth, going once rouod- Tbey wear a tunic, or short cost of sheep-skio.

pocket, but hangs a smalt bag at bis breast, in which he puts his Utile implements. The glovu 
are of skins, and lined with cypress grass. There are no stockings, and the pantsloons do dm 
reach to the ankle. Instead of stockings, straw ad 
rushes are stuffed into the shoe, around the foot lad 
ankle. The men wear leathern belts. The dresi of 
the women is not very dissimilar to that of the dkb. 
At night, even when the cold is most intense, lbs 
mountain Laplanders go to bed naked, and coret 
themselves with their .dress and skins. Tbej pa 
tbeir feet within a baic. 

13. Language. The language is entirely distinct 
from any other, except the Finnic, to which it bis 
some analogy. 

14. Manner of Building. The Laplanders lire 
in Imis, or, in summer, in tents. The huts are lo 
small, that the people cannot stand upright, except in 

ibe centre. They are built of sods and stone, and covered with bushes, turf, and e*A 
The household lumtture consists tn iron or copper ketdes, and wooden cups, bowls, ui 
spoons. Some of the wealthy have tin, and even silver basins. 

15. Fbod and Drink, The reindeer supplies the cg ti articles of food, though 5oiiiedl|l| 
w obtained by fishing and hunting. In summer, the reit Jeer's milk is boiled with sorrel to I 
consistence, and is thus preserved; in winter, it is kept frozen in the paunch of a reindMTi 
and mixed with cranberries. It is broken up with a hatchet. When cheese is made, At 
milk is mixed with water, otherwise it is too rich to curdle. The rennet is the sound of the 
codfish. In winter, the mountain Laplanders slaughter one or two reindeers weekly, accoi^ 
lo the numbers of a family. The marrow is boiled out as a present for the missionary. On 
die seacoast, there is some beef and mutton ; besides whicn, the Laplanders eat aU flesh, 
except that of swine ; but pork is to them an abomination. Little bread is used ; but ibe 
Hiner bark of the fir-tree, and the roots and leaves of the herb anselics, are eaten with avidity. 
The great luxury of a Laplander is tobacco ; abd he will even chew strips of the hag, or chin 
of the cask, that has held it. Brandy is indeed a great favorite with the people, but it is too 
scarce for any, but for occasional indulgence. The office of cook in all ils branches is filled 
by men, and in this the women never interfere. 

16. Diaetutt. The only epidemic is a colic, attended with spasms, but it ts oot fatal ; chro- 
nic disorders, fevers, and dysenteries, are unknown. Chilblains are frequent, but ih geoo' 
ibe Laplanders are free from disease. Â« 

17. Traveling. The Laplanders travel on sledges, drawn by the reindeer, as befwa da- 
scribed. In ducendmg bilu, in winter, long skates are worn. With ifaese the Laplmlen

descend the steep moimuins so twiftly , tbM . 
the lir whistles in tlieir ears, and their hiiir 
becomes erect with the downward motion. 

18. CAorocter, JUanntri^ and Ctalomt- 
In Lapland, society exists in its primitive 
elements ; men lire in a state differing from 
that of highly civilized countries ; there are 
no crimes, and there is a perfect security ot . 
property. The settlements are not near to 
each other ; and whoever erects a hut with- 
out the limits of another, becomes possessed 
of the land for 6 miles around. There is 
no temptation to commit the crimes of vio- 
lence or fraud, that are so common in other 
countries, and a lock as a security to proper- 
LtpUnd Sitmo-tkott. ty is unknown in Lapland. The Laplanders 

are gentle and hospitahle, and like the F.squt- 
mam, tbey have the greatest aversion to war. A Laplander has never been known as a soldier. 
The people resist all inducements to leave their country. Tbey are not without sensitive feel- 
ings, end are known to weep from sympathy and compassion. 

19. tdMuwnuntt. The Laplanders are expert wrestlers, and they have several athletic 
sports. Tbey throw javelins at a mark, leap over sticks held by two persons, &c. They have 
the game of fox ai>d geese, which is in great request. 

SO. Rtl^itm. The Laplaaders have renounced theii pagan creed, though some of its rites 
â– od superstitions iremain. They aUend to the instructions of the missionaries with great atten- 
tioo aod seriousness. Tbey never use profane language, and they observe the Sabbath stricdy- 
Id 1738, the Bible was translated into their language, and there are now Lutheran bymn-hool^, 
tracts, &c. Since the first translation of the Bible, a second and third have been made. 
There are 33 churches, and 7 schools, chiefly under the care of the missionaries. 

Marriages and funerals are not conducted with much ceremony. The family and friends of a 
young man, go in a body to solicit, in court- 
ship for him, and presents are made. Should 
the parents of the female retract their consent, 
the presents are restored, and even the brandy 
that was drank, is replaced. 

The Laplanders make professions of sorce- 
ry, and the females sometimes are distinguish- 
ed as witches. Their mode of divination is 
with the Runic drum, and by a system of 
omens. The pagan superstitions are, howev- 
er, gradually becoming extinct. 

21. Divitioni- Lapland is divided be- 
tween Sweden and Russia. Swedish Lap- 
land occupies the southwestern quarter of ttus 
country, and is divided into 4 lapmarks, or 
Wtiimg Partm. provinces ; Russian Lapland forms the eastern 

part, and is included in the government of 
Archangel ; Norw^an Lapland extends the whole length of the Sevemoi, on their northern 
tide, end forms the province of Finmark. A large portion of the Laplanders are practically 
nnder do government whatever 

CHAPTER LIV. FINLAND. 

1. Botutdariet and Extetd. Finland is bounded north by Lapland, east by Russia, south 
if the Gulf of Finland, and west by the Gulf of Bothnia. It lies between 22Â° and 32Â° east 
laipliide, and extends south to latitude 60Â° ; the DÂ«tbert\ linut is not very distincdy marked, 
k cootaim 136,000 squire miles. 



3. MtmntaiiUy RwÂ«n, and Laktt. A tnct of table-tand in tbe interior, extant iatif 
cliviCy [oward the shore of the Gulf of Bothnia. There are other ranges ia tbe eastern piiti, 
but xhej have not been explored. The country is intersected by an immense number of likei, 
giving rise to many rivers, but none of them are of great leoztb, and the shallows, and can- 
racts which they contain, render them useless for Davigation. The Paytmit, or PeoMoilt hki, 
in the central part of the country, is 170 miles long, and 13 broad. The lake of Sidatr, a 
the eastern part, is 250 miles long, and 22 broad, snd is crowded with islands. It commai- 
cates wirb lake Ladoga, by the river Woxa, which falls over 6 cataracts. The coasts m 
rocky, and strewn with small isltuids, separated by narrow and intricate channels. 

3. Climate. In the north, the climate resembles that of Lapland. In the south the tbei^ 
momeier seldom falls so low as S5Â° below zero ; and the crops are exposed in summer to Â»â–  
cessive droughis. 

4. Soil and Production!. Tbe soil is more productive than might be inferred from the ge- 
ographical position of the country. It is for the most part a vegetable mould, and exceedin^lj 
moist. Forests, similar to those of Sweden and Lapland, are abundant. Iron was formed; 
produced here, but no mines are worked at present. The country furnishes great quantities a 
[dtre. 

5. Face of the Country. Tbe northern part is hilly. The eastern part is covered witii 
â– and-hills and rocks, and intersected by marshes, lakes, and rivers, which oiffiue cold and m* 
wholesome mists. 

6. Divisiont and Toant. Finland is divided into 7 circles. Viborg, Kymesegard, Ti- 
rastebuus, Abo, Kuopio, Vasa, and Uleaborg. Helangfori, the capital, is situMed on i1m 
Gulf of Finland, and has a good harbor, and considerable commerce. The univeruty hn 
been removed to this place from Abo, since the destruction of the latter place by fire. Popn- 
Iltion, 8.000. Helsingfors conuins a naval arsenal, but is chiefly important from tbe vicinity 
c^ Sweaoorg, the Northern Gibraltar. The fortress consists of 3 ialjnds, connected by bridges, 
mounts BOO cannon, and has accommodations for 12,000 men. 

.Sbo, at the entrance of the Gulf of Bothnia, was formerly tbe capital. It was <Â»ie of ibt 
most agreeable towns in the countir, and had manufactures of silk and woolen, sfaip-buildii^, 
and sugar refineries, with a population of 12,000 ; but it was almost totally destroyed by fire, in 
1827. Siborg was (he capital of the former Russian Finland, and of ell western Russii, till 
the building of St, Petersburg. 

7. fahfmtantt. The Finlanders are of small stature, light complexions, and fair hair, worn 



FiÂ»laadtr's Hautt. 

uncombed down each side of the face ; they are sharp featured, and generally without anj ip 
parent heard. The appearance of one differs little from that of anodier. They wear woolen 
Kaftans, short to the knee, with loose black pantaloons and caps. The women wear a Niw 
pobe over their clothes. 

The houses of the peasants are well built and comfortable. The genoa! food is milk, sw 
herring, and salt meat. The Finlanders are cheerful, kind, and veiy hospitable. A ttni^ 
receives much attention. He is always the principal person in a compMoy, and much paina u* 



BEPUBLK3 OF OEIACOW. 38* 

ttdeen to pleise faini. When he has sticceeded in rendering himself agreeable, it is a etmtotat 
at an assemblage for all the women present to give him a sudden slap on the back, when it ta 
least expected ; and the compliment is in proportion to the weight of the Mow. 

8. Edncc^bm, Education is much less diffused than in Sweden, though there is a universi* 
ty at Helsingfors. 

9. Jlmusements. Amusements are not fare among so cheerful a people, though they are not 
much given to dancing. They have many athletic sports, and the bear dance^ from the strength 
required, may be considered one. It is practbed sometimes by the peasants. It is perform- 
ed on all foursy or the dancer rests on his hands as well as feet, and by leaps and jumps keeps 
ttme with the music. It is so fatiguing, that the dancer in a few minutes fails into a violent per- 
spiration. The peasants shoot the rifle with much skill, and seldom miss the smallest mark. 
They hunt the wild animab in various ways, and engage the most dangerous of them singly, 
and fearlessly. They sing to the harpu^ or sort of harp ; two men sitting opposite, with locked 
hands, accompany the song with alternate verses, raising each other alternately from their seats. 

The violin is not uncommon^ and the Finlanders have some turn for poetry as well as mu- 
sic. Every event of public or private interest, finds a poet to celebrate it. The poets con- 
dole with friends at a death, and rejoice -with them at marriages. They have also satires and 
tales. Almost all the peasants have a house built for the purposes of a bath, which they use 
generally, and with little regard to delicacy. It is a small chamber in which are a number of 
stones. These are heated till they become red-hot, when water is thrown upon them, and the 
company is involved in a cloud of vapor. The bathers rub themselves and lash their bodies 
widi twies, till they become red with scourging. In winter they go from the bath, which is so 
hot that It is barely tolerable, and roll themselves in the snow. This they do m the coldest 
days. 

10. ReUgion. ' The religion is Lutheran, but there are some pagan superstitions. There 
are charms for the bite of a serpent, for scalds, burns, wounds, &c. ; diseases are supposed by 
many to be the effect of witchcraft. The marriages are attended with ceremony and rejoicing. 

11. ^griculturey &c. The inhabitants cultivate barley and rye, and fell timber. The fir 
trees of the interior afford great quantities of tar ; and potash is manufactured to some extent. 
The products of the forest are sufficiently abundant for exportation. Fisheries are largely 
carried on. 

12. Government^ Population, &c. Finland is a portion of the Russian Empire, with the 
title of a government. The population is 1,350,000. The prevailing religion is Lutheran. 
The country was formerly a province of Sweden, but came into the possession of Russia in 
1809. 



CHAPTER LV. LATEREPOBLIC OF CRACOW. 

This republic consisted of a territory of 500 square miles, formerly a part of Poland, and 
now surrounded by the Russian and Austrian territories. The country is a plain, extending 
along the banks of the Vistula, which becomes navigable immediately under the walls of the 
capital. The soil is fertile, and the climate warmer than in the rest of Poland. The general 
appearance of the country is picturesque. The city of Cracow is the capital, and was once 
the capital of Poland. It has a large dilapidated castle, and a cathedral remarkable for its 50 altars 
and 20 chapels, and as the burial-place of many of the kings of Poland. Here are 70 churches 
and several magnificent convents. The streets are irregular. The city contains a large square, 
but the buildings which surround it are mean. The university is a magnificent edifice, and is 
the most ancient seminary in Poland. A remarkable monument has lately been erected here in 
honor of Kosciusko ; it consists of a mound, called Mogila Kosciusko, or Kosciusko's Mount, 
300 feet in height, and 275 feet in diameter at the base. Population, of the city, 26,000. 
Kre$toÂ»iee has a population of 4,000. KrzanOy 1,300. The whole population oT the repub- 
Ec was 150,000. 

The chief production is srain. The agriculture is superior to that of the other Polish coun- 
tries, yet in bad seasons tne land does not produce sufiScient com for the subsistence of the 
inhabitants. Cattle are raised in considerable numbers. Fruits are reared in the neighborhoorl 
ef the capital, and the vegetables are in high reputation. At Kressovice are several iron work^ 



ai4 POLAND. 

but there are no other manufactares except domestie ftbrics. The gOFeronieiit is an aristooit. 
ical republic. The assembly or legislative body coosbts of the representatives of the corpo- 
rations, the clergy, and the university ; the executive authority is vested in a senate chosen fei 
life by the assembly, and a president chosen by the same body for two years. The chief 
magistrate is a President, chosen every 3 years. The revenue is 133,248 dollars ; theddt 
10,000 dollars. The inhabitants are mostly Poles, and the Polish language is every where pie- 
dominant. The religion is Roman Catholic, but all sects are tolerated. There is no distinc- 
tion of rank among the inhabitants, except that the members of the chapter of the cadiednl 
and of the university possess a few unimportant privileges. 

This little community owed its existence to the disputes of the three despotic powers, that 
partitioned the kingdom of Poland. In 1815, when the final destiny of Poland was decided at 
the congress of Vienna, the Austrian and Russian monarchs respectively laid claim to the city 
and territory of Cracow, situated at the point where the newly acquired territories of these two 
powers join those of Prussia. To this fortunate position, Cracow wss indebted for its exemp* 
tion from the fate of the rest of Poland. The holy aUies, unable to determine which of their 
number had the best right to the territory, resolved that neither should possess it ; and Cn- 
eow was declared a republic under the protection of tl^ three surrounding powers. ButinlB46 
it was annexed to Austria. 

CHAPTER LVI. POLAND. 

> 

1. Boundaries and ExletU. The late kingdom of Poland b bounded north by Prussia* 
east by Russia, south by Galicia and Cracow, and west by Prussia. It is nearly a square of 
200 miles in extent, and contains 48.000 square miles. 

2. Rivers, This country is intersected by the Vistula and its head streams, the Bng^ JV*a- 
rew, and Pelica. The JNTteman forms a part of the northern boundary. There are a ?ariety 
of smaller streams, and the country is in general well watered. 

3. Soilj Productionsy &c. The soil is generally thin and sandy. There are many marshy 
tracts, and the face of the country is diversified with fruitful fields, steppes, heattis, impenetra- 
ble forests, and wide moors. The forests are sometimes 15 or 20 miles in extent, and a great 
part of the country is covered with wood. The general aspect of the country is that of aa 
onbounded plain ; there is hardly a hill or mountain in the whole territory. Poland^ io the 
Sclavonian language, signifies a plain, or flat country. The climate is everywhere temperate^ 
but as the land lies open to the north wind, the air is not so mild as in the neighboring parts of 
Germany. 

4. Divisions. This kingdom is divided into eight palatinates or waiwodships : Cracovia, 
Sandomir, Kalisch, Lublin, Plock, Masovia, Podlachia, and Augustow. 

5. Cities. fVarsatVy the capital, stands on a bank of the Vistula, on a rising ground. It is 
very irregularly built, and has several suburbs, the principal of which is Praga, with which it is 
connected by a pontoon bridge. The city presents a heterogeneous aspect. It has above 100 
splendid palaces, surrounded by a mass of wretched huts. Streets of noble dimensions, kA 
adorned with edifices in the finest Italian style, are contrasted with groups of beggarly woodeo 
piles, threatening every moment to fall. The palace of Sigismund is very spacious, and has a 
colossal bronze statue of the Emperor Sigismund the Third. The Marieville is a large build- 
ing, constructed on the plan of the Palais Royal, at Paris, and contains the exchange, and up- 
wards of 300 booths, for the sale of goods. Warsaw contains a university and several cob- 
vents and hospitals. Its population is as grotesque as its architecture, and resembles a perpet- 
ual masquerade ; long-bearded Jews ; monks in the garb of every order ; veiled and shrouded 
nuns, self secluded and apart ; bevies of young Polesses, in silk mantles of the brightest 
colors, promenading the broad squares ; the venerably ancient Polish noble, with mustaches, 
eaftan, girdle, sabre, and red or yellow boots ; the new generation equipped to the highest pitch 
of Parisian dandyism, with Turks, Greeks, Russians, Italians, Germans, and Frenchmen, io 
an ever-changing throng. Warsaw has a considerable conomerce by the Vistula, and roanuSK' 
Uires of cloth, linen, carpets, stockings, carriages, and harnesses. The population is about 
150,000, including the garrison and 30,000 Jews. The other towns of Poland are small. 
Kalisch is a handsome and regularly built city, with manufactures of cbth and linen : popuh- 
lion, 10,000. Lublin has a population of 12,000 souls. 

6. Jlgrictdture. Poland is a country of great agricultural resources. The productions aia 



POLAND. SaS 

eoTD) catde, hemp, and flax! The greater pan of the territory is extremelj well adapted to 
the rearing of sheep. The plains annually overflowed by the Vistula, afford perhaps the rich- 
est pasturage in Europe. Notwithstanding these natural advantages, the agricultural industry of 
tbe country has been ereatly reduced by political oppression. About han the territory is cul* 
tirated ; one fourth of the remainder is occupied by forests, and the remainder by marshes and 
waste lands. 

7. Commerce. The principal trade is in the exportation of com, which is conveyed down 
the Vistula to Dantzic, in large flat boats. Ths exportation is considerable ; the exporters are 
Jews, who are the only capitalists in the country. 

8. Population^ â€¢Army, &c. The population is about 4,100,000. The Polish army pre- 
Tioas to the insurrection in 1830, was fixed at 50,000 men, and every Pole, without distmc- 
tion of birth or religion, was obliged to serve as a soldier, from the age of 20 to 30, although 
members of the liberal profession, elder sons of families, and state olQScers, were exempted, and 
any individual might serve by substitute. 

9. Inhabitants, The Poles have an Asiatic cast of countenance, derived, probably, from 
tbe Tartars. They are tall, and well formed, with eood features, and often with fair complex- 
ions. The inhabitants may be divided into Poles, Jews, Germans, and Russians ; and, again, 
into four classes ; nobles, clergy, burghers, and peasants. The nobles have the titles of Prince, 
Count, and Baron. All, however, are equal by birth, and the only distinction is that of office. 
The nobles are exceedingly numerous, and generally poor ; of these there are 60,000 families. 
Tbe peasants are, in effect, slaves, though their condition is becoming better, and many have 
been manumitted. They have a conditional estate in the land they till ; and generally render 
in return to the landlord, three days' labor in the week. Dwarfs are said to be more common 
in Poland than in any other country. 

10. Dress. The dress is national ; though in Poland may be seen the costumes of various 
nations. The heads of the men are shaven, all but a circle on the crown, and all wear musta- 
ches. A vest is worn, reaching to the middle of the leg, a gown lined with fur, and girded 
with a sash, and wide breeches, of a piece with the stockings. The shirts are without collars 
or wristbands, and neither stock nor neckcloth is worn. Boots are worn with thin soles. This 
is the dress of the gentry, and the female costume does not essentially vary from it. The men 
wear fur caps, and a hanger is indispensable to a gentleman. The Jews wear a tall cap of fur 
over one ot velvet, and a long tunic of black silk, girded with a wide sash. All suffer their 
beards to grow. The peasants are often clothed but with rags. They wear in winter a coat 
of sheep-skin, with the fur inward ; and in summer a coarse cloth. Their boots are frequently 
but the rind of trees, wrapped about their legs, with a thicker piece of bark for tbe sole. 

1 1 . Manner of Building, The Polish towns are generally built around a square, with a 
town-house in the middle. The dwellings of the peasants are mean huts of wood, of one story, 
and with a single room for men and cattle. There is a stove in every house. 

12. Food and Drink. The tables of the wealthy are well supplied, but the food of the 
poor is scanty and coarse. The peasants live mostly upon black rye bread, potatoes, cab- 
bage, and peas. They eat litde animal food, though they use much salt. Schnapsy or a coarse 
kind of whisky, is taken by the peasants, when they can obtain it, to excess. 

IS. Diseases. The small-pox continues to commit occasional ravages, and siphilis is com- 
mon. It is the bane of the country, and of 100 recruits 80 have been known to have it. The 
pUca polonica is a peculiar and national disease. It is occasioned by humors, which seem to 
have no other outlet but the hair. It is often fatal to cit off the hair during the disease, which, 
if suflered to run, exhausts itself in a few months, when the hair is cut off and a new growth 
comes. It becomes, during the disease, matted and endued with life, and will bleed when cut 
off. The disease is offensive but not dangerous. It is, however, sometimes fatal to the do- 
mestic animals, that have long hair. 

14. Traveling. Hardship and privation must be suffered by the traveler in Poland. The 
ims are kept by the Jews, and they contain but one room ; and this of such a kind, that a 
lodgii^ is often preferred in the stable' Neither beds nor provision are always to be had, and 
the traveler generally carries both. The usual traveling- carriage is made of wicker work, in 
tbe form of a cradle. 

15. Character, Manners, and Customs. The Poles are distinguished for bravery, military 
spirit, and impatience of control. They are honorable, hospitable, courteous, and lively, but 
aot whhout licentiousness. The rich nobles live in much state, and entertain their friends, and

tinues to be considerably cultivated ; and English works have grown into favor, ebove tk 
French, which were formerly the most popular. 

18. Religion. The Catholic is the established religion, but all others are tolerated, and the 
Greek church is organized. There is a considerable number of recluses. 

19. Education. Since 1815 tbe lower classes have received some attention in point of edu- 
cation i but they are still very ignorant. Before that time, all education was mcmopoliiecl Ly 
the nobles. There are now few schools in villages, and those m towns are not very efficIenL 

30. Gottmmtnt. Poland is a dependency of Russia, the emperor of which is Eiing of 

Poland. Previous to tbe insurrection of 1830, there was a diet assembled once in tiro yam, 

consisting of a Senate and Chamber of Pepuiies ; hut even this shadow of liberty bas been 

taken away, and tbe government of Poland is now despotic in forni, as well as in subfiance. 

An imperial Russian ukase incorpoiaid ibe 

kingdom of Poland wilb Russia, in iS32,

a Russian governor-general.

tilions, in 1772, 1793, end 1795. Al 
tbe last partition the kiilg was deposed, 
the country blotted from the list of ra- 
tions, and the whole territory divided 
between the three powers above men-

The Poles ramaiaed in quiet submiuton to the Ruasian goremnieat till 1830, whea, od the 
29tb of Novendter, Warsaw rose ia insurrection, aod the whole kingdom was speedily in revdi. 
The hope of assistance from some of the free goveraments of Europe induced them to spwn 
at all attempts on the part of the Russian emperor to bring them to submission, and a bloodf 
stni^le, with the armies of the auWcrat, followed. The Poles at first obtained some eignal 
advantages, but no foreign power stirred in their behalf, the Russians poured in fresh armies, 
and, in a year from the breaking out of the revolt, Poland was overpowered by nunibers aad 
forced again to submit. The Russian despotism is now fully reestablished, and unhappy Po- 
land has felt its bitterest persecutions. Many of the Poles were murdered in cold blood by 
the victors, and others, with their families,, were dragged in chains, or driven with the loeb, to 
tbe distant wilds of Siberia. 



CHAPTER LVII. RUSSIAN EMPIRE. 



St. Ptttnturg. 

1. Boundaries and Extent, This pountry is bounded north by tbe Frozen Ocean, east.by 
Asiatic Russia, south by the Caspian Bea, Caucasus, Sea of Azof, the Black Sea, and the 
Danube, and west by Moldavia, Austria, Poland, Prussia, the Baltic, Finland, and Lapland. 
It extends from 40Â° to 70Â° N. latitude, end from 31Â° to 68Â° E. longitude, and conlains about 
1,800,000 square miles.* 

3. Jlfountaim. The Ural Mountatm form the boundary between Europe and Asia. They 
consist of 8 chain 1 ,S00 miles in length, extending from the Frozen Ocean, south, nearly to 
the Caspian Sea. The Finnic MovtUains are a continuation of the Scandinavian range, and 
extend some distance into Russia between the White Sea and the Gulf of Bothnia. The 
^launian Mountains are a series of gentle elevations southeast of the Gulf of Finland. In 
tbe south are the J^ountains of Taunda. 

3. Riven. Russia is watered by a great number of rivers, comprising the largest in Europe. 
The Ural rises on the eastern declivity of the Uralian mountains, separates Europe from Asia, 
and empties its waters, after a course of 1,300 miles, into the Caspian Sea. The Volga, tbe 
largest river of Europe, rises in the government of Tver, and, passing in an easterly and i^outh- 
erly direction by Tver, Jaroslav, Kazan, and Astrachan, it flows into the Caspian Sea, by 70 
mouths. Its principal tributaries are the Oka from the west, and the Kama, a full, deep 
stream, from the east ; its current isgentle and smooth, and it is navigated by more than 5,000 
boats, while its valuable sturgeon fisheries employ even a greater number of fishing craft. 
Length of its course, 2,500 miles. The Terek and Kuma are considerable streams rising in 
the Caucasian Mountains, and Sowing into the Caspian Sea.

13 a course of nearly 1,000 miles, passing by Smolensk, Kiev, below nhichihe 

interrupted by falls, Cherson, and Oczacow, into tbe Black Sea. The Dniiiir, 

!7arpathiaD mountains of Galicia, abo runs into the Black Sea. 

la passes through Poland into Prussia, and the Alemen also enters tbe Pnujin 

territory. The Duna, or Southern 7>tnmi, rising near the sources of the Volga, flom aonb 

if Livonia. The JWva, tbe outlet of Lake LadogS*, is more remarkable far fte 

ivaters, than the length of its course ; it is a broad, full, deep river, and bmk- 

at mischief by its inundations. The Petchora, the Dwina, and the OnegK, itt 

treams, whose waters find their way into the Arctic Ocean. 

This country abounds in lakes. The Lake of Ladoga lies near the Oilf iT 

130 miles long, and 65 broad. It abounds in fish, and particularly in sei]i,ad 

'itb the sea by a canal. Lake Onega, lies between this lake and the WbiieSll; 

lone. The other lakes are smaller. 

Jm>a Zembla consists of two lai^e islands in tbe Arctic Ocean, prescatiigi 

irile appearance, and covered with snow and ice the greater part of the jtt- 

ices some shrubs and moss ; the islands are uninhabited by man, but they mmi 

mine, white hears, seals, and fish, and are mucb resorted to by fishemtea ai 

tbe northwest is the rocky and mountainous group of Spitzbergtn, where la d- 

wintef reigns. The white bear, whales, seals, &c., abound here ; a compaD^ 

nerchants have attempted to establish a fishing and hunting post here, oa ihe 

most northerly inhabited spot on the globe. 

6. iSeu and Gulfi. The If kite Sea in the north communicates with tbe Frozen Ocen 
It is sufficiently deep for navigation and is free from ice from July till winter. Tbe Gidjtj 
Finland is an arm of the Baltic, extending easterly between Russia and Finlaod. Tbe Sea Â«/ 
â€¢Uxof, in tbe south, is an arm of the Black Sea. 

7. Climate. Tbe While Sea, and the ocean which washes tbe nortbem coast, are covwed 
with ice Irom September to June, and the rivers in this quarter are frozen for a still lot^ 
penod. In tbe morasses and lakes, the frost seldom disappears at all, and the sun's beatiloei 
not penetrate a span into the marshy soil. During the brief <iad cheerless summer the. itans- 
pbere is loaded with fogs. The sun at this season appears like an enormous red balloon, bm- 
ing motionless in the air. The summer is damp, not, and oppressive. At Petersburg, lie 
temperature is milder, but the Neva is frozen from November till March. In the souib, ibe 
climate is defightful, and vegetation is flourishing. Id the plains, there is little rain in summer, 
and tbe streams dry up. 

8. Soil. Tbe country watered by the Volga b tolerably fertile, but the richest districts re 
those upon tbe Don and Dnieper. In Livonia tbe soil is excellent. In tbe north, the soil is 
unfit for tillage. 

9. Natural ProditcHons. In the north, firs, junipers, and mosses, are all the produclims 
of the soil. The central parts abound in forests of linden, cherry, elm, birch, willow, popla, 
alder, aspen, maple, pine, cedar, and cypress. Upon the shores of the Black Sea grow tbe 
turpentine tree, the balm and Byzantine poplar. Walnut trees are plentiful in the Crimei- 

10. Minerali- The European part of Russia Is not rich in minerals. Iron and marble ue 
found in some parts, granite is abundant, and salt occurs in large quantities. 

1 1 . JinimaU. In the north are found most of the animals described in the adjoining cout' 
tries. In all tbe other parts sheep are abundant. Wild horses are found in tb&steppffioi 
the Don. 

12. Fact of the Country. The whole region is for the most part a champaign country, "ii'i 
very few mountainous tracts. It abounds in those great level plains, called tUppa, sometiiM 
resembling deserta, and at other times savannas, waving with luxuriant grass. 

13. Divitiont. European Russia is divided into 50 governments or provinces, eiclusiie 
of the territory of the Cossacks of the Don, which forms a sort of military republic ; the pw* 
duchy of Finland, which baa a distinct administration, and the kingdom of Poland. Tbe 
Mographical sections are, the Baltic provinces, comprising 4 governments, and Finland ; Gkh 
Russia, including 19 governments ; Little Russia, comprising 4 governments ; Southern HusM 



eooMiningS gorcrtMients, md tba province of BesMnbHi ; Westsm Rassta, composeJ of T 
gOTemmoDU and 1 province ; and Eoatem Russia, comprising 8 governmeots.* 

14. Tovtu. St. PeUnbtirg, the metropolis of the Russian empire, is situated at the eait- 
ern extremity of the Oulf of Finland, and is built partly upon the mainland, and partly upoa 
some small islands near the mouth of the Neva ; one of its entrances is adorned with a m^- 
â– t6cent triumphal arch. ' The foundation c^ the city is extremely marshy, and so lov u tÂ»

subject the city to frequent inundations from the waters of the gulf.f It was founded in 1703, 
by Peter the Great, the spot being then occupied only by a few fishermen's huts. The stresti 
of the city are from 70 to 150 feet wide, and are mosdy intersected by spacious canals, ent- 
banked by parapets of hewn stone, and 
spanned at convenient distances by arched 
bridges of magnificent construction. The 
quays along the Neva are remarkably magnifi- 
cent. The English Quay is nearly 3 miles in 
length. The city is one of the most beau- 
tiful and magntficeat in the world. The im-

of the empire. It is remarkable for its**' 
works, foniiicalions, docks, arsenals, barracksi

tad other churches, and the srsenal. At the FreDch invasioo in 1813, the city was set on 
firt, and two thirds ol it destroyed. It is now mostly rebuilt. The streets are, in gefl- 
end, broad ; and some of them are paved ; others, particularly those in the suburbs, ara 
floored with trunks of trees, or boarded with planks. Wretched hovels are blended with 
large palaces ; some parts of the city have the appearance of a sequestered desert, and others 
(hat of a populous town. One of the curiosities of this place is the great bell, which is said 
10 be ^e largest in the world ; its circumference is 64 feet, and its height 19 feet. In the 
cathedral the Russian emperors are crowned. Moscow contains a university with a fine library, 
and many literary instituiions ; [lie anatomical museum here comprises 50,000 preparations It 
is the residence of the oldest and wealthiest Russian families, and the operations of its mer- 
chants extend from London and Paris to the coast of North America and the capital of 
Clijna. Population, in 1843, 375,000. 

Riga, on the Duna, near its mouth, is the capital of Livonia ; it is one of the principal for- 
tresses of ihe empire, and ranks among the principal commercial cities of Europe. Here is a 
bridge of boats over the Duna, remarkable for its length. The inhabitants are chieSy Ger- 
mans, or of German origin. Population, 72,000. Dorpat, 9,000, in the neighborhood, con- 
tains a university, with a celebrated observatory. 

Tula is one of the principal manufacturing cities of the empire ; more than 7,000 workmfo 
are employed in the manufacture of arms for the government, and philosophical instruments are 
also made here. The vast arsenal contains upward of 100,000 stand oT arms. Population, 
53,000. Kali^a, upon the Oka, has a great number of manufactories, and carries on an active 
trade. I[ Is a large, but meanly-built city, with 36,000 inhabitants. Ore/ is a flourishing diy, 
and is the great marl of Uie corn-trade for the interior of Russia. Population, 3 
pleasantly situated upon the Volga, is one of the great workshops of Russia ; t 
and silk are the chief productions of its industry. Here is a scientific school 
ry, and one of the most important theological seminaries of the empire. Pop 

Archangel^ upon the Dwina, has a &ne harbor, which, however, is closed 
year by ice. Previously to the building of St. Petersburg, it was the chief 
of Russia, and, although it has since declined, its inhabitants still prosecute i 
activity, and carry on an extensive commerce. Population, 23,000. 

TVer, with 32,000 inhabitants, situated upon the Volga, at the junction of one of the canals 
connecting that river with the Neva, is the centre of the commercial relations between Moscow 
and St. Petersburg. It is one of the handsomest (owns in Russia, conlaloing a magnificent 
imperial palace, a noble cathedral, town-house, &c., and adorned with superb quays along the 
Volga. 

SmoUiuk, 15,000 inhabitants, and J<CovogoTod-Vtliki, or Great Novogorod, 14,000, ate 
chiefiy Interesting for their historical importance. Smolensk once contained a great popula- 
tion, and Novogorod, formerly a member of the HanseaUc league, and the great mart of the 
commerce between Asia and (he north of Europe, ruled over a great part of Russia, and 
was a rich republic and populous city. " Who can stand against God and Novogorod ? " 
became a proverb. JfUhni-^ovogorod, on the Volga, with 38,000 inhabitants, is celebrated 
fiH- its great fair, the largest in Europe ; it is attended by from 120,000 to 150,000 persons, 
vbo transact business to the amount of above 20,000,000 dollars ; in its vast and beautiful ba- 
tan meet the traders of (he most distant parts of Europe and Asia. 

Kiev, pleasantly situated upon several hills on the Dnieper, is an ancient town, and was for- 
merly one of the sacred cities of Russia. It contains a splendid cathedral, an imperial palace, 
a celebrated university, and a famous monastery, in Ihe catacombs of which are preserved, in a 
dried stare, the bodies of 110 martyrs ; thousands of pilgrims visit these relics yearly, and the 
great fair of Kiev attracts annually 30,000 persons. Population, 48,000. Odtrta, one of 
the most flourishing cities of Europe, is the chief commercial mart upon the Black Sea, and 
(be outlet of the exports of Southern Russia. It is handsomely buUt, with regular and spacious 
streets, and handsome public squares and walks, aud contains many elegant buildings, public 
and pnvaie. The dry and sterile soil of the neighborhood has been converted into a fertile 
garden, by the Increase of the cliy. Population, 80,000. Chtrson, formerly the most impor- 
tant town In this section, is unhealthy, and has declined since the transfer of its commerce to 
Odessa, and the removal of its dock-yard. Population, 30,000. Odier important places in

Kazan, on the Volga, a handsomely built and strongly fortified city, is the mart of the com- 
merce between Siberia and European Kussia, and the seat of exteosive manufactures of cloihs, 
re. It was once the capital of a Tartar kingdom, and is the tDcn 
Kussia. Its university, theological academy, observatory, libnry,

3 inhabitants, is built upon one of the islands in the moulb of the 
Volga, and is the most frequented port on the Caspian Sea. Its numerous churches, tis pretty 
orchards and vineyards, ita extensive suburbs, and its Kremlin, or citadel, give it an agrceabit 
appearance at a distance, but the houses are chiefly of wood, and the streets are irregular, 
muddy, and badly paved. It is the chief Russian naval station on the Caspian Sea, and hs 
central posiuon, which affords it a ready communication with the most reoioie parts of tbe eoi- 
pire, and with the richest regions of Asia, renders it the emporium of Russian commerce vitb 
India, Bucbaria, and Persia. Three bazars or khans, in diSerent parts of the city, are appro- 
priated respectively to the Russian, Hindoo, and other Asiatic merchants. Other considerable 
towns in Eastern Kussia are Ptrtn, 10,000 inbabiUnts, important for the rich mines of cop^r 
worked in its neighborhood ; Ekaterinburg, 1 1 ,000, the centre of a rich gold district, contain- 
ing large cannon founderies, and manufactories of cutlery and other iron ware ; and UraH, 
13,000, capital city of the Cossacks of tbe Ural, with important fisheries. 

In Great Russia, besides the towns already described, are Kursk, a commercial tonn wilb 
S3,000 inhabitants, near which is a miraculous image of the Virgin, which attracts nuineiow 
pilgrims ; Vologda, 13,000, which its central position between St. Petersburg, Moscow, .Arch- 
angel, and Kazan, and the canals and navigable rivers connected with it, render the great niiit 
of tbe inland trade of Northern Russia and Siberia ; Voronege, 26,000, and Jtiazan, 19,000 
inhabitants, flourishing commercial and mauufacturiog towns ; Charkov, 13,000, noted for R) 
literarv institutions ; and PuUma, 10,000, for the victory gained there by Peter the Fiist, 
over Charles the Twelfth, of Sweden. 

15. Canals and Railroad. The system of canalisation, favored by numerous navigsblf 
rivers and lakes, and by the seas, which border Kussia on 3 sides, has been carried to a greii 
extent. It was projected by Peter the Great, who, in founding St. Petersburg, designed m 
make it the commercial emporium of his vast empire. Several canals of no great length iMt 
the waters of the Volga with Lake Ladoga, and thus connect the Baltic and the Caspian Sei' 
The Ladoga Canal, 66 miles, unites them with the Neva, and thus enables boats to avoid tbe 
dangerous navigation of the lake. Two canals unite the Northern Dwina with difierent branches 
of toe Volga, and connect the White Sea with the Caspian, The Ogintki Canal, S6 inilÂ« 
long, connects the Dnieper with the Niemen, and affords navigation from the Baltic to tbe 
Black Sea. The Canal of Peter the Fira, connects the Don with the Volga, and is 100 
miles in length ; the Oka is also united with the upper part of the Don ; these canals afford Â» 
double commuDication between the Black and Caspian seas. Another extensive system oi 
canals connects the Vistula with the Niemen and tbe Duna, and the latter with the Neti. 
There is one railroad in Russia, extending from St. Petersbui^ to Paulovski, 20 miles, wMcb 
it is proposed to continue to Moscow, 450 miles further. 

16. ^gricvUurt. Russia raises much more com than she consumes ; fruits and wiw >" 
produced in abundance ; flax and hemp are staple productions. Mulberry trees have bw 
planted to a great extent, and the raising of cattle, horses, sheep, bees, and silkworms, occu- 
pies many of the inhabitants. Poland rears many cattle, and raises much corn, hot the rich 
plains of the Vistula are blasted by Russian tyranny. 

17. Manvfattwrti, Russia hu for t loi^ lime possessed manufactures of kather, dnckt 



l^USSU. 89S 

eon]a|e, cutleiy, felt, candles, and soap. But during the last 10 ye 
made in all the branches of manufacturmg industry, and the more d 
loom and the furnace are made in great perfection. In addition to'th< 
silks, fine broadcloths, glass, porcelain paper, jewelry, and cotton. 
The governments of Moscow, Vladimir, Nishni-Novogorod, Taml 
are the chief manufacturing districts. The cotton manufacture in 
tended itself with great rapidity, owinc principally to the substitui 
workmen for slaves ; in a single village m Vladimir there are 15,60C 
laborers. 

18. Cammtrce. The inland commerce of Russia la not impeded by tolls nor staples, and it 
facilitated by navigable rivers, canals, and lakes, and by the snow in winter. Great fairs are 
held in different places. The foreign inland trade is with China, Persia, Bucharia, the Otto- 
man Empire, Austria, and Prussia. The maritime commerce is chiefly in the hands of lb* 
English, the foreign inland trade is carried on by Armenians, Jews, and Bucharians. The 
American Company has factories at Kazan, Irkutsk, Kamschatka, &c., and settlements hi 
America. The Steam Navigation Company has been formed with the design of introducing 
steam vesseb upon the Volga, the Caspian, and the Kama, and the Russian Company to extend 
the navigation upon the Baltic and Black seas, and the great rivers of the interior. The for- 
eign commerce of Rus^a has doubled within 35 years. 

19. Fukeries. The seal and sturgeon fisheries of the Ural, the Volga, and the Caspian and 
Black seas, are extensive and highly productive. Upward of 10,000 fishing-boats are em- 
ployed on the Volga, and isinglass, caviare, and oil are made. Salted and smoked mackerel 
form an important article of the commerce of the Crimea. The Cossacli^ repair to the Ural 
to prosecute the stui^eon fishery, in great numbers. Thousands appear on the ice in sledges, 
wmed with-spears, poles, and other instruments. As soon as the leader sets forward, the fish- 
ers, who have been drawn up in regular ranks, dash aiiei him ; the ice is cut, the spears cast, 
the ice covered with fish, which the fishmongers, assembled from all parts of the empire, carry 
off*, in all directions, in a frozen state. 

30. Religion. No distinction is made in favor of any religious sect in Russia. The great 
majority of (he inhabitants belong to the Greek church. In the Polish provinces the inhabi- 
tants are Catholic or United Greeks. There are many Lutherans in Finland and Esthonia. 
The Calmucs are Mahometans. The government of the Greek church is administered by the 
Holy Synod, or college of bishops and secular clergy ; under the Synod are the 4 metropoli- 
tans of Moscow, Petersburg, Kazan, and Kiev, the archbishops, &c., and 560 convents. The 
service consists chiefiy in outward forms ; preaching and catechizing being little regarded. 
The clergy are generally little more enli^tened thui those whom they aspire to instruct. 
Every bouse has a painting of a saint, or of the Virgin, before which the inmates ofier prayera, 
and perform many ceremonies. Most of the clergy are permitted to marry once. There are 
nÂ»Dy fasts, and festivals are kept with great rejoicings ; many pagan superstitions are stifl 
cherished. 

Thus doves are not eaten, as they are considered sanctified, or emblematic of what is holy. 
The marriages of the nobility are solemnized nearly as in other parts of Europe, but the court- 
ahip of the peasants is singular. The suitor applies to the mother, saying, " Produce your 
merchandise, we have money for it." Should the bargain be concluded, the bride at the 
wedding is crowned with a chaplet of wormwood, not an inapt emblem for the wife of a Rus- 
siaa boor. Hops are thrown over her bead, with the wish that she may prove as fruitful as tbe 
plant. Second marriages are tolerated ; tbe third are considered scandalous, and the fourth 
abeolutely unlawful. The dead are buried with a paper in the band, as a passport. It is ugned 
bj (be bishop or other dignitaries. 

31. Gotemment. The government is an unlimited monarchy ; all power emanates froip the 
eiBperor, who is considered to derive his authority from God. His title is Samoderjetz or At>- 
tocrat of all the Russias ; he b at once the supreme head of the state and of the church. 
There are, however, some difierencea in the administration of different parts of the empire ; 
tbua tbe kin^om of Poland, and the grand-duchy of Finland, have distinct constitutions ; tbe

Xt. ^rmv and JViuy. The army of Russia is estimated to amount to about 800,000 men, 
axcbisive of the military colonists. The military colonies are a peculiar institution of thii 
eountry ; in Uiese, tbe peasants or boors, who beloag to tba crown, are subjected to a militaij

Tbe population of Russia is composed of a great variety of different people, 

1 common, but the govenunent. The Sclavonic race comprises the greueit 

Its, including the Russians, the Cossacks, and the Poles. The latter fona tbe 

ulationof the western governments, conquered from Poland, and of tbe kaog- 

he Cossacks occupy the southern provinces on the Don and the Black Sea. 

omprbes tbe Finns, Esthonians, La^anders, and other tribes scattered ora 

le Tomea to the Ural Mountains. The Tartars or Turkiih race are spreU 

tbe Dniester to tbe Caucasas, comprising the inhabitants of the former kii^- 

Astracban, and various tribes mostly under their own govemmeni, witboi 

IS, and often preserving their nomadic habits. To the Mongol race beloq 

I southeastern governments. The Samoidu compose numerous small tribes, 

be vast wilderness on tbe northeastern coast. Beside these there is a gmi 

colonists, Saedes in Finland, Jeus, â€¢Armenians, Gypnes, &c. In the nbole 

less tbui 80 tribes, differing in language, religion, and manners, from the Ion- 

m to the highest degree of European civilization. The population of Euro- 

ided into four classes ; the nobility, citizens, free holders, crown peannO, 

and boors or serfs. The boors are tbe property of the crown or of individuals, and are \a i 

state of abject poverty and ignorance. The laws, however, afford them some protectioa sgtinsi 

,tbe caprice of their owners, and they are sometimes emancipated or permitted to porcbase 

their freedom. This servile chss comprises a third of the population, amounting to abod 

31,000,000. Those classed above as citizens are the inhabitants of cities, compoÂ»d cf 

several distinct orders, as the members of the guilds, or capitalists, with a certain bcome, ini- 

sans, notables (artists, hankers, and learned men), Slc. The noble families comprise about 

750,000 individual, enjoying certain exemptions and privileges. 

24. Dress. The nobles dress chiefly alter the English or French fashions ; but the biirgb- 
ers, roerobants, and peasants wear the national dress, of the Asiatic form. In vrinler all ck^ 
are wrapped in sheep-skins, or furs. Tbe common dress of the peasants is a hat or cap, wiib 
a high crown, a coarse robe reaching to the knee, and girded with a sash, in which the nearer 
carries bis purse and often his hatchet ; a woolen cloth wrapped round the leg instead of stock- 
ings, and sandals of pliant bark. The higher ranks wear in winter pelisses of fur, and boon 
of the same. The dress of tbe ladies 's nearly in the English fashion. The women of the 
more numerous class wear a tarapkan, or long vest without sleeves, tight around the chest, bol 
flowing over the bips, and having a close row of buttons on the facing in front. 

35. Langvage. The Russian language is a branch of the Sclavonic, rich, expressive, aod 
full of imagery. The French, however, is tbe language of courtly society ; and other Euro- 
pean languages are much used ; all which the Russians have a great facility of acquiring. 

26. banner of BvildiTig. The houses of the peasantry are similar in the greater fJrt 'i 
Russia- They are made of logs, laid one upon the other. They have but one room for 
household purposes, and this in summer and winter is always occupied with a stove, conslaniij 
kept hot. The villages have a dismal look, with the ends only of the houses to the street. 
After Petersburg, there are few Russian cities well built jand Moscow is imposing priwipilll 
fVom the great variety of oriental forms of architecture. 

27. .Food. The peasantry can seldom indulge in the luxuries of the table ; though the rick 
live sumptuously. The general food of the lower classes is black rye bread, potatoes, Â»ilie<l 
fish, garlic, mushrooms, and cucumbers, in great quantities. Tbe common drink is fww, * 
fermented liquor, made by mixing flour with water, and letting it stand till the acetous fertnentt- 
tion takes place. It tastes like vinegar and water. Mead is also a common drink, and wbiskj 
and- brandy are consumed in large quantities by tbe lower classes. Intemperance is doi cem- 

' mon with tbe nobility, hut with (he other class it is as nniversal as the means. The Cossicte 
use much brandy, and they have excellent wines, of domestic growth. The Calnwcks b>*> 
kovmias, an ardent spirit, like weak brandy, distilled from the milk of mares. Tobicco ii oÂ« 
generally used in Russia, and, when taken, it is chieflv in th<e form of snuff. Smoking, bow 
ever, is not rare, and ladies Inay sometimes be seen with a cigar.

iial in sledges. The post-hones are harnessed to clumsy carriages, in the shape <^ landaus, five 
or six abreast, widi a single horse for a leader, and sometimes another in the shafts. Tb* 
sledges are of various forms and qualities. Many are gaudily ornamented. The Kibitki is â€¢ 
rude carriage, without springs except to the seats, and in these the cxxutiers genenUy nde. It 
is shaped like a boat. The Droski is a carriage represented in the preceding cut, and tfa* ' 
passenger is scarcely two feet from the ground. In some of these carriages, he sits astrids tm 
on a saddle, and the nodon is so great in going rapidly, that a novice holds by the sash of the 
coachman, who sits before. Bledge races are common in the cities, and the geaeral pace at 
which the sledges move is very swift. They are driven nearly at full speed, whdo the passen- 
gers sit or recline, wrapped coraidetely in furs. In severe winters, many tmelere perish m 
tfie roads. In 1799, 14,000 were Erozen on the road from 8t. Petersburg to Moscow, and ie 
is common to see people who hare lost an ear or a limb, by exposure to cold. 

90. CharaeOr, Manneri, and CuHomt. The character of a people reflects the natun ^ 
tiie goTemment, for man is the creature of cb^umstuces. In Russia, property, liberty, and 
fife, are held at the wtH of the autocrat, and the nobles have nearly the same delegated power 
over their serfs. This state of government has an unbvorable influence on the character of tha 
raonarch, the noble, and the peasant, though the latter it the most degrades. The iBourcba oT 
Russia have almost always been cruel and saoguinary, the nobles sensual, capricious, and indolsBt, 
and the peasants degraded and bruta). It must be admitted, however, that tbe advance tomrda 
a better state of society has, of late years, been rapid, and the change has been nowhere so 
^pareot as in the mAiKqr. It imitt doubtless be CoramuaicaMd also to the. pea^utry. if Ibe 
state of morals at St. Petersbin^ be not unexceptionable, thet of deconini and refinenieot w^r 
eompare vrith the majwit^ of European societies. Intern pc ran oe, which used to bÂ» cherBctnr* 
â– tic of a Russian nobleman, is now the vice only of his slaves. But the Russian empire ia 
too imwieldy to receive the samtf advancement in knowledge and refinement with smaller statasi 
Id describing the Russians we must ' describe the two great classes, the nobility and tba petSM 
ants, though many traits of character run through all. All are cheerful, sodal, and IncnrinM, 
fgnd of nov^y, and quick in spprriiensioi]. 

Tbe moral aspect of the higher classes has been much changed for tbe better, but it ONist ha 
many years before the Russians can acquire the moral elevation, that distii^isbes Oormaayi 
â€¢ad England. The higher classes are animated and ibnd of amusement, but in a mat degree 
bmccesstble to the high motives of principle or honor; Tbe^ stand on the brink of barbarismy 
smI have quitted the vh-tues of thet state too lately to have acquired those of reflaemenC.

fcrtfeay have no bdier-bed. At Moscow the nobles olten .retahiidwartii, -tvbo abe ispleDdidly' 
iteaied, to stand behind their master's chair at .feasts ; arama^ht or rather an evidsiice.of tw 
hmbaiity of part ages. Giaata are ia equal : damaodi bat tbay are lessMjumerwii tisB lb* 



The ftnnians seem not to heve much lore of countty ; tiiey are willBag exiles, cyften ereii to 
Siberia, and Cbey overrun tbe south of Europe. They have not the moral sentiments, thtl 
naan to his home as the scene <^ his childhood, and of his friendships and affections ; thej 
bd by the senses and impdses, and wherever these may receive the most gratification, tbere 
die Rusfloan is the most at home. The bunung of Moscow is not now considered a sacrifice 
of patriotisiB. The governor of the city, to whom it has been attributed, supposes it to ha?e 
been committed by the wretches, who remained behind to plunder: Honesty seems to have 
fled to a more genial climate, and extortion alone flourishes. The merchants almost invariaUjf 
cheat, and ask lor their wares double what they may be induced to take, while die whole sjs- 
tern, both of police and traffic, is one of overreaching and plunder. These are ^evous charg- 
es, but they are supportec^ by the testimony of almost every traveler. No profession is booer* 
aUe bat thai of arms, and to this only the nobility devote themselves. 

The peasantry have the national facility of imitation, but as little of the inventive power a 

ptrtanis to their superiors. Though rendered in some degree stupid by their situation, matf 

of them have been found capable of imitating the best works of art. They are addicted to in- 

. tOKioation, and their monds are in a most depraved state. The lower classes of Russians art 

eqvered with filch and infested with vermin ; and the latter, it is said, have no respect for nmk, 

Ctaining both to nobles and serfs. The women are the dhidges, which they always are aiaoB; 
barians, and are as much subjected to the blows of their husbands, as these are to tbe 
eudgeb of their masters. All the operations and implements of agri6idture denote an age Â£ff 
oehind the present. What the &thers did, that do the sons ; the harrows are but the html 
' branches of the fir tree, sharpened, and dragged over the ground, and many other implements 
are equally rude. 

The bouse of a peasant is a receptacle of filth ; neatness is unknown in Russia. The door 
it closed in winter, and the air, heated by stoves and tainted by respiration, becomes excessive- 
}f offisnsivid and noxious. The Russian of the lower orders mdces his presence obvioaSto 
More senses than one. Ahnost all Russia presents a picture of the same stale of society ; for 
die dtiet of Moscow and St. Petersburg, form but inconsiderable parts of the whole. The 
Cossacks, as much as they are to be execrated in war, form apleasing exception. They fiveia 
neat villages, in a highly social and not uncultivated state. They are, to a great degree, neat 
â– I their houses, persons, and dru^b. . They have books and musical instruments. Dr. Chiipe 
^bscribes them as the most cheerful, kind, and honest of all the inhabitants of Russia. The 
kdieÂ« are handsome, and mtelligent ; many of them play on the piano forte, and have the other 
Baropean accomplishments. The Russians make good soldiers, and yet they have not a miiitaiy 
â€¢pint. But their political situation makes them passive instruments in the hands of their ndeis. 
A f^ sains his freedom, and improves his situation, by entering the army. Besides this, be is 
strong, nardy, and constitudonally brave. 

TbB Calmucksj who belong to tbe great Mongol family of Eastern Asia, roam over tbe 
Btqppes between the Don and the Volga. They settled here toward the end of the 17th ces* 
tory, but about 100 years later, in 1771, the bulk of tbe nation returned to the banks of the 
Ili, in tbe Chinese empire, only about 50,000 of their number remaining in Russia. They are 
Buddhists in religion. They have no fixed abode, but dwell In movable huts called kgbitkei^ 
iriiiefa they carry from place to place, as they follow their herds to pasture. They do not cd- 
tivale the ground, living wholly on animal food, their herds consisting chiefly of camels, sbeef, 
and horses, with ver^ few black cattle. The Calmucks are not in reality the immediate soh* 
jacts of the princes m whose territories they live, but they have their own hereditary chiefs and 
nobles, to whom they pay strict obedience. 

The Cos$ack$ are of Sclavonic origin, but seem to have been largely mixed with Tartars, 
Calmucks, and Gypsies. After a lone series of struggles with the Tartar khans, the Poles, 
and the Russians, their hetman, or chief, sought the protection of the latter in the middle of the 
17th century. The heir apparent of the Russian crown now bears the title of hetmui of the 
Cossacks. Every Cossack between the ages of ^8 and 40 b liable to perform miKtary dutf , 
and their troops are wholly composed of cavahy. They receive no pay but when in the fieM, 
or ei^i^ed in guarding tbe frontier ; but they are essentially a nation of soldiers, having their 
own local government The dress of the soldiery is a abort vest in tbe Pcdisfa style, large 
trowseri of deep blue, and a black sheepskin cap. Their arms consist of a loaa spear, sabie, 
musket, pair of pistols, and a whip with a leather thong, which they apply not to tbeir steed, baiio 
die baek of a flying enemy. Thegveat body of the Cossacks live oa the Don, aoditsbruichef; 
and theur capital has already been described ; but there are some on tbe Ural, in Sib^^ t^

SI. Bimtation. Ignorance is nowhere more profouod than in Russia ; yet much bu bees 

dooe to spread the ineans of education. Steps have been tuken, and at vast expanse, that. 

must beraafwr diffuse knowledge over the empire. Every parish, or two parisheE, united, must 

hsve a school, and, besides these, there are 503 general estabhshoients, with 1 ,505 taacbenf 

besides 51 gymnasia, one in the capital of each government. In the latter, the students aiÂ«' 

prepared for the universities, of which there are seven, viz. one at Moscow, St. Petersburg, 

KiÂ«w, Dorpat, Cbarkor, Kasan, and Helsingfors. There are several schools for the educa- 

tieo of uutructers, and upwards of 150 schools attended by students in theology. The Jews 

have a celebrated national institution, and . 

there are besides, medical, mineral, mining, ' 

marine, and other schools. 

32. ^mutementt. Many of the amuse- 
ments in Russia are those of the children in 
other countries. A large assembly will often, 
entertain themselves with forfeits and other 
similar games. In the cities, ice mountain 
form a favorite recreation. These are in-. 
' clined planes, high and steep, covered with . 
ice, down which the people descend in cars, 
or on skates, and with the Kreatest velocity. 
Swings are also used of various aorta, som* 
turning in a perpendicular, and others in a 
horizontal manner. On certain festivals, all 
At^cUl im Mmitim. tliege are pUced in the public squares, and 

die people nungle in the amusements, with much animation, and without distinction of rank. 

It may be remarked, that in despotic countries the extreme ranks are on more familiar terms . 
than under free governments. There is no jealousy between them. At some masquerades all 
persons have free admittance, who can pay a small sum for a ticket, and the laborer comes ia- 
ctmtact with the emperor. This kmd of familiarity is exemplified io the national mode of salu- 
tati<Ni, which is by kissing. Feasants kiss each other, and the rank of a princess does not 
shield her from a salute on the cheek, by the lowest boor, that presents her an egg at Easter. 
Boxing and wresthng are not uncommon, and billiards and cards are general amusements. The . 
chief game, as in Sweden, is a kiod of whist called hotton. All classes frequent the baths, 
which are numerous. Some of them are similar to those gf Finland. The bathing ig also 
nearly as promiscuous. 

33. iSlaie of thi Srlt, rSciencu, and lAttrature. No native Russian has produced great 
worics of art ; but many have successfully imitated them. The embellishments of cities and 
palacfls, are chiefly executed by foreigners. There is some taste for music ; and the national 
rostmments are the balalaika, a guitar with two strings, the giuila, a kind of harp, flutes, and 
bagpipes. The national ballads are from the 11th to the 13th centuries. Vladimer and his 
knights, are celebrated in them, as much as Charlemagne and his peers were celebrated by 
soutbem minstrels. Nestor, a monk, wrote the annals of Russia, at the close of the 10th 
ceolury. Russia has, however, little national literature ; what there is, is principally poetry 
aad history. The mathematics are favorite studies. A recent traveller relates, that he was. 
present at a party, where the cooversation of the ladies was chiefly upon the " polarity of the 
Ttya oS lighu" It is probable, that there was more afiectation than knowledge m this, though 
the female studies are not well selected. 

34. Lam. The laws are voluminous ; but the Emperor Nicholas has promulgated a digest 
â– n 16 volumes. Torture is abolished, and the common punishment is fine, the knout, and ban- 
ishnmit to Siberia. The punishment of death is nommally abolished. But torture may be 
inflartnrl without the rack, and death without the scafibld. Justice is In Russia more uncertain 
than fortune. It is a common saying, founded on sufiering, " God is high, and tbe emperor is 
far away." When the emperor is near, it Is not always as the minister of justice, or the angel 
of inercy. Tbe trial of those who have enemies in power may be long delayed, or It may oe 
atiddenly or unjustly b^d. Dr. Morton relates, that In the prison visited by him, among several 
pmooers, whose trial had been delayed, one lad waited 12 years. An order of the emperor 
IB- stronger, end more sudden in its operation, thm a sentence of court ; for the delays of testi- 
oaoDT tie avoided. The victim, who has offended tbe emperor or his informers, is taken, if in

The roads to Siberiti have of late been crowded with the b^e.^ devoted Poles, of id 
tanks, and of each sex. Victory could not allay the exasperation of tbe conqueror. At 
Varna, the capitulation of which was bought, while it was vaunted as a victory, an English sur- 
geon was taken. The particular resentment of the emperor was directed to him, on tbe plea 
that he was an engineer, thoush it would have occurred to a just prince, to be certain of tbe 
fact. The surgeon was, in spite of tbe remonstrance of the English at Odessa, sent to Siberia, 
in the depth of winter, so ill in health, and so thinly clad, that he coold hardly have survived. 

The peasants are by law subjected to the cudgel of the proprietor, and this ^' image of au- 
thority" is seldom at rest. The use of it is universal, and it is related, that when a gentlemaB 
asked his slave why he always persisted in folding a newspaper with the title inwards, his an- 
swer was, ** Please, Sir, because you never beat me." The emperors formerly held thesaDt 
instrument over the nobility, but this has given place to harder punishment ; to banishmeots, 
confiscations, and imprisonment. The knout is the peculiar punishment in Russia. It b to^ 
tore in the highest degree. To be " knouted without mercy" is to suffer the extremity of 
fanman torture, applied in the most brutal manner. The sufferer is tied to a post by the oeck, 
arms, and knees. His only covering is a pair of loose drawers. ' The executioner brandishes 
a whip, with a flat, hardened lash^ of dried hide, and every blow smites the flesh from the 
bones. In the first 10 or 12 lashes, the sufferer shrieks miserably, bat he soon becomes weak, 
and utters only faint groans, and, in a few moments, nothing is heard but the Uoody sphsh of 
the knout on the senseless body. A full hour is occupied in giving the greatest number of 
blows (upwards of 200) and the body is taken lifeless from the postÂ« But Russian justice is 
not yet satisfied ; an instrument like a comb, with iron teeth, is struck forcibly into the temple, 
and the marks rubbed with gunpowder, as a pcrpettial mark of shame, should the sufferer sur- 
vive. Then a pair of pinchers, like curling-irons, are fixed upon the nostrils, and each is cut 
or torn away for the whole length. This is so painful, that it affords a momentaiy life to tbe 
body in the last stage of exhaustion. The wretched man is then pnt into a eart, and remofed 
ioimediately to Siberia. In the execution here described, which took place at St. Petersbiffg, 
be died on the second post of his journey. 

35. MSntiquities, Russia has no antiquities, except the tumuli or barrows that extend nearly 
all over the country^ though they are the most numerous in the eastern part. They are nm- 
ihnr to the barrows in England, and the Indian graves in North America. Some that ba?e 
been opened, were found to contain human remains. 

36. Population^ Revenue^ &c. The population of the European part of Rassia, exchisiTe 
of Poland and Finland, is about 55,000,000. The revenue of the empire b 80,000,000 
dollars ; the debt, 180,000,000 dollars. 

37. Hist'ory. Russia did not acquire importance as an independent statte, till the 15th cea* 
tury. Before this period, its sovereigns were often in a state of vassriage to tbe Tartaa 
Khaas. Peter the Great laid the first permanent foundation of the Russian power, and iotro* 
duced civilization and military discipline early in the 18th century ; Catherine augmented the 
empire by the partition of Poland, and the acquisition of territory from the Turks. Tbe linh 
its of the empire were further extended at the close of the 18tb century, and Russia becane 
one of the chief military powers of Europe; She joined the coalition against revolotiooary 
France, but the victories of Napoleon for a while checked her power. The sovereignty of the 
continent was divided between France and Russia. Napoleon attempted to crush his rival, and 
the disastrous issue of the Russian campaign shook the foundation of his own empire. The 
decline of the French power brought the armies of Russia into the west of Europe, extended 
her territorial limits, and developed her military strength. Russia is, perhaps, at the pfsseol 
day, the most powerful empire of the European continent, and the weakness of her oest 
nei^bors in Europe and Asia, (Turkey and Persia,) have hiehf given her new oppertnBio^ 
for aggrandizing herself in that direction, m which the northern hordes have ever beeo IM)^ 
eager to make conquests. 



CHAPTER LVni. GEKERAL VIEW OF ASIA. 



1 . Boandarxa. Asia is bomided on the N. by the Arctic Ocean ; on the E. bj fiebnng'i 
Strait and the Pacific Ocean ; od the S. by the Chinese Sea and the Indian Ocean, and on 
the 'W. by the Red, Mediterranean, and Black seas, and Europe. It extends from lat. 1Â° to 
78Â° N. and from long. 26Â° E. to 170Â° W., having an area of 16,160,000 square miles, and a 
population of about 400 or 500 millions. 

2. Mountaint. Asia conuins the loftiest summits in the world. The Ural MnifuaitUy 
between Europe and Asia, and the Ghauli, in Hindoslan, run north and south. The Japanese 
islands are cohered with lofiy mountains, containing numerous volcanoes. The numerous 
cbaios of the Taunu traverse the country, between the Persian Gulf and the Black Sea, in 
various directions. Between the Black and Caspian seas, are llie Cattcoitan Mountaint, the 
loftiest chain of which may be considered as the division line of Europe and Asia. The 
highest summits have an elevation of 18,000 feet. 

Among the numerous groups of mountains, that cover the surface of Central Asia, there are 
four great chains or systems, which lie almost in a parallel direction, ranging nearly from west 
to east, or from southwest to northeast. These, beginning with the most northern range, ars 
Iftftfao â€¢4Kai; 2d, ibe Thian-lhof, or Tem^han ; 3d, the Kum-lun, or Kwanlvn; and 4tb, 
the HiffioZa^a mounuins. Between the Altai and the Thian-chan, are comprehended the plain 
of Zoungina, and the basin of the rirer lU, which falls into lake Balkssh ; between the Thian- 



chin and Kuen-loD, m At 
countries of Little finchni, 
or Kashgar, Zerltend, Kho* 
tan, the grest desert of Golit, 
or Cbamo, TouHas, KW 
mil, and Taogont ; id4, 
lastly, between the Kuea- 
lun and Himalajra, are East 
em and Western TUbet. 

The Altai system, pco^ 
erly so called, occupm i 
space hardly extending NT- 
en degrees in longitude, 
though in its usual accopfr 
tion, the term Altai desig- 
nates the northern botuidiijr 
of a mountainous re^ol^ 
Elretcbing from the ao\mtt 
of the Irtyche to the sea of 
Okotsk. Its highest poiiil 
lies to the northnestoflikt 
Oubsa ; to tbe east o( thii 
lake, the chain takei ibi 
name of Taognou, nhich it 
retains till it reaches hki 
Kossogol. From this place, 
it is continued, under diffe^ 
ent appellations, ull it pa 
tbe lablonnoi-Khrebet, f* 
*' Chain of Apples," vtiti 
streiclies atvay to tbe norlb- 
east, or in a direction pln^ 
lel to the sea of Okfusk. 
The mean latitude of tbe 
u- f a . chain is between 50Â° N. tsi 

^â€¢^"â– f"^ Sjogo-. lu name, i-hici 

in Chinese is said to signify " Mountof Gold," has probably been given to it on account of its greii 
metallic riches. At present, it produces, annually, 70,000 marks of silver, and 1 ,900 niarb o( 
gold. Although its summit is said hy the Chinese to reach the milky-itay, yet no psrt of ibc 
chain, probably, attains a greater elevation than 1 1 ,500 Teet. Tbe second great chain of moun- 
tains, called in Chinese Thian-chan, and in Turki Tengri-tugh, (botli appellations signifyingth* 
Celestial Mountains,) runs from west to east, nearly along the 42d parallel of north latitude. 
The culminating point of the chain is probably to be found in the mass of mountains celebntn 
under the name of Bokhda-Oola (Holy Mountain). 

Tbe third great system of parajlel mountains, is the Kuen-lun, which runs nearljr along 35Â°- 
A part of this range, under tbe meridian of 70Â° east, is called the Thsoung-Iing, or Blue 
Mountains, and forms the southern extremity of the Beloor, or Belut-Iagh, a transverse cbiin, 
which follows the direction of tbe meridian ihrough nearly ten degrees of latitude. From llÂ« 
Beloor the chain of the Kuen-lun extends in an easterly direction, towards the sources of il* 
Hoang-ho, and it penetrates even Into the Chen-si, a province of China. That part of Asa, 
however, which It traverses, is very little known, and we have as yet no observations, eitlw 
of the mean height of the chain, or of its priaclpal summits. Between tbe Kuen-lana'x' 
Thian-chan, and between tbe 90th and 100th degree of east longitude, there are two rmgo 
of mountains running in the same direction, the Nancban, or Khilian-chan, a little to the nordi 
of lake Kbouk-bounor, and tbe Tangout, which forms the northern boundary of the desen 
of Gobi. , . 

The last and best known of the four great chains, is the Himalaya. Tbe general directiot 
of tlus system is from northwest (o southeast ; it is consequently inclined at a considenbk

n^e to tba KueD-lan, vitb whteb it nnKes between Kashmir and Fysabad. FoIIowidk thu 
range, to the east we find it forming tbe oortbein bouodary of HiodDstan, and entering China. 
To the west of the Beloor, the united chains of the Himalaya and Kuen-lun fonu the range 
of the HindoO'kho, which Humboldt regards as a continiialion of tbe Kuen-lun, though it ii 
geoeralljr considered as a prolongation of [he Himalaya. After following the direction of the 
parallel through five or six degrees, this range inclines to the northwest, and, passing betweeo 
tbe plateau of Iran, and [he Caspian, is at length lost in the province of Adzerbaidjan. If, 
tberefore, we regard the Hindoo-kho as a continuation of the Himalaya, the last wiH form a 
continuous system, extending from the west of Persia to the eastern sea, or through 73 degrees 
of longitude. Some of the summits of ibis stupendous range are known to have a greater ele- 
TatioD than any other points on the surface of the earth. Djavahir, on the western side of the 
coontiy of Nepaul, Utains the altitude of S&,746 feet ; while Dhawalaghtri, on the eastern side 

of the same countryj rises to (be 
enormous height of 28,096 feet 
above the level of tiie sea. 

Between the first and second 
systems, the country is enclosed 
on the eastern side by the Khing- 
khan-oola, a range which stretch- 
es between the Altai and the 
Thian-chan, in the direction of 
north-northeast, beyond the me- 
ridian of Pekin. On the western 
side, towards Tchoui, Sarasou, 
and the lower Sihoun, it is entire- 
ly open. Exactly (he reverse of 
this is the case with the country 
between the Thian-chan snd Ku- 
en-lun, which is open on the east- 
ern side, but strikingly enclosed 
on the west by the transverse chain 
of the Bolor. This chain strikes 
off from the Kuen-lun at right 
angles, and, following the direc- 
tion of the meridian, pierces 
through the Thian-chan to the 
northwest of Kashgar, and ex- 
tends to the Alatau, another chain 
running from west to east between 
tbe lakes Balkash and Issikoul. 
The intermediate space between 
the Kuen-lun and the Himalaya, 
comprehending Thibet and Kat- 
chi, is covered with niounialns so 
closely grouped together as to 
form an almost continuous plaieau 
or table-land. Its general eleva- 
tion is great, but, as might be an- 
ticipated, very unequal. Tbe

fl92 ASIA. 

. tlMm 9AJ of Ibe odier quarters of tlie world, Africa not excepted^ jet all tbe facte tbat beir qb 
the subject concur in provine, that the notions prevalent respecting its general elevation hm 
been greatly exaggerated. A large portion of the interior of the continent, however, stiB it- 
mains unexplored by European travelers ; and even in regard to those parts virhere it is eisf of 
access, there is a great want of good barometrical observations. On the northeni side of the Abi 
range, and indeed over the whole northern extremity of Europe and Asia, the elevatioa Â«f Ai 
ground b very inconsiderable. From the plains of Brabant one may pass, from \i^ to east, 
to the steppes which border the western declivity of the Altai and Chinese Zoungaria,â€” fion 
the Scheldt to the lenbei, â€” over 80 degrees of longitude, without meeting with a single ek- 
vation exceeding 1,200 or 1,300 feet. Of late years a great number of barometrical meisse- 
ments have been made on the frontiers of Chinese Zoungdtria, the banks of the upper Irtycbe, 
and the plains bordering on lake Bzaisang, in countries situated on the southern side of the 
Altai range. The mean of these observations gives to this district, and to a great part of the 
immense steppe of Kirghiz, an elevation scarcely exceeding 1,300 or 1,600 feet above tbe 
level of the sea, and consequently not greater than that of the lake of Constance or the city 
of Munich. Of the countries lying to the south of the Kuen-lun, we have a very imperfect 
knowledge ; but the platform of Jrersia, which extends from Teheran to Shyraz, and (tod 
which the two great chams of the Kuen-lun and Himalaya proceed, is estimated by Fraser to 
have a mean elevation of about 3,500 feet. In the immense longitudinal valleys which sep* 
rate the principal mountain chains, there are extensive tracts of country which are eonsidenhly 
depressed below the general level of the plains. It is worthy of remark, that the countries 
situated between the Kuen-lun and Thian-chan have a general inclination from west to east, oc- 
casioned, apparently, by the upraising of the great transverse chain of the Bolor ; while tbe 
valley of Zoungaria, between the Thian-chan and the Altai, is inclined to the west, tbe trÂ»- 
verse ridge in this case being situated at the eastern extremity of the valley. 

From a comparison of all the observations we 'possess on the configuration and elevation of 
the Asiatic continent, it results, that the central region, between the parallels of 30^ and 50^i 
and between the meridians of the Beloor and lake Baikal, contains a vast extent of country of 
which the elevation probably does not exceed that of the plains of Bavaria, Spain, and tbe 
Mysore. There is every reason to. suppose, that plains of the same elevation as those of 
Quito and Titicaca occur only, if they occur at all, in the bifurcation formed by the junction 
of the Himalaya and Kuen-lun, in the group of mountains surrounding lake Khoukhounor, and 
b Gobi to the northwest of the Thian-chan. 

4. Depressions below the Surface of the Sea. The most singular feature in the fonn of 
the Asiatic continent, and one of the most remarkable on the surface of our globe, is tbe 
depression of a very considerable portion of the northwest of it below the level of the set. 
Between the Kouma, die Don, the Wolga, the lak, the Obtchey-syrt, Lake Aksal, and 4e 
Lower Sihoun, and along the Amoo, the whole country, including a space exceeding 875,000 
square miles, is depressed below the general level of the surface of the earth, and fonns, as it 
were, an immense oasin, the lowest part of which is occupied by the Caspian Sea and Lie 
Aral. The surface of the Caspian is 320 feet below the levd ol the Black Sea, and that of 
Lake Aral 203 feet. 

5. Volcanoes. The traces of volcanic action in Central Asia extend over a very hig^ 
portion of the interior of the continent, embracing almost the whole of Chinese Tartai7) 
and, on account of the peculiarities of their position, offer to the geologist a subject of veij 
interesting speculation. The principal seat of volcanic action in the interior of Asia is in tbe 
second range of mountains, or the Thian-chan, the whole northern declivity of which presets 
volcanic phenomena. The most remarkable volcano in this chain is the mountain called d 
Turki Echikbach, and in Chinese Pe-chan, or . White mountain, an appellation vrtiich may be 
derived either from the circumstance of its rising to the region of perpetual snow, or because 
its surface presents a whitish appearance, from its being covered with muriatic efflorescences. 
According to the reports of the Chinese, it vomits forth fire and smoke without intennission. 
On account of its central position, and great distance from the sea, this volcano is an object 
of peculiar interest to the geologist. It is situated a little to the east of Aksouj the longitude 
of which, as determined by the missionaries, is 79Â° east longitude. Its distance frcMn tbe Cas- 
pian sea is about 1 ,400 English miles. The Caspian Sea appears to be surrounded by a vol- 
canic territory. On the eastern side hot springs Durst forth at*Soussac, in tbe Karatau moup*

On the 27tfa of November, 1827, at the village of lokmali, in the tetritorjr of Bahou, aboot 3 
leagaes west from the shores of the Caspian, violent earthquakes and noises were Kcdlowed by 
an eruption of flames and stones. A space extending 1,280 feet in kn^, and 960 toctm 
breadth, burned withojt interruption during 27 hours, and was raised above tbe level of the 
neigbbormg country. After the flames were extinguished, coiomns of water were observed to 
gush forth, which continue to flow at the present time. 

6. Atoers. Although Asia is the largest division of the globe, the Asiatic streams are inferi- 
or in size to those of the American continent. The prindpal rivers descend from tne northeni, 
eastern, and southern declivities of the great central table-lands into the Arctic, Pacific, and 
Indian Oceans. Tin Fstiissey is the largest ; the Oby and the Lena are also large rivers. The

7. Seas. Asia contains several large inland bodies of water, which are improperly called 
seas. They are principally, sah. The largest of thei^ is the Caspian Sea, which receives 
sereral consideralde rivers, but has no outlet ; its bed is indeed several hundred feet lower than 
the ocean. It is 650 miles in length by 250 in breadth, and covers an area of about 245,000 
square miles. It is in many places too shallow for navigation, although in some parts very 
deep. It abounds m sturgeon, behiga, salmon, and other fish, and several species of seal are 
taken in its waters. The Sea of Okotsk^ the Sea of Japan or (htlf of Corea, the Eastom 
Sea, between the Loochoo islands and China, and the Chinese Sea to the south of Formosa, 
are large bays on the eastern coast. * The Sea of Bengal and the Arabian Sea, the Peretan 
Chdf and the Red iSfea, are the principal arms of the sea on the. south. The Red Sea is about 
1 ,400 miles in length, but nowhere more than 200 in breadth ; it has few good harBbrs, and 
the navigation is rendered difilcult by storms, shoals, and coral reefs. , 

8. Straits. The Straits of Babelmandel connect the Red Sea with the Arabian Gulf. 
Tbe Straits of Ormuz lie between the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Ormuz. The Strait of 
Malacca^ which separates Sumatra from the continent, and the Strait of Sincapore^ between 
the island of Sbcapore and Malacca, are the most frequented of Asia. Tbe Strait of Corea 
oa tbe south, and that of Sougar or Sangar on the north, connects the Sea of Japan with the 
ocean, and the Strait of Laperouse connects that sea with the Sea of Okotsk. Tbe Channel 
of Tartary flows betifireen the continent and the island of Seghalien ; and Bhering^s Strait di- 
vides tbe eastern and western hemispheres. 

9. Pemneuioe. Jlsia Minor, between the Levant and the Black Sea, Arabia^ the Deccan, 
Malacca, Corea, and Kamtschatka are the most remarkable peninsulas of Asia. 

10. Islands. On the eastern coast are the Kurile Islands; <S>e^AaIien, belongmg partly to 
China and partly to Japan ; the Japanese Archipelago ; and Formosa, the Loochoo isles, and 
Hainan belonging to China. Near the coast of Malacca are the Junkselon, *N*icobar, and 
Andaman islands. On the coast of Hindostan are Ceylon, the Laccadives, and Maldives. In 
the Mediterranean, Cyprus, and in the Archipelago, Rhodes, Samos, Mitylene, &c., belong to 
Asia. 

1 1 . Climate. The great elevation of Central Asia, and the direction and elevation of the 
mountainous chains, modify the climate of this continent, and give it a pecuUar character. In 



rapsct lo cfimate, Asm may bÂ« dirided mto 8 regions. 1 . Central Asia, Tfing between tbi 
Altaian and Himala mountatas, although situated between 28Â° and MP N. la(., experiences ttw 
rigOTS of the most northern regions, and enj^s but a short summer. 3. Soutbern Asia, cmd- 
pnaing the two Indies, sheltered bj a huge mountainous rampart from the icy windi of tk 
north, has no winter ; the suoimers are long and warm, and the seasons are distmguisbed mlo 
the wet and the dry. 3. Northern Asia, eDibracing all the extensive re^on north of the Altai, ij 
exposed to all the rigors of a polar climate. 4. Eastern Asia, exposed at once to the cooling 
induences of the interior highlands, and of the Pacific Ocean, is cold and moist. 5. Westeni 
Asia, lying between the Indus and Mediterranean and the Caspian and -Red seas, enjofs i 
milder climate and a much more serene air. 

13. Vegetablt Productiom, Asia, from its vast extent and unequal suHace, comprebcndi 
the T^etable products of all climates, from the creeping lichen, which flourishes on the borders 
of perpetual snow, to the splendid varieties of tropical vegetaDoa. 
The agricultural staples are in the warmer regions rice, of whicli 
Asia yields 37 varieties, maize, millet, and many variedes (f i 
coarser grain, called dourra, as well as other species of leguma 
unknown in Europe. In the more temperate regions, the diBe^ 
enl cereal grains are produced, and barley and oats are raised u 
far north as 60 degrees, and on tfae elevated plains of more loulb- 
ern renons. Beyond this, and in ibe higher plains, vegetUiM 
comprises only dwarf trees, berry-bearing shrubs, and ^cbens- 
The tea plant is indigenous to China, and coSee to Arabia, fit 
sugar-cane is produced in India, and the poppy plant furnishes 
great quantities of opium for exportation. The cotton sbnib, md . 
the mulberry tree grow throughout the southern regions, and various 
aromatic plants and gum-trees enrich this part of the contioent, 
yielding mace, cassia, camphor, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmegs, 
the fragrant balm of Mecca, frankincense, and myrrh. Asia also 
-. â€”^ furnishes many medicinal plants and dye-stufls. 

In thft south, the forests abound with valuable trees, fimiisbini 
various durable, ornamental, and dye woods. The 
teak tree of the Indies surpasses all others in hard- 
ness and durability. The palms yield a rich and 
nutritious juice, and all the common fruit-trees of 
Europe, many of which were borrowed from AaÂ«i 
are found in different regions. Asia Minor md 
the banks of the Euphrates abound in the myrtle, 
laurel, mastic, tamarind, cypress, and other trees- 
The oriental planes are numerous in Persia, aw 
the oak and cedar grow to a great size in the Sj 
lian mountains. In the colder regions, are ibe 
oak, ash, elm, &c., the dwarf birch, roounliin 
willow, and the dark, evergreen pines and finj 
Ctiar t^ LAaun. Further details will be found under the principal 

heads, as Hindostan, China, Silteria, &c. 
13. MmtraU. Asia yields all the useful and precious metals, but the wealth of the Asto 
mines has not been fully explored. Hindostan and Asiatic Russia produce diamonds ; |PÂ» 
and silver are found m China, Japan, the Indies, and Russia ; tin, in China and FurlhCT m*\ 
â– juicksilver in China, Japan, and Ceykm ; and lead, copper, iron, coal, and salt sbound.

Tbe Elephant (E. ^naticwi) of Asia is larger and stronger tban that of Africa. From tune 
inunemorial, the people of India have used elephants in war. They are very numerous in tbs 
warm countries of Asia, and ereo in a wild state their manners are social and inofieosive. Their 
cooimoa food is roots, herbs, leaves, vpung branches, fruit, and corn; in quest of food, they 
often ravage large tracts of territory. Tbey are taken by being decoyed into enclosures, and 
ire easily domesticated. Tbey carry burdens of 3,000 or 4,000 pounds' weight, and are used 
for almost every species of labor requiring great strength. Those of Ceylon exceed all others 
in courage and sagacity. The king of Ava bad en elephant of a cream color, which was takto 
in 1S06, and exceeded tbe age of 25 years, without showing any appearance of age.

which (he natives make their military standards, and which are used all over the East, uodei dn

in southeastern Asia ; fights between the buffalo and tiger were formerly a larorite sport of the 
id the herdsmen with great courage Irom ik 
I Dot used for draft or burden, but oiil}r for lis 
ng the Burmese. The Indian Ox [B. il- 
ia Islands, and on the eastern coast of A^u. 
h is inferior to common beef, but the bonp ii 
mon ox, and of a slaiy-gray color, 
prise some of the lai^st and smallest of dw 
extensive genus. The Ayl Ghav {AÂ»6-

magnificent of the antelopes knovn, being 
upwards of 4 feet high at the shoulder. Ii 
is a very powerful and resolute animal, ind 
frequently turns upon its pursuers ; previous 
to making its attack, it drops upon die fore 
knees, and when within a proper distinct, 
it darts forward with a fury that no mimtl 
can withstand. Even in conGnenieot il is 
found to be vicious, violent, and of a cbange- 
able temper. The Gazelle {A. nhffObt 
rom) bas been immortalized by the poets 
for ita beauty and grace. Its eyes are ui^, 
dark, and expressive of soilness ; all its 
movements are replete with grace and igi- 
lity. It is rarely more than 2 feet bigh, 
and. is less than 3 feet long. The Four- 
homed ^ntelopet, or Chicharat, are pecu- 
liar to India ; they are delicately sbapol, 
wild, and agile little creatures, about 90 
inches high. The Dorecu Antelope, die 
Goral of Nepaul, the Tftor of ihe same

It is most probable that both the CaBW 
fCameint Baetrianiu) and the Dromedary (C. dromedarivi) are of Asiatic origin. TIk 
camel, which is distinguished by two humps on the back, is confined to the wandering Ttflif 
Mibes of central Asia, but the dromedary is scattered over all southwestern Asia and nordieâ„¢ 
Africa, and is found, as a domesiio animal, in India and China. This is the animal meDtioDe<> 
in the lists ol the great herds and flocks of the earliest patriarchs, and is invaluable to the aJu- 
bitants of the countries where it is found. Three species of Horte {Eqtivi) occur in Aa" - 
and central Asia is, in all probability, the native home of the borae and the ass. These tpnmb 
are not found in southern Africa, but many of the pastoral tribes of Asia may be said (o lit'^ o" 



boreeback ; and the noblest breeds of horses are still to be met with in Arabia. Horse-flesb ia 
an importaDt article of food with some natioiis, and man's milk suppUes the place of that of the 
kine amoag some of (he tribes. The vSm (Â£. 
j9rinut) of Asia, is also of larger proportions 
and more generous spirit than those which have 
been transported to other countries. Instead of 
the dejected air, pinched dimensions, and half- 
starved appearance of the degenerate ass of Eu- 
rope, the ass of Persia and Syria approaches 
nearer to the size of a horse, and partases much 
of his beaut;^ of form, noble carnage, and great 
speed. The Ddggetat {E. hemioniu) is inter- 
mediate between the two former species, apd 
has remained in a wild state ', it inbaEiits in large 
troops the great central deserts of Asia, and is

China. The Common Pkeiuant of Eu-

found there in a wild state. The Silver

17. Religion. Asia Is the land of fable and mystery, and exhibits a deplorable examdeof 
the errors into which unassisted reason leads the religious feelings. The Mosaic and Chri^ 
tian religions, the most important truths^, have, however, been revealed on its soil ; while tbeie 
are few extravagances and absurdities that have not sprung up and flourished m the same 
region, as if to contrast in a more striking manner, human folly with divine wisdom. The ab- 
surdities of the Sabeans, the worship of fire and other elements, Mahometanism, which bai 
mixed some great truths with its errors, the polytheism of the Buddhists, the Bramins, the Lama- 
ists, the worship of heaven and of the dead, of spirits and demons, and cruel, degrading, and 
loathsome rites, and doctrines of the most absiu'd nature, have found followers and respect in 
this land of superstition. Buddhism is the religion of the greatest number of inhabitant, pro* 
vailing over all of Asia beyond the Ganges, and over a great part of Caitral Asia. Mabome* 
tanism is the most widely difiused, but its followers are not so numerous ; it is professed by the 
great body of the people of Western Asia ; Bramanism is predominant in India. Buddhism 
numbers about 170,000,000 followers ; Bramanism 60,000,000, and Mahometanism about the 
same number. Any statements as to the numbers of the different religions must partake of the 
uncertain^ of the estimated population. K the larger estimates are assumed for the popula- 
tion then we should, perhaps, state the Budhists at about 300,000,000, and the Braminists about 
100,000,000, the Mahometans at 70,000,000, or 80,000,000, and the Christians at 15,000,000. 

18. Government, Civilization. Social State. We must not attribute to the cllmtte alone 
tbe .iouiiutablllty of national character and institutions, which we observe among the Asiatics, 
whether wandering nomades or the docile subjects of great empires. Despotism, both io the 
patriarchal and the monarchical form, has long been the reigning species of government tbroi^ 
Â«iit Asia, and has exercised its full influence in taming tbe spirit and cramping the energies of 
lier children. .Superstition has also long reigned with unmitigated sway over the Eastern apd 
Southern parts of Asia ; and polygamy deprived society of some of its most endeariDg ties 
amd humanizing influence. Malte Bnm, m endeavoring to explain why great empves are more 
common in Asia than n Europe, remarks : '^ It is not enough to say, that the great plains with 
which Asia aboimds give the conquerors an easier access. This only holds good in the cen- 
tral parts ; but how many inaccessible mountains, how many large rivers, and immense deserts, 
fonil the Natural bulwarks and eternal barriers of other Asiatic nations ' When once an Asiat- 
ic nation profits by its local circumstances, it is as difficult to be conquered as any European 
poople. The Druses, the Koords, and the Mahrattas, are not the only examples ; we can 
quote one still more illustrious. The chain of Mountains of Assyria to tne northeast of Bab- 
ylon, which Alexander had no difficulty in passing, became a bulwark for the empire of the 
Parthians, before which the l^ions of Trajan himself were routed.*' 

The great conquests in Asia have arisen from another cause, and that is, the great extension 
of the same nations. The capitals of Hindostan, of China, or of Persia, being given up to 
one conqueror, the immense multitude of tribes, connected by speaking the same tongue, me- 
chaiucally submit to the same yoke. These great empires having been once established, the 
aiieceasion of one to another becomes almost perpetual, from reasons pdrely moral and religiooS' 
The nations of Asia, too numerous and too dissemmated, do not feel the ardor and energjr of 
true patriotism ; they furnish their chiefs with troops, but without zeal or energy, and thej 
cbai^ their masters without regret, or without much struggle. The Asiatic sovereigns, shut 
up in their seraglios, oppose only a vain show of resistance to the audacity of the conquerors, 
while the latter are scarcely seated on the throne, before they give wav to the same effemoicji 
which procured the downfall of their predecessors. 

The organization of the armies, which are composed chiefly of cavalry, and the want of 
Strang places, open the road to sudden and rapid invasions. Everything combines to facilitate 
the total and frequent subjugation of those vast empires of the East. But this state of tbhip 
b so little founded upon tbe physical geogpapby of Asia, that we now see India divided mto 
more than 100 soveie^^oties, â€” Persia io part dismembmdy â€” and Turkey in Asia readrto 



ifl piacas. Ancieot history mferros us, tbat all the regions of AÂ«a were originally divided 
into numerous small kingdoms, in which the will of the monarch found limits in the rignts of the 
uatioQ. Asia has seen several republics. The resistance which Tyre and Jerusdem opposed 
to the conquerors of the world, was not owing, as Montesquieu says, '^ to the heroism ol ser^ 
vitude.'^ The Persians of Cyrus were not slaves. The Scythians spoke the language of in* 
dependent men to the conqueror of Darius. 

The astonishing rapidity of political revolutions in Asia, arises, however, out of one fact 
which is really dependent on its physical geography. ^^ In that part of the world,'' says Mon- 
tesquieu, ^^ weak nations are opposed to strong ; people warlike, brave, and active, border 
upoo those who are effeminate, idle, and timid ; the one must necessarily be conquerors, and 
the others conquered. Here we have the principal reason of the liberty of Europe, and the 
slavery of Asia." It is necessary to combine this just remark with another truth, proved by 
physical geography, namely, that Asia has no temperate zone, no intermediate region between 
very cold and very hot climates. The slaves inhabit the hot, and the conquerors the elevated 
and cold regions. The latter are the Tartars, the Afghans, the Mongols, the Mantchous, and 
others, comprised under the name of Tartars by the modems, and Scythians of Asia by the 
anpients. Here we 6nd a totally different physical and moral nature ; courage animates their 
stnK^ and powerful bodies ; they have no sciences, no fine arts, no luxury ; their savage vir- 
tues are unpolished, morality is written upon their hearts ; hospitality to strangers, honor to an 
enemy, and a fidelity wholly inviolable to their own nation and friends. To counterbalance 
these good qualities, they are addicted to war, or rather pillage and a wandering life, and live 
almost in a state of anarchy. 

Such were the Scythians ; such are the Tartars. They defied the power of Darius ; they 
gave a great and subUme lesson to Alexander the Great ; they heard from a distance the victo- 
rious arms of Rome, but they did not feel their pressure. Afore than 20 times they conquered 
Asia and Eastern Europe ; they founded States in Persia, in India, in China, aiid in Russia. 
The empires of Tamerlane, and of Ghengis-khan, embraced the half of the ancient contment. 
That vast nursery of nations appears to be now exhausted ; few of the Tartars /eroain nomin- 
allj independent ; but they are still the masters of China, and rather the allies and vassals, than 
the subjects of Russia. For the present state, political institutions, and history t>f the difier- 
eot A^atic nations, we must refer our readers to the respective accounts of the different coun- 



CHAPTER LIX. ASIATIC RUSSIA. 

1 . Boundaries and ExterU. The Asiatic dominions of Russia are bounded on the north 
by the Arctic Ocean ; east by Behring's Strait, the sea of Okotsk, and the Pacific Ocean ; 
south by the Chinese empu*eÂ« Turkistan, Persia, the Caspian Sea, and Ottoman Asia ; and 
west by the Black Sea, and the Ural River and Mountains, which separate it from European 
Russia. They extend from lat. 38^ to 78^ N., and from long. 36^ E, to 171^ W., having an 
area of 5,350,000 square miles, with a population of about 4,000,000 inhabitants. 

2. Mountains. The Ural Mountains^ on the western frontier, stretch from north to south 
foe a great distance, but nowhere attain a very great elevation, the highest summits not exceed- 
ing 5,200 feet in l^ight. The JlUai Mountains stretch from east to west along the southern 
frootier, forming in part the boundary between the Russian and Chinese empires- This chain 
nirrounds the sources of the Irtish and the Yenissey, under the name of the Sayanian MounÂ«' ^ 
taios ; farther east it extends in a northeasterly direction along the western coast of the sea of 
OboCsk, under the name of the Stanavjoy Mountams, and traverses the peninsula of Kamschat 
ka^ where it presents a series of active volcanoes. The highest summits of this great mass of 
uKMiatains are from 10,000 to 12,000 feet, except some of the summits of Kimsohatka, which 
have been latdy ascertained to exceed 20,000 feet in height. Between the Caspian and Black 
seas are the Caucasian Mountains , rismg to an elevation of from 15,000 to 18,000 

feet. 

3Â» Itiurs and Lakes. The Ob or Oby rises in the Altai Mountams, becomes navigable m 
the goveniment of Tomsk^ receives the Irtish^ a large, navigable river, 1,600 miles in lengdi, 

' enters the AjFctic Ocean after a course of 2,400 miles. The Yenissey^ the largest river of 

50 



#ie eitsfem bemispbere, also rises in the Ahaian clmiii, in the Chinese empire, pMBes dkoa|^Liki 
Brikel, and, taking a northerly direelkm, flows into the Arctic OeeffiÂ» ; it is ahout 2,700 niki 
ht length. The LetM also rises in the same ny)cintains, and empties itself into the same set) 
tfiter receiying numerous large tributaries, during a course of upwards of 2,000 miles. Tk 
Kolyma, the ^adyr^ and the KamseKaika are also krge rivers* The JEtir, which receirci 
the Araxesy flows into the Caspian Sea. The Ural^ which also flows in^o the Caspian Sea, riw 
en the eastern declivitj of the mountains of the same name, and has a course of about 1,500 
miles. Of the lakes the principal is Lake Baikal^ which is the largest in Asia, being upradi 
of 400 miles long and from 15 to 50 broad ; it is of great depth, but contains numerous sboik 

4. Sieppts, The whole of the northern part of the country, from the Ural to the ocean is 
a yast steppe, or leyel desert, interspersed with extensive marshy tracts, and some prodoctive 
districts. Similar levels are found in the southwestern part, but of inferior extent* 

5. Minerab. Gold, silver, platina, diamonds, and other precious stones, with iron, leid, 
and copper are found in the Ural and Altai Mountains. Salt is found in abundance in tbÂ» 
steppes. 

6. Climate and Vegetation, The northern portion of Siberia experiences extremely tigof* 
ous winters and short summers, and the earth is perpetually frozen below the vegetable idmU 
that overlies the sur&ee. The cold is here so intense, that 72^ below zero of Fahrenheit is iMt 
very unusual, and it has been known as low as 120^ ; birds and animals, as well as nan, peridk 
keneath this dreadful temperature, their very blood being frozen in their veins. The ^ 
rivers of these dreary plains are not, like the streams of happier regions, destined to fertiliii 
the fields through which they flow, and convey their rich produce to bordering kingdosis. Bo( 
these ^^ solid floods '^ roll their sluggish mass through frozen tracts and end in a sea booad ia 
chains of perpetual loe. 

In a country like this the vegetable species are few, and theur forms are of die most sbiited 
description ; whole districts are covered with coarse rushes, dwarf birches (jBehda funui) tai 
wiMows, and arctic brambles. But as we proceed south to somewhat milder regions, the ooud* 
d^ is clothed with forests of birches {Bttula a/ia), larches, and pines, among which are i% 
Cembra pine (P. Cembra)y reaching the height of 120 feet ; the Siberian fir (P. SiMrici}, 
and the spruce (P. Mes), To these succeed maples, balsams, aspens, and poplars, but beedh 
es, oaks, limes, ash, and other hardwood trees, are wanting* Great numbers of gentians, e^ 
pecially Gentiana algida^ with hs blue and white blossoms, large patches of the yellow Rkodt^ 
dendron chrysanthemum and the purple R. dauricum^ with quantities of other pretty flowers, 
fill the meadows and open country. Lilies are abundant, and in Kamschatka their bulbs are 
used for food ; rhubarbs are also found. The cereal grains are cultivated only in the soutberD 
parts of Siberia ; wheat is raised with diflSculty in any portion, but oats, rye, barley, and 
buckwheat, supply its place. 

The government of Caucasia, and in general the southwestern parts of this extensive region, 
are exceedingly fertile, more from nature than- industry. The parts that are cultivated product 
excellent fruit of almost all the kinds known in Europe, especially grapes, which are reckoned 
the largest and finest in the world. The summers are very dry, and, from the end of Jul^ to 
the beginning of October, the air is corrupted, and the erops sometimes ruined, by iiDOoeBse 
quantities of locusts. 

7. Animals. The animri kingdom is distinguished by the same paucity of species as tbe' 
vegetable world. Yet, even in the bleak regions of the poiar shores, that beneficent Providsoca 
which presides over nature, has fiimished means of support and protection against the dthnate 

. to various animals. That severity of cold, which would otherwise be fatal to animal life, if 
guarded against in some measure by a thick coat of fat and unctuous substances ; in others h 
skins and furs, much richer, softer, and more beautiful than those which cloche die tenants Â« 
milder regions. The substances, which communicate to these classes of animals the power of 
resisting the fiercest colds of the north, become, with a little preparation, eminently useiul and 
ornamental to man ; the midnight gloom is enUvened, and the pomp of kings derives one of ^ 
most splendid decorations from commodities furnished by the ^verinf( hunter of the poiar de* 
sert. The reindeer, elk, polar bear, wolf, fox, marmot, the martin, ermine, and other sni* 
itials common to Europe or North America, have already been mentioned under those beaib. 
Varioos species of lemin^, mice, and hamsters, are more confined to Siberia* The ecotum^

imll gMit sbiD, tbe principal chamber sometimes having abone 20 dtffinrent entitnnices ; ad^oiip 
lag dns are several other rooms, in which it deposits its winter stores, as in granaries ; mestf 
scores it will not touch until compelled hj the approach of the cold season, when, with its mate, 
it retires to its weBÂ«^tored dwellings, and enjoys the fruits of its industry. Numerous species of 
seal, as the Chreenhnd seal {Phoca ChrBnlandiea)^ the $ta*bear (Otaria ttrnna), and sea-KoH 
(O. jnbata)j throng the Arctic Sea ; the Baikal seal (P. BotMonica) is found in the lake ot 
thict name. An immense species of elephant^ now extmct, formerly belonged to Siberia, and 
enormous tusks are found, sometimes weighing 600 pounds. The remains of these huge crea* 
tores are so abundant, that ivory forms an important article of export. 

The animals of the Caucasian regions are, tbe caracal lynx^ chamois and ibex goats^ bearsj 
antelopesy a tiger of an unknown species, the bison, long extinct in Europe, the vdld sheep 
{Oris Ammon), &c. 

8. Divisions. The countiy between the Caspian and Black seas, called by geographers 
tho Caucasian region, is politically divided into 12 provinces, and several districts whicn are 
only nominalh^ dependent upon the Russian government. The vast region to the east of the 
Ural Mountains is known geographically under the name* of Siberia, but is poUtically divided 
into tbe four governments of Tobolsk, x enisseisk, Tomsk, and Irkoutsk, the two provinces of 
OnMc and Yakontsk, the two districts of Okotsk, and Kamschatka, the land of the Kir^sels, 
and the land of the Tchuktchi. 

Â§. 7Wfw. Tiflis, the capital of Georgia, is a handsome town with spacious streets and 
sqtiares, large barracks and caravamseries, and some elegajt public buildings. It has 30,000 
rtihabitants. Briwin is the capital of Armenia, a Persian province lately conquered by Russia. 
It safiered much during the war, but has 13,000 inhabitants, and is tbe residence of the ArffleÂ«Â» 
niaa patriarch. Chamakiy the capital of Shirvan, and formerly a great commercial empc 
mm of this part of Asia, has about 15,000 inhabitants. 

T6bolsk, on the Irtish, is,' like the otber towns of Siberia, built chiefly of wood, and b liaÂ« 
Me to be inundated by the river. The streets are covered with thick planks. The population 
IS about 25,000, engaged in carrying on an extensive trade, and manuractures of leather, soap^ 
and surgical mstruments. In the spring the Russian traders arrive here on their way to tn6 
remote regions of Siberia, and in the autumn return hither to wait till the weather enables Aem 
tÂ«y transport their goods on sledges into Europe. Caravans of Calmucks and Bucharians also 
^>end the winter here. Irkoutsk is the ebiet place of Eastern Siberia, and is a large town 
with S5,000 inhabitants. Its manufactures, its learned institutions, and it3 active commerce 
give it a European appearance. 

MRaktay upon the Kussian frontier, is a place of much trade and great wealth. Yakoutsk, with 
3,000 inhabitants, carries on the fur trade to a great extent, and has several important fairs. Tomsh^ 
capital of the government of the same name, is situated upon the great route to China, and 
has an active trade, with some manufactures. Population, 10,000. Kolyvan, a small town 
in the same government, Is the centre of a rich silver mine district. Okotsk, capital of the 
<fistrict of the same name, and Petropvlosk, capital of Kamschatka, are small towns with about 
1 ,000 inhabitants. 

10. Industry. The whole country is thinly peopled, and in many parts inhabited only by 
|ude tribes of hunters or fishermen, or occupied by wandering shepherds. The manufac* 
tnres are few and inconsiderable, and agriculture is little attended to, but the trade with China, 
Torkistan, Persia, Turkey, and European Russia, is active and important. 

1 1 . Islands. The sea which separates the southern point of the peninsula of Kamschatka 
ftott Japan, contains a number of islands, in a position from northeast to southwest, which ara 
called the Kurile Islands* They are upwards of 30 in number, are all mountainous, and in 
several of them are volcanoes and hot springs. The principal of these islands are inhabited ; 
but the small ones are unpeopled. They differ much from each other, in respect both to their 
situation and natural constitution. The forests "x the northern isles are almost entirely com* 
posed of pines ; those in the southern, produce canes, bamboos, vines, Adc. In some oif them 
are bears and foxes. 8ea*otters appear on the coasts of all these ishnds, as wqll as whales, 
sea-horses, seals, and other amphibious animals. Some of the inhabitams of these islands have 
a great likeness to the Japanese, in their manners, languaee, and personal appearance ; othan 
very much resemble the Kamschadales. The northern islands acknowledge the sovereignty of

much huauDity and prolttty in their conduct, and are courteoua and hospitable. Tbejufl 
chiefly employed in hunting, takiog sea-animals and wbaJes, and catching fowl. 

Between tlie easlern coast of Kamschatka and the western coast of America, are vaikMi 
groups of islands, divided into four priacipai groups, the first two of which are called the tSlair 
ban Islands. The first group, which b called by some of the Islanders Sasiguam, comprebends, 
1. Behrlng's Islands, which b 90 miles in length, and 25 in breadth; 2. Copper Islaad ; 
3. Ocma ; 4. Samyra, or Sbemyia ; 5. Aoakta. The second group is called Kliao, and 
comprises Immak and 7 other islands. The third general name is Jfegho, and conaprebeodi 
the islands known to the Russians under the name of Andreaaoffski Ostrova, 16 of which are 
mentioned by geographers. The fourth group is called Kaoalangy aod also includes 16 isUods, 
which are denomiaated Lyssic Ostrova, or the Fox Islands. 

Some of these islands are only inhabited occasionally, and for several months in the jear, and 
Others are very thinly peopled ; hut some hare a great number of inhabitants, who const||^y 
reside in them. Copper Island received tls name from the copper which the sea throws.^Mo 
its coasts. The inhabitants of these Islands are In general of a short stature, with stout, rcfijB 
limbs, hut free and supple. They have lank, bkck hair, and little heard, flattish faces, and-'wr 
skins. They are for Uie most part well-made, and of strong constitutions, suited lo the boister- 
ous climate of their isles. The Fox Islands are so called from the great number of black, fftf, 
and red foxes with which they abound. The dress of a native consists of a cap, and a fur coal 
which reaches down to the knees. Some of them wear common caps of a parti-colored bird- 
akin, upon which they leave part of the wings and tail. On the fore part of their bunting and 
fishing caps, they place a small board like a screen, adorned with the jaw-bones of sea-bears, 
and omamenled with glass beads, which they receive in barter from the Russians. 

13. Inhabitants. This vast country contains more than 100 tribes, differing in Daannen, 
language, and religion. The Russians, Cossacks, and other settlers from Europe are chiefly 
in the towns and military stations. There are many Tartars, and colonies of them north of the 
Caspian and the Caucasus. The Calmucks are perhaps the most peculiar race in the empire. 
They are of a d^k color and athletic form. They have high cheek bones, small eyes, distant 
from each other, and enormous ears. There are some tribes of Monguls ^d Man^urs, or 
Mantcboos. The latter are a branch of the Tungooaes, occupying the central parts of Sibeiia, 
about a third of the whole. In the northern regions, there are Finns and Samoleds ; the la.Ua 
are short in stature, seldom exceeding 5 feet, and often but 4. They have short legs, laige, 
flat heads, wide mouths, large ears, small, angularly-placed eyes, and black and bristly hair. 
Their complexion is an olive. The Yakouts are a large tribe on the river Lena. The Geor- 
gians and Circassians are a well-formed race of men, and the females are renowned for beauty. 
They have fair complexions, regular features, and commaading 
forms. The Circassians have slender waists, and these in the 
men are rendered more so by a light sword-belt, which ibey cod- 
stantly wear. Besides these tribes or people, which are a small 
part of the wbole, there are many foreigners, as Germans, Pot^, 
Swedes, Armenians, together with a few Hindoos, Gypsies, and 
Jews. 

The form of dress is nearly as various as the people. In the 
nortbero countries, it consists for a great part of the year ia fiirs*, 
while the Calmucks have scarcely any clothing but a strip cf cloth 
about the waist. The dress of the Tartars Is chie% a striped 
silk and cotton shirt, a short tunic, and over this a caftan or east- 
ern robe, girded with a sash. Short boots and loose drawers are 
worn. In summer, the head is covered with a turban ; in winter, 
with a helmet of wood. All Tartars shave their beards. The 
languages are various, and thai of Georgia is radically different from all others. The dwellings 
are of almost every form, though there is little good architecture. In Siberian towns, the Bus- 
stan mode of building ia somewhat followed. The Tartars have neat cottages, whitewashed, 
â– nd with gardens attached. The Tungooses dwell in tents. The Kamschadales live io vil- 
kwes, built like those of Russia. Many Georgians dwell in huts half sunk in the earth, and the 
Circassians in cottages of wood and plaited osiers. The food is different in various parts. Id 
fiiberia, Gsb foims a great article of food. The Tartars eat the flesh of horses, or whatever

The courtship of the Calmucks is a horse race. The bdy whose good will is solicited, is 
mooDted oa horseback, and the wooer follows. If he is TaTored, he is permitted to overtake : 

if Dot, whip aod spur are 
Vain, for the lady is too 
good an equestrian, and 
has too much at stake, to 
be overtaken. Among 
the Crim Tartars, court- 
ship and marriage are 
cumbered with ceremo- 
Dies. The parties seldom 
see each other till the 
ceremony, and the con- 
tract is made with the 
heads of the tribe. At 
the period of the wed- 
' ding, the villages near are 

feasted for several days. 
Much ceremony is used 
in preparing the bride, 
who is bound to show 
every symptom of reluc- 
tance. There is a con- 
test between the matrons 
and girls for her posses- 
Tkrtar WiddJng. sioa. The priest asks tha 

bride if she consents, and 
on the affirmative, blesses the couple in the name of the prophet, and retires. There is a 
great ceremony and cavalcade, when the bride is carried to her future home. She is carried 
in a close carriage, under the care of her brothers, while the bridegroom takes a humble sta- 
tion in the procession, dressed in his worst apparel, and badly mounted. A fine horse, bow- 
ever, is led for him by a friend, who receives from the mother of the bride a present of value, 
as a shawl. There are not many facilities for intveling In any part of Asia. In the Russian 
possessions, however, posts are generally established ; and in Kamschatka, they are supplied, 
instead of horses, with dogs. In Siberia, there are few inns, and the traveler finds money to 
be an incumbrance. The generous hospitality of the people not only supplies his wants la 
food and clothing, but he is feasted is though he were a long absent relaUon. The diseases 
most general or fatal are scurvy, smallpox, fevers, and the most of the common maladies of 
other countries.

13. Character^ -Mwt^ers^ &c. Among a people Â«o Tarions as the mhahitmila of 
Russia, there must be great diversity, and opposition of manners and customs. Id aop^ af 
the towns of Sioeria there is considerable intelligence. There is in all great hospaaIil|f and 
much social intercourse, and the provinoes are better residences than Central Russia. It ii 
remarked, that no government banishes fools ; and it may be added, that many of the exitei 
in Siberia, are banished only for their virtues. The effect of these is seen in the state of so- 
ciety. The gayety of the Siberians is somewhat rude ; but their hospitality is deserving aO 
commendation. The Tungooses occupy nearly a third of Siberia. They are hospitable, hn- 
provident, honest, and faithful to their word. They bear privation with wonderful eodorance, 
and when tl^ey are forced to kill a reindeer for want of food, (hey refrain till they have lasted 
a week or more. They are filthy in the extreme. They smoke and drink spirits wfaeoever 
they can obtain tliem. The Yakouts are quick and observing. Many of the Tartars and Cal> 
mucks are nomades. The appearance of the latter is athletic but revolting. They are cheer- 
ful and much given to equestrian exercises, and the women ride better than the inen. The 
Samoieds live without rulers, and have no words to express virtue or vice. It is not probable, 
however, that they are without either quality. The Kamschadales are in a great degree inde- 
pendent, honest, and veracious. The Georgians and Circassians are a rude people, addicted 
to violence. The latter live in a feudal state, in which the princes are paramount, the nofaies 
next in authority, and the main body of the people serfs. The princes give their children to 
the nobles to be educated, and seldom see them till they are of age. The Circassians cany 
the principle of revenge to an unlimited extent. Blood ior blood is so far die practice, that the 
mnocent are involved with the guilty, and the duty of redressmg an injury is hereditary. The 
amusements of all these different nations are various. Almost all of them, however, have the 
game of chess, and all practise dancing. Of the religions, perhaps Mohammedan is the most 
general, and after that Christianity, Lamaism, and Btkidhism. Paganism is, howey^, as ex- 
tensive as any of these. The Yakouts have a corrupted Shamanism ; and they worship prio- 
cipally the sun and fire. The form of Christianity is that of the Greek, or of the Armeniao 
church. 

14. History. Siberia can hardly be said to have a history of its own, but the few notices 
which relate to it, record the conquests or dbcoveries of its foreign masters. Toward tkr 
close of the 1 6th century, a band of Cossacks fled into these then unknown regions from the 
arms of Russia, and reduced some of the native people, but, being obliged to submit to tfae sa* 
premacy of Russia, his conquests only served to enlarge the domains of that power. In abom 
50 years the Russians pushed across the continent to the Pacific Ocean, which thfy reached ia 
1639, and having afterward explored those seas, sailed up between Asia and America into the 
Arctic Ocean. Their conquests on the Caucasus are of later date. Georgia, formerly a pow* 
erful kingdom, had been reduced by Persia to a state of dependence, but, having revolted wai 
sought the protection of Russia, the latter took advantage of this circumstance to remove Ae 
hereditary princes from the throne, and to reduce the country to a Russian province. In 1828^ 
Persia was obliged to cede Erivan and Nakshivan to Russia, which has also recently wrested 
several districts from the Ottomans. The Caucasian tribes still make a vigorous resistance ; tod 
the authority of the Russians is limited to the country occupied by their armies.

CHAPTER LX. TURKISTAN, OR INDEPENDENT TARTARY. 

1. Boundaries. This extensive region, which is about 900 miles from north to sotith, aod 
700 from east to west, is bounded north by the Russian empire; east by the Chinese empire; 
south by Cabul and Persia, and west by the Caspian Sea. It lies beiwen latitude 36* aod 
51** north, and longitude 50** and 7T east. 

2. Deserts. The northern tpart of the country is an immense desert, extending into Russia; 
the western part, lying betweeu the Oxus and the Caspian, is also a desert, called the desert of 
Karasm. The district in the southeast, extending from the Belur Tag Mountains to the sea of 
Aral, and watered by the Oxus, the Sihon, and their numerous tributaries, was well known to 
the ancients for its delightful climate, its fertile soil, and dense population. The Arabian ^eo^ 
raphers describe it as the paradise of Asia, and ware never weary of expatiating in its praise, h 
was represented as filled with splendid cities, and the populousness, was said to be such that ap 
army of 900^000 horse, and the same number of foot could be drawn from k withcart tfae coMBiqr 

'** ' by thehr absence. This tract is now called Great Bukharia.

The Qrtft, Giho% or â€¢Amou, the largest river of the country, risea in the BÂ«loor Mouotaio^i 
iad flows through Â« fertile tract into the Aral Sea. The JaxaritSy Str^ or Sihon^ rises in tba 
mountains of the Chinese empire, and empties itself into the same sea. The Outran, wfaidi 
traverses Bucharia^ and the kara9u^ which runs through the land of the Iiirghises, afeo eiiq)^ 
their waters into lakes. There is a great number of lakes, among which the ^ralj usuaUj 
termed a sea, is the principal. It is, after the Caspian Sea, the largest inland body of water 
in Asia, being about 250 miles in length, and covering an area of about 10,000 square mileiu 
Jxs waters are salt, and its shores low and sandy or marshy. It is inhabited by nmnerous fish 
and seals. 

4. Divisions. This region is occupied by a great number of Turkish tribes, forming many 
independent States ; its great geographical divisions are the land of the Kirghises in the north : 
Turcomania or the country of Turkmans, in the southwest ; Turkistan Proper, or the land oi 
the Turcomans in the east, and Usbekistan or the land of the Usheks, in the south ; but these 
umd other tribes are scattered about in various parts of the country. The chief States are the 
knanats of Bucharia, Khiva^ and Khokand, after which rank those of Hissar, Balk, &c. 

5. Bucharia. This country comprises the richest and most populous region of Turkistan, 
and has an area of 80,000 square mnes, with 2,500,000 mhabitants. The ruling people are 
the Usheks, a Turkish tribe, but the natives or Bucliarians, are of Persian origin, and are 
found all over Asia, from Russia and Turkey t9 China, in the capacity of traders. 

Bucharaj the capital, stands m a pleasant plain, but it is meanly built, with crooked, narrow^ 
and dirty streets, upon which the houses present only a blind wall, their windows being upon 
interior courts. The population is about 80,000, of which three quarters are Persians, and 
the remainder Usheks, Afghans, Jews, Arabs, &c. The ark or palace of the khan, the 
360 mosques, and 60 madrasses or colleges, the vast caravansenr, &c., are the principal puh- 
Gc edifices ; its manufactures and commerce attract merchants (rem all parts of Asia, and its 
seminaries, which render it one of the chief se^ts of Mahometan learning, are estimated to be 
attended by 10,000 scholars. Samarcandy once the capital of the great empire of Tamerlanet 
although declined from its ancient splendor, still contains 50,000 inhabitants, numerous maiu>- 
finctones of silk, cotton, silk paper, and many learned institutions or madrasses. Here is also 
the tomb of Tamerlane, built of jasper. \N*akshtb is a large town with 40,000 inhabitants. 

The Bucharians are disdnguished for their industry, commercial enterprise, and frugality. 
They traverse all parts of tne continent in their trading expeditions^ and have even formed nu* 
merous colonies in China, Russia, and other parts of Turkistan. Their trade with Russia by 
Orenburg, with China by Casbgar, Cabul, and Balkh, and with India by Cashmere, constitutes 
the most important part of their commercial operations. They also excel in the manuiacUnce 
of cotton, sdk, caps, paper, &c. The Usheks, who have conquered this and the neighbor* 
iDg regions, are a rude and warlike people, who consider war and robbery as the only hononn 
ble occupations. They hold the public offices, are the soldiers, &c., and often invade the 
Persian and Russian territories, carrying off slaves and plunder. 

6. Khiva. The khanat of Khiva is the most extensive State of Turkistan, but much of its 
territory consists of deserts. It* has an area of 150,000 square miles, with only 800,000 inÂ« 
habitants. The dominant people are the Usbeks, who bave extended their conquests over the 
Karakalpaks on the Sir, the Aralians on the Amou, and a part of Turcomania. Khiva^ the 
capital, in a fertile territory near the Amou, has about 15,000 inhabitants ; it is the greatest 
slave market in Turkistan. This country was early converted to Mahometanism, and in the 
dih century formed the kingdom of Kharism, the dominion of which was widely extended over 
Central Asia, until it was subverted by Zingis Khan. Urgunge, the ancient capital, is now 
mostly in ruins. 

7. Khokand. The khanat of Khokand b mferior to that of Khiva in extent of territory 
but is more densely peopled ; its area amounts to 75,000 square miles, with a population of 
1 ,000,000 souls. It comprises the country lying upon the upper part of the Sir. Its capital, 
Xhokanj upon a tributary of the Sir, is a place of much trade, and cor tains 3 stone bazars, 
â– everal mosques, the castle of the Khan, &c., with 60,000 inhabitants. 

6. Kingdom of Balkh. Balkhj the capital of an independent khanat, is an old city, formerly one 
of the most wealthy and populous of Asia, but now much reduced, having but 10,000 inhabit* 
otttB. As the residence of the kings of Bactria, it was the rival of Nineveh and Babylon, the 
ecntre of the conunerce between the east and the westi and one of the chief seats of eastem 



Â«Hi 



TURHSTAN, OR INDEPENDENT TAETART, 



learning. Under the name of Bactria, this countiy has, from remote antiquity, been celebntfld 
in the annals of the east. Under the auspices of Alexander, a GSreek kingdom of Bactm was 
formed, which continued for several centuries, and even after its fall retained marked traces of 
civilizatidn. Undei; the Roman empire, when a commercial route had been opened across 
Asia as far as China, Bactria was die great rendezvous of the caravans, before entering the 
Meak r^ons of Tartarj. When Asia yielded to the dreadful sway o^ the Mongol winfiors, 
Bactria lay in their route across the continent, and suffered accumulated disasters. The dtj 
of Balkh IS commonly called in the east, the mother of cities. 

* There are several other khanats of considerable extent ; the land of the Kirghises, compris- 
ing the central and northern parts of Tartary, is inhabited by numerous small tribes of timt peo- 
ple under distinct and independent chiefs ; and Turcomaniaj between the Caspian and AnI 
seas, and the khanat of Khiva, is occupied by similar tribes of Turkmans. 

The Kirghises, retiring before the Russians, moved their flocks and tents from the pastonl 
regions of Siberia to the steppes and wilds north of the Jaxartes and Aral, and east of the 
Caspian. They are divided mto 3 branches of hordes, called the Great, Middle, and Link 
Horde. The Great Horde ranges to the south and east, and many of its tribes have adopted 
the habits of those more improved districts, and acquired a fixed and peaceable character. The 
Middle and Lessor Hordes occupy the shores of the Aral, and the tract extending firom it 
Aral to the Caspian, and in these the orinnal nomadic character is preserved almost eotin; 
they own in some degree the supremacy of Kussia, which, however, has to resort to means cf 
conciliation and defence to keep them quiet, making annual gifts to the chiefs, and maintaiinDg 
a line of strong posts from the Ural to the Irtish. Still these wild tribes make occasional forays 
into the. more settled districts, and plunder or exact a ransom from the great caravans, which 
cross their territory. The wealth oi the Kirghises consists in horses, goats, the large-tailed 
sheep, and a few camels. Their tents of felt are larger and neater than those of the Calmucb. 

9. Koondooz. Between Cabul and Bucharia, to the south of the Oxus, is the little State 
of Koondooz, ruled by a Meer or Usbek chief, who has established his power over all the 
neighboring districts, and is master of all the upper Oxus and its tributaries. He has reduced 
Badakshan, and has even sacked the city of Balkh. The town of Koondooz stands in a marshy 
and unhealthy valley, and is only visited by the M eer in winter ; it was once a large town, but 
is now ahnost deserted. The long valley of Badakshan, through which the Oxus flows, is 
celebrated all over the east for its mineral wealth, including iron, salt, sulphur, lapis lazuli, aod 
rubies. Fyzabad is the capital of Badakshan. The mountainous tract of Shoghnan, to the 
west, once gave the name ot Sogdiana to all this region. 

10. Inhabitants, The name of Tartar has been incorrectly applied to many of the nomade 
tribes of northern and middle Asia. Turks is the name by which they prefer to be called, 
and many of the tribes are not Tartars. The most conmion dress among the Turkish Tartars 
is a calico robe and drawers. Red is the favorite color. Some of the dresses are trimmed 

. with wool. Garments of skins also are sometimes worn.* In a country inhabited by wan- 
dering tribes, there are few cities, and costly habitations. Many of the tribes dwell io tents, 
and the richer individuals in wooden houses so small, that they may be removed in wagons^ 
The Turcomans sometimes have only the shelter of caves. The food is principally drawn 
from the herds, and from hunting. A little millet is sparingly used. Horse flesh and mutton 
are preferred to beef and veal. There is much milk, butter, cheese, and koumiss. The man- 
ners and customs are those of a people warlike and fierce. The Tartars have neither reguhr 
employment, nor settled habitations. They remove with their flocks and herds fi*om place to 
place. When a Tartar would curse with emphasis, he imprecafts upon his enemy a settled 
abode, and a life of labor, like a Russian. The predatory habits of many of the tribes of thb 
region render traveling very hazardous among them. Caravans are often attacked and plun- 
dered on their route by the Turco- Tartar hordes, and the only security in passing through thb 
country is to travel in large numbers and well armed. The Turco-Tartars are distingiusbed

till the cutting out was finished; the man then, whoba4

ral pieces were stitched together, so that in less tbaa J 
hours he had a good brown-bay coat, which only waika

11. HUtory. The Scythians of the ancient world, and the Tartars of modern times, have 
maintained in all ages an unchanged character. In war, they hare always been formidable ; 
tbeir furious inroads, their rapid 6ight, and their terrible ravages, have always made them an 
object of terror or anxiety to the bordering countries. The Saracens reduced some of ih^ 
coentries on the Oxus to their sway, in the 8th century, but the Turkish tribes soon after ex- 
pelled the invaders, overrun Persia, and conquered Asia Minor, where the Seljukiao Turlu 
continued to rule for several centuries. In the 13ib century, Turklstan was included In tbe 
vast empire founded by the great Mongol conqueror Zingis or Genghis Kahn ; but in tbe next 
century, Timur, or Tamerlane, not only threw off the Mongol yoke, but carried the arms of 
tbe Turco-Tartars over Persia, established a dynasty, commonly but erroneously called the 
Mogul, which ruled over India, and crushed for a lime the rising power of the Seljukian Turks 
in ^e west. The ruling race of Persia is of Turkish origin. In more modern times, the 
proper country of the Turks has been partly reduced to ajiominal dependence on Russia, is 
partly included within the Chinese empire, and is partly independent ; hut, as above described, 
split up into numerous petty States. 



CHAPTER LXI. OTTOMAN ASIA, OR TURKEY IN ASIA. 

1. Boundariei and Extent. Asiatic .Turkey is bounded N. by the Black Sea and Russia; 
E- by Russia and Persia ; S. by the desert of Arabia, and the Mediterranean ; and W. by 
the Archipelago. It extends from 30Â° to 42Â° N. lat., and from 26Â° to 49Â° E. long., com- 
prising about 400,000 square miles, with 8,000,000 inhabitants. 

3. Mountains. Asia Minor and Armenia are mountainous countries. In Armenia is Mount 
Ararat, 17,300 feet above the sea, and believed by the inhabitants to be the eminence 
on which Noah's Ark rested. The chain of Movnt Taurtu extends westerly from Arme- 
nia, and intersects by numerous branches the greatest part of Asia Minor. Its highest 
summits have an elevation of from 13,000 to 15,000 feet. 

3. Rwers and Laka. The lai^est river of this country is the Euphrateg. It rises in 
two broad streams in the mountains of Armenia, and breaking through the chain of 
Mount Taurus, flows southeasterly into the Persian Gulf, af^er a course of 1,300 miles 
The Tigru is a branch of the Euphrates, rising in the same quarter, and flowing mostly 
m a parallel direction, till it joins the Euphrates, after 8 coune of 600 miles. The Kitil Irmak,

â€¢nd refined community. At a later period, the Knights of St. John, when expelled froin rbt

'Holy Lind by the Turks, took shelter in Rhodes, and loDg baffled the im 
Solyman by their brilliant coutage. But the Turkish sway has long since 
^ories, and Rhodes is now poor and thinly peopled. 

Cyprus, the largest of the islands, lias the furthest south ; it is 140 mil 
breadth. It is traversed by two lofty mountainous ridges ; and the whole fa( 
verdaotas to resemble an unmense flower-garden. It produces rines, olive 
Rpricots, and numerous other fruits. Com and silk are raised, and carpets n 
popula^on is about 80,000. 

5." Climate. In the mountainous parts, especially in Armenia, the climate is temperate and 
healthy. In Mesopotamia, it is hot and unhealthy. The Simoom, a poisonous wind of the de 
sert, is common here. This countiy contains the most fentle provinces of Asia, and produces all 
the luxuries of life in abundance. Raw silk, com, wine, oil, honey, fruit of every species, coffee, 
myrrb, frankincense, and odoriferous plants and drugs, flourish here, almost without culture, which 
is practised chiefly by the Greeks and Armenians. The olives, citrons, lemons, oranges, %s, and 
dates produced in these provinces, are highly delicious, and in great plenty. As it was hence, that 
arts and civilization were carried to other regions, so are we indebted to this and the neighborii^ 
countries forborne of our most valuable fruits. The walnut and peach are from the tracts bordering 
on Persia ; the vine and apricot, from Armenia ; the cherry and sweet chestnut, with the fig, the 
olive, and mulberry, from Lesser Asia ; the melon and cucumber are also indigenous to this soil ; 
and several of our most ornamental trees and garden plants, the horse-chesmut, lilac, sweet jasmine, 
damask rose, hyacinth, tulip, several kinds of iris, ranunculus have been borrowed from these 
favored regions. In the south, there are extensive deserts, where no tree casts a welcome 
sbade ; but the hills and valleys of Asia Minor, are crowned with forests of pine, fir, larch, 
cedar, beech, vaiious species of oaks, the almood, lentisks, pistachio trees, terebindi, &e.

8. DiviHofu. Asiatic Turkey is politically divided into 16 eyatets or pachalics, which are 
subdivided into sangiacats. But many of the mountaineers and nomadic uibes are only uibif 
taries ; others are merely vassals, that is, they recognise tbe superiority of the Porte ; and some 
are entirely independent. It is not rare for the pachas also to refuse obedience to the orders 
of the sultan, and to reÂ»st his forces. The common geographical divisions, generally used by 
writers, are Asia Minor or Anatolia, Geoi^ia, Armenia, Curdisian, and Mesopotamia or Alje- 
sira, with Irak-Arabi. Only a part of Georgia, Armenia, and Curdistan, belong to the Otto- 
man empire. 

9. Tomtg. Bagdad^ built upon both banks of the river Tigris, was for some centuries tbs 
brilliant metropolis of tbe caliphate under the Saracens. This city retains few marks of its an- 
eieat grandeur. It is in tbe form of an irregular square, ill-built, and rudely fortified ; but the 
convenience of its situation renders it one of tbe seats of tbe Turkish government, and it has still 
a considerable trade, being annually vbited by tbe caravans fk>m Smyrna and Aleppo, and sup-

plied also with the produce of Persia and India. Most of tbe houses have a court-yard, in the 
middle of which is a plantation of orange trees. The bazars are handsome and spacious, and 
filled with shops for all kinds of merchandise. These were erected by ihe Persians, when 
they were in possession of the place, as were also the bagnios. The castle, which is of stone, 
commands the river. Below the castle, by the water side, is the palace of the Turkish govent- 
at ; and (here are many gummer-houses on tbe river, which make a fine appearance. Fopo- 
lition, 100,000. 

Baitora or fitura, which is simated below the junction of the Tigris and the Euphntes, b 
considered as the second city of the pachalic of Bagdad ; but it has greatly declined from hs 
former wealth and importance, though it still has a popuUtion of â‚¬0,000, who cany oa an a 
tensive trade. Tbe bouses are meanly built ; the bazars are miserable structures ; and of 40 
mosques only I is worthy of the name. The Arabs form the most numerou-i class t^ tbe in 
habitants ; but the Armenians are the chief managers of the foreign trade. For the merchu- 
diae of British India, they chiefly exchange bullion^ pearb, copper, silk, dates, and gall-nuts â–

iÂ§ situated on a plain near the Tigris, was once a flourishing town ; but il is now deoUDing, 
though It still has about 60,000 inhabitants ; among whom, besides Turks, are many Curds, 
Arabs, Jews, and Armenians. 

Diarbtkir, the ancient ^mida, formerly the capital of an independent State, is now the seat 
of a powerful pacha. It is surrounded bj a wall, supposed to be a Roman work, famous for 

its height and solidity. 
Mauy of the bouses are 
handsome, one mosque is 
magnificent, and the cas- 
tle is an ornament to the 
town. Manufactures and 
commerce are prosecuted 
with some degree of spir- 
it ; and the inhabitaatB 
amount to 60,000. 

Or/a, in Mesopotamia, 

is one of the finest cities 

in this country. It is the 

i ancient Edetta, and is 

I supposed to be the Ur of 

the Chatdeeg, where Abra- 
ham dwelt before he came 
toHaran. The city stands 
on the slope of a hill, and 
is 3 or 4 miles in com- 
pass. The streets are 
narrow, but well paved, 
and tolerably clean. The 
houses are all of stone 
and well built, and the 
city has numerous excel- 
lent bazars or markets. 
A small lake at one ex- 
tremity of the city sup- 
plies it with excellent wa- 
ter. On the bank of this 
lake stands the J^oique 
of Mraham, the most 
splendid and regular edi- 
fice of its kind m Asiatic 
Turkey. It is a square 
building, surmounted by 
3 domes, and a lofty min- 
aret rising from amidst t 
grove of tall cypresses. 
Every place of conse- 
^pproacktoMariM quence in the city bears 

some relation to the name 
of Abraham. The inhabitants are well-bred, polite, and tolerant, and the place is said to be 
the most agreeable residence io all the Turkish dominions. Population, 50,000. 

JUardin, in Mesopotamia, is remarkable for its situation. It stands on the summit of a lo% 
mountain, composed of while limestone. It is approached by a stairway cut in the rock, more 
than 2 miles in extent. It is a saying of the Turks, that the inhabitants never see a bird flymg 
over their town. It has manufactures of silk and cotton. Population, 20,000. 

Beer, in Mesopotamia, stands on the Euphrates, and has a casde commanding the passage

Fan, upon the lake of the same name, a strongly fortified and industrious city, is the aeit 
most important place in Armenia. It is of great antiquity, and in a neighboring hill are sboffo 
vast subterranean apartments, attributed by the Armenians to Semiramis. 

Kutaieh, the residence of the beglerbeg or governor-general of Anatolia, is a large city with 
50,000 inhabitants. Karahissar, in the neighborhood, noted for its opium and its woolen miD- 
ufactures, has a population of â‚¬0,000 souls. Brottssa or Buna Is one of the most ilourisbii^ 
cities of the empire ; it contains an ancient castle, a number of magnificent mosnues, bandsorie

11. tnhabitanU, Manntra, iic. The inhabitants are various, and many of them may be 

ranked as nations. They are Turks, 
Armenians, Greeks, Jews, Arabs, 
Turcomans, Koords or Curds, and 
others. The dress of the Turks is 
principally the same as in European 
Turkey, and that of the other nations 
composing tlie Asiatic dominions, has 
a general resemblance to it. The 
languages are Turkish, Arabic, Chal- 
dee, Koordish, Lingua Franca, and 
a motley mixture of all these. 

The character of the population is 
various and discordant. The Turk 
is everywhere the same haughty, in- 
dolent being. The Armenian is timid, 
obsequious, frugal, industrious, and 
avaricious. He traverses alt coun- 
tries for gain, and generally the fac- 
Tbrur. Tartar ffimMii. <ors of the Turks, the merchants, and 

mechanics, are Armenians. They 
are a very ancient people ; pliant to circumstances, bending to authority, and living by peaceful 
pursuits ; they have an animated physiognomy and good feetures ; they hve in large families, 
closely united. The Jews do not essentially differ from them. The Greek is, as elsewhere, 

subtile, cheerful, and adroit. The 
Turcomans ere boisterous, igno- 
rant, brave, and hospitable ; they 
will shed their blood in defence of 
those with whom they have eaten. 
The Koords are robbers and 
thieves, and one tribe is often at 
war with another. The amuse- 
ments of the various people, that 
inhabit Asiatic Turkey, are not 
of an intellectual or refined char< 
acter. Tricks of jugglers, exhi- 
bitions of dancing females, feats 
of horsemanship, and recitals of 
stories, are common. The an- 
nexed cut represents an oriental 
convenazione. The arts are in a 
very low state, and the chief end 
of education seems to be to read 
the Koran. The prevailing reli- 
gion is the Mahometan. There

iaed to the rich. The government is that of the Pachas, appointed by the Porte, and the laws

One of the chief attractions of the Troad is the " sepulchre of Ajax," a ttimulus, sunnoW 
by a shrine. The ruins of several temples cover a cfcnsiderable space with fragments of granw 
and marble. The tomb of Ilus is a high, conical tumulus, of a remarkable size. Otber im- 
mense tumuli bear, somewhat doubtfully, the names of Hector, Priam, and Paris. Near Alw 
vidria Troas, which is full of antiquities, is a granite column, nearly 38 feet long, and 5 feel3 
inches in diameter. The enormous masses of the aqueduct of Herodes Atticus, ibe Â»;Â«& 
of the city, and the fragments of many buildings, remain, Asia Minor has numberless ruins w

but our limits will not permit us to describe them. 

The remains of the ancient cities of Babylon and Nineveh are extensive, but indisiKci; 
those of the latter are on the Tigris, opposite Mosul, and tliose of the former, on tbe Euphn- 
tes, near Bagdad. About 12 miles from Bagdad, is a heap of brickwork, IS6 feet bigb, uii 
of the diameter of 100 feet. It is called Nimrod's Palace. This lower rises on a wide bMf 
of rubbish. The principal ruins of Babylon are immense mounds of brick, which seem voa

called the tower of Babel, and 
temple of Belus, or Birs Nimrood, 
is near the Euphrates. Its ap- 
pearance is that of a fallen and de- 
cayed pyramid, with the remains 
of a tower (Â»i the top. The tower 
is 60 feet in height, and the nih-

How truly are fulfilled the prophetic words of holy writ, uttered when " the glory of king- 
doms, the beauty of the Chaldee's excellency," was yet in the pride of power : " The wild 
beasts of the forests shall lie there, the dragons shall howl in her pleasant palaces." 

13. Hilary. From the earliest dawn of history to tbe present moment, these countries 
bare been the scene of the most Interesting events, and the empire of tbe world has been re- 
peatedly contested on the Mesopotamiao plains. In the obscurity of early history, the great 
Â«npires of Assyria and Babylon are dimly seen, overshadowing the known world, and finally 
both yield to the Persian arms, which swept all hefore them to the shores of the Mediterranean.

dcRtb, the poTrerTuI kingdom of the Seleucida, embraced most of the Ottoman (vpsincei of 
Asia. AntJoclius, in turn yielded to the alar of Rome, and the empire of that warlike republic 
was extended to the Euphrates. In the 7th century tiie Arab tribe of Saracens burst forth 
fiom their deserts, and proclaimed a new religion, and the empire of the caliphs once more 
restored ihe seat of dominion to Mesopotamia. This in turn crumbled and fell to pieces, and in 
the 1 5th century, all this part of Asia was subjected to the degrading yoke of the Otiomans.*

1. BowKJariet and Extent. This region, though it forms a part of the Ottoman empire is 
â– o celebrated in liisiory as to deserve a separaiedescription. It is bounded north by Asia Minor, 
on tlie south by Arabia, and on the west by that part of the Mediterranean often called Levant. 
Il extends from latitude 31" to 37Â° north, and from longitude 35" to 41" east, having an area of 
about 50,000 square miles, tviih 1,500,000 inliabitanis.

the principal chain near the coast

the highest summit, near Balbec, 
has an elevation of upwards of 
1 1 ,000 feet. The ^nli-Ubainu 
or interior chain rises to a greater 
height, some of its summits being 
upwards of 16,000 feet high. 
Mount Carmel and Mount Tahor 
are of historical celebrity. The 
latter is generally supposed to have 
been the scene of the transfigtm-

too great for the free growth of the date, orange, and lemon. " It 
has been remarked," says Matte Brun, " that if the advantages 
of nature were duly seconded by the eflbrts of human skill, we 
might, in the space of SO leagues, bring together in Syria all the 
T^etable riches of the most distant countries. Besides wheat, 
rye, barley, beans, and the cotton-plant, which are cultivated eve- 
rywhere, there are several objects of utility or pleasure, peculiar 
to different localities. Palestine, for instance, abounds in sesa- 
mum, which affords oil, and dfaoura, similar to that of Egypt. 
Maize thrives in the light soil of Balbec, and rice is cultivated 
â–  â€¢ with success along the marsh of Haoule. Within these 25 years 

^"^^ sugar-canes have been planted in the gardens of Saide and Bei- 

root ; indigo grows without culture on the banks of tne Jordan, and tobacco is cultivated id all 
the mountains. The white mulbeny forms the riches of the Druses, and the vines funiisb 
red and white wines equal to those oi Bordeaux. Jaffa boasts of its lemons and watermelons ; 
GaM possesses the dates of Mecca, and the pomegranate of Algiers. Tripoli has oranges 
which vie with those of Malta ; Beirout has figs like Marseilles, and bananas like St. Do- 
mingo ; Aleppo is unequaled for pistachio-nuts, and Damascus possesses all the fruits of Eu- 
rope, apjdes, plums, and peacbes growing with equal facility on her rocky soil." A peculiar 



*M SYRIA, 

interest is attached to several shrubs of this region, froni tber 
being mentioned in the scriptures, and some of these will do* 
be more particularly noticed. The fig-tree (Ficta coria) 
abounds in Pklestine, and the men, who were sent by Mosei n 
spy out the land of Canaan, brought with them figs and ftxt- 
granates. What we commonly esteem the fruit of the fig is mi. 
however, the fruit, but a receptacle containing numerous florets; 
in order to ripen this more surely the process of capnGcaiion Â« 

SerformeJ, that is, the receptacle is punctured in order !o p\t 
le male dust a more ready access to the female flonen. b 
the East this is effected by collecting a little insect from ihe nilii 
fig, and bringing them to the cultivated tree, where ihey pietw 
tne fruits id order to deposit their eggs. The sycamore tree of Scripture [F. sycamonu) is i 
â€¢ort of wild fig, the fruit of which, although quite bitter, was eaten by the Jews. The pww- 
granate {Punica granalwn) is commc^n in Syria and Aleppo, 
and is ofien mentioned in the scriptures. There are seven! 
sorts, one being sour, and the others, which are eaten at iible. 
si^eel. The husks, " which the swine did eat," and with nbicl) 
the prodigal was fain to fill himself, are supposed to be those ol 
the fruit of the carob or locust-tree (Ceratonia siliqua , a sui- 
die-sized tree with the seeds contauied in large pods ; ibex 
husks are still employed in Palestine for feeding cattle. Tbt 
locust tree is also called St. John's bread, from an idea tint in 
fruit was the locust spoken of as the food of John the Baptisi; 
but others think, that the word in ttiat passage means the ioseci, 
^PMBiwe. which is still eaten in the East. The palm-tree of the Bible a 

iw date palm (Phanix dactylifera) ^ the fruit of which Is eaten fresh or dried. Jericho ni 
called the city of palms from the abundance of these trees in its vicinity, and on the Komai 
coins the^ were emblematic of Judea. At the feast of iheit- 
bemacles, " goodly palm branches " were used in the ereciiw 
of the tents, and when our Savior entered Jerusalem, "tbt 
people took branches of the palm-tree, and went out to mfO 
him." The Jews in the northern countries still procure than 
for the Passover, at great expense. The olive {uUa) aliains 1Â° 
a great size in Palestine, which has always been famed for ilx 
excellence and abundance of its oil, and is described in Serif- 
ture as "A land of wheat and barley, of vines and Gg-treÂ« 
and pomegranates, aland of oil and honey." The cedar cl 
Lebanon (Pinus cedrus) is remarkable for its stately size, and 
wide -spreading branches, and the timber was highly esteemed bj 
the Jews (Â«e cut on the opposite page)- The temple and tk 
royal palace were built of wood, and it was used by the Tyrliw 
Paim-tTM. *''' masts. The Psalmist calls these trees " the cedars of God." 

They are now rare in Palestine. The terebinth tree (PUtaclat 
lenbintkui) la often mentioned in Scripture, and is called oak, in our translation. Isaiah threii- 
ens the idolaters, that they shall be as a terebintb-u^, v^ 
leaves fall off ; ilwt is, being an evergreen, when the tree die. 
It lives to a great age. The plane-Uee {Platanw orient^) 'Â» 
abundant in Palestine ; the thorns, with which our Lord Â«Â» 
crowned, were the spiny branches of the Spina CArirfi ; ll* 
balm of Gilead was the produce of the ,Smyrit OiUadtmii, >^

interspersed with some oases, or fertile and well-watered spots. But although the rest of tbe 
country abounds in fertile valleys, and enjoys a mild and delightful climate, the lyranof nd 
lawless violence of man have blasted it, and iterance, superstition, and barbarism nowconr 
the land long the abode of industry, arts, wealth, learning, and refinement. Agriculture, nunu^ 
lures, and commerce, discouraged by difficulties of communication, and insecurity of ptapertj. 
are in a languishing condiuon. The natural advantages of this 6ne coimtry have already bets 
described ; in conirast with these listen to the description of its actual condition by an ejt- 
witness. " Everywhere," says Volney, " I saw only tyrarmy and misery, robbery aod dens- 
tatjon ; I found daily on my route abandoned fields, deserted villages, cities in ruins. FrMjiKSi 
ly I discovered antique monuments, remains of temples, of palaces, and of fortresses ; piUi'^i 
aqueducts, and tombs ; this spectacle led my mind to meditate on past times, and eiciied ip 
my heart profound and serious thoughts. I recalled those ancient i^es, when 30 famous mudoi 
existed in these countries ; I painted to myself the Assyrian on the banks of the Tigris, im 
Chaldean on the Euphrates, and the Persian reigninf; from the Indiu to the Hediientnean- 1

taairr brilliant creations of the hand of man ^ Where are the rampar 
of Babylon, the palaces of Persepolis, the temples of Baalbec and J 
tbe fleets of l^re, the docks of Arad, the looms of Sidon, and the mi 
merchants, and soldiers ? Where are those kborers, those harvests, thoi 
of living beings which then covered the face of the earth ? Alas ! I ha 
bod, I have vbited the places which were the theatre of so much splei 
solitude and desertion. I have sought the ancient natioos and their worl 
trace, like that which the foot of the passenger leaves on the dust. T 
down, the palaces are overthrown ; the ports are filled up ; the cities 
earth, stripped of its inhabilanta, is only a desolate place of tombs." 

7. hhaoitaiUt. The population ii composed of^u various elements as that of Asiatic Tur- 

key. Ottoman Turks and Greeks 
are the principal inhabitaots of tb* 
eitiee ; Arabs and Turcomans are 
numerous ; in the mountainous re- 
gions there are several peculiar - 
tribes, the Druses, the IsmaeU- 
ans, and the Nosairians, of rude 
manners, and warlike and predato- 
ry habits. Tbe Ismaelians have 
become celebrated under tbe tume 
of Assassins, and their prince was 
known in the Middle Ages under 
the name of the Old Man of the 
Mountains ; from his mountain 
fastness he sent his fierce hathia- 
him o^ warriors forth upon expe- 
ditions of robbery and murder,

show the same boundless hospitality and tbe same deadly feuds as the Arabs. They have 
maintained their independence, and with it a spirit of energy and a vigor of character rarely 
found among the Syrian tribes. The aflairs of tbe nation are settled in an assembly of the 
â– heiks or hereditary chiefs, but the body of the people also take part in these meetines. 
Tbeir religious creed is a sort of Mabometanism, and owes its origin to Hakim, one of tbe 
Fatinute caliphs, nbo preached a reform in the lOdi century, and laid aside many of the pe- 
culiarities of that faith. They pray indiscriminately in a mosque or a church, and seem to re- 
gard Christianity with less aversion than Mabometanism. 

8. Religion. Tbe tribes last mentioned have adopted peculiar forms of Mabometanism, 
and in some instances, mixed it with other rites, and are looked upon as heretics by their 
brethren- The Motoualis are another heretical sect of Mahometans. The Maronites, a peo- 
ple of mountaineers near Tripoli, are Roman Catholic Christians. The other inhabitants are 
of tbe same religious sects as those of Asiatic Turkey. Roman and Greek Catholic, Coptic, 
Armenian, and other monks are found in Jerusalem, each occupying a chapel in the spots most 
remarkable for their sanctity. 

9. ^ntiqaUia. Some of the remains of past ages have been already alluded to, but tbey 
wre too numerous to be enumerated here. Among the most remarkable spots, Palmyra, or 
Tadmor in ihr desert, presents an imposing spectacle in rising from the sands of the desert

10. ffutory. Tbe name of Palestine seems to be derived from tlie ancient Philistines, but 
tbe country is more commonly known in Scripture first as the Promised Land and the Land 
(rf* Canaan, and afterwards, when occupied by the 12 tribes of Israel, as Judea. The people 
of the PbcEnician Slates, on the northeast, were early wealthy and commercial, and were 
generally on friendly terms with the Israelites, while the people of Syria were generally hos- 
tile. At a later period, all these regions were conquered by the Babylonians, the Persians, 
the Macedonians, tbe Romans, Saracens, and Turks, and have followed the fortunes of the 
great empires that swallowed them up. It was about 16 centuries befoÂ« Christ, that Mc^et 
conducted the oppressed Hebrews from the plains of E^pt, through the wastes of Arabia to 
tbe borders of Canaan, where be died, aAer having given them the laws dictated by God. Tbe

CHAPTER LXIII. ARABIA. 

1. Boundaries and Extent. Arabia is bounded N. by the pacbalics of Bagdad and I^""?* 
cus, in Asiatic Turkey ; E. by the Persian Gulf; 8. by tbe Indian Ocean ; and W. byw 
Red Sea. It extends from 12Â° to 34^ N. latitude, and from 33Â® to 59Â® E. longitude. TÂ» 
area is about 1,000,000 square miles. 

2. Divisions. Arabia was divided by the ancients into three parts ; Arabia Felix, or Ha^ 
Arabia, comprising the southwestern part of the country, boraering on the Indian O^^^^'J^ 
on the southern part of the Red Sea ; .Arabia Petrmay lying on the Red Sea, north of Ar^ 
Felix ; and Arahia Deserta^ much the largest division, embracing all tbe eastern and ooroo* 



Cn Â«f 4^9 MnHjF. ThÂ«ie names tre stiU in common use asKMig Europeans ; Am nattves, 
wey^T) divide ^tbe country into 5 parts, as follows ; 1. Yemen^ 2* JJedsjaSy 3. Omtmj 
4. liOchHi^ 5. Mdy&d, The first of these seems to correspond with Arabia FeUx, the second 
with Arat^ Petrea, and the three last with Arabia Desorta. 

3. MourUains^ jDeterto, &c. Arabia is an arid desert, interspersed with a few fertile spolSi 
which appear like islands in a desolate ocean. Stony mountains and sandy plains form the pv^* 
minent features in the surface of this vast peninsula. To the north, it shoots out mto a veijr 
extensive desert, lying between Syria and the countries on the Buphrates. The whole coast 
of Arabia, from Suez to the head of the Persian Gulf, is formed of a plain caUed the Teham^f 
which presents a picture of the most complete desolation. The interior is diversified by exten* 
stTe ranges of mountains, but there is no river of any consequence in aU Arabia ; almost eveiy 
stream either losing itself in the sandy plains, or expanding into moors and fens. 

4. CUmate. In the mountainous parts, the climate is temperate ; but in the plains, intoler- 
able heat prevails. A hot and pestiferous wind, called the rimoom^ firequently blows over tbe 
desert, and instantly suffocates the unwary traveler ; and whole caravans are sometimes binried 
by moving clouds of sand raised by the wind. In almdst every part of the country, they suffer 
for want of water. 

5. Soil and Productions. The soil, wherever it is well watered, exhibits an uncommon 
fertility ; but where this is aot the ^ase, it degenerates into a waste, affording barely a scanqr 
suTOort to a lew wBd animals and the cameb ofthe wandering Arabs. The most fertile distriet 
is 1 emen, or Arabia Felix, which in many parts is cultivated like a garden. Although so large 
a part of tJhe country is a mere desert, vet Arabia yields several of the most precious produo- 
tioos of the vegetable kingdom. The forests are mostly confined to the mountains and adjacent 
ralleys. In all Tehama, there is scarce a Uree to be seen beside the palm. The conoe plam 
is generally supposed to be a native of Arabia Felix, where it arrives at the greatest perfec- 
ticm, and whence Europe first derived its knowledge of the berry and its use. The plant grows 
to the height of 15 or 30 feet, with a stem 4 or 5 inches in diameter, and its copious evergpMi 
foliage, white flowers, and red berries make a pleasing show. The Mocha coffee {Coffea Artk- 
hiea)y the species or variety cultivated in Arabia, is distingubhed by the roundness and small* 
ness of the grain. Balsam, frankincense, and myrrh, gum, aloes, senna, and tamarinds are also 
staple commodities of Arabia. The balsam or balm of Gilead is the produce of two species 
of Jtmyrii (Ji, GiUademis and Jl. Opobalsamum)^ and myrrh b a nim resin which exudes 
from a third species (Â«i9. Kataf), Frankincense is the produce of the oliban {Juniperus Lycta), 
and the ancient Hebrews, as well as the modem Catholics, derived their incense from Arabia* 
Gam arable b yielded by the acacia (Ji. Jlrabica), and the Soccotrine aloes is afforded by the 

Jiloe officinalis. The Arabian senna is the foliage of a species 
of cassia (C. LanceokUa)^ and the knowledge of its valuable 
properties was derived from the Arabian physicians. TamarindU 
are the fruit of the beautiful Tamarindus ojicina^ which is now 
cultivated in all the warm regions of the globe. Arabia was 
formerly thought by Europeans to yield the spikenard, cinna- 
mon, cassia, cordamons, pepper, &c., which are now known 
to have been imported hither from the Indies, and thence seni 
to Europe. Cocoa nuts, pomegranates, dates, almonds, figs, 
oranges, lemons, peaches, and roangosteen, are also among the 
fruits of Arabia, and in some parts wheat is raised, but the 
dhoura {Helens sorgkum)^ a coarse kind of raiUet, is the most 
common bread-corn. 

6. Towns, The western part of Arabia, forming the Sberifat 
^l^j^ of Mecca, belongs to Egypt ; the chief town is Mecca^ cele- 

brated as the birthplace of Mahomet, situated in a dry, barren, 
aod rocky country, 40 miles from the Red Sea. It is supported by the concourse of pilgrims 
from every part of the Mahometan world. The chief ornament of Mecca is the famous 
mosque, in the interior of which is the Kaaba, an ancient temple said to have been built by 
Abraham ; it is a plain, square building of stone. The most sacred relic in the Kaaba is the 
Uack stone, said to have been brought by the angel Gabriel. The ^nd ceremony throu^ 
which pilgrims pass b that of goine 7 times round the Kaaba, recitmg verses and psahns in 
honor of God and the prophet, and kissing each time the sacred stone. They are then conducted

tue, is the pMgrimHge to Mount Ara&t, situated about 30 mites to the south of the ciij. Tbs 
population of Mecca, formerly estimated at 100,000, is now reduced to 60,000, the resort of 
pilgrims within a few years having been greatly interrupted. Jidda, on the Red Sea, serves u 
the port of Mecca. It is the prmcipal place on that sea, and is strongly fortified and occu^ed 
by an Egyptian garrison. Population, 40,000. Medina is also a sacred city of the Maboi&e- 
* tans. One of the roosque:

ciently celeb.-ated. The ruins of its cap- 
ital, Petra, lisfe lately been discovered, 
which display great magnificence ; m^ 
of the edifices were cut out of the st^d 
rock. 

On the northern part of the Hed Sea, 

POgrimt M Oar wiy fp (*Â« 7M <>/' JV<U<nÂ«(. Stands Maba, a little vUlage, near the site 

of which is the port of Etiongtber, from 

which the ships of Solomon sailed to Ophir, and by which the Phcenicians carried on their 

eonunerce with India. To the west are Mount Horeb, upon which God appeared to Moses, 

and commandeti him to deliver Im 
countrymen ; and Momit Si%ai, 
upon which he gave the law. Here 
is a monastery, armed with caoDon, 
and accessible only by means of â–  
rope. 

The Imamat of Yemen is a 
powerful State in the southwest. 
The capital and residence of the- 
Imam is Sana, built in the midst 
of a fertile plain, and surrounded 
with high brick walls and towers. 
Population, about 30,000. Mocha, 
situated near the southern extremi- 
ty of Arabia, is the principal port 
on the Red Sea, and the channel 
JVomi Smai, through which almost all the inter' 

course of Europe with this pan of 
the worid is carried on. The great article of export is cofiee, which is celebrated as the Goest 
in.ihe world ; (he population is estimated at 5,000. 

The Imamat of Mascat on the eastern coast, is likewise jin important State. The Imam re- 
sides at Maieat or Mtacat, a large ciiy, surrounded with gardens and groves of date trees. It 
is the centre of an active commerce with India, and a great market for pearls. The govent- 
toent of the Imam is the most tranquil and beneficent of any in the maritime parts of Persia or 
Arabia. All the ports upon this coast are tributary to him, and be has subjected Socoira, 
Brava, Zeu, Zibar, and other important points on the African coast. He also holds the 
-slands of Kistima end Ormuz, in the Persian Gulf, and a considerable extent of the Persiao 
coast around Gombroon. This capital has a spacious and secure harbor, though difficult of 
access, and is become a Reneral depot for the merchandise of Persia, India, god Arabia. 
_ The kingdom of the Wababiles, who a few years since had reduced a great part of *hejÂ»- 
niosula, but were overthrown by the arms of the Egyptians, is in the region of Nedsbed. "tht, 
eapiul, Dtrriah, was destroyed in 1818. 



ARABIA. 4Sy 

There are manj other pet^ States id Arabia, and a great number of the inhabitants, living 
B WDall tribes, lead a wandenns life ; acknowledging no superiors, but their own chiers. 

7. bthMtanitf &c. The Arabs are pastoral, aa Bedouins, or they live in towns. Thej have 
dark hair and black eyes, and they are well 
formed and active, though lean, 'i'hey per- 
mit their beards to grow to their full length. 
The Arabs are spread over 8yria, Palestine, 
Mesopotamia, anti Africa. The dress of the 
rich resembles somewhat that of Turks ; be- 
ing loose and flowing. . The chief peculiarity 
is the number of caps, which sometimes 
amounts to 15. The poor, however, wear 
but 3, and their chief clothing is a linen clotb 
round the middle, and a woolen one over the 
shoulders. This also serves them for the 
covering at night ; 'though sometimes tbe^ 
sleep in bags, for protection from insects. 
BtdotU Aaht ^'** -E"**' "^'^ sandals ; the rich, slippers. 

The Bedouins wear no caps, but only a nood 
in tbeir cloak. The Arabian females stain their eyelids with a dark substance, and their cheeks 
SDd hands with a yellow color. The language is the Arabic, but it js not spoken in its ancient 

Eurity. The Arabic of the Koran Is, at Mecca, a dead language. The buildings in the ciuea 
ive terraced roofs, but they have no beauty. The dwellings of the poor are hut huis, with 
Dtats covering the 6oor3. The Bedouins dwell in tents. In food the Arabs are temperate in 
tbe extreme. The poor satisfy themselves with dales, &c., or a daily meal of hard bread, with 
milk, butter, or oil. Little animal food is eaten, and the use of wine ox spirits is not common ; 
lixards and locusts are sometimes ealen. Colfee is generally used, and tobacco also in smok- 
ing. A species of hemp is also smoked, for its intoxicating qualities. A diet so simple can 
create few diseases, ana the Arabs generally enjoy perfect health. The character of the 
Arabs is founded upon that of Ishmael. In the desert (bey are robbers, and in cities cheating 
is a substitute for robbery. They are, however, very courteous and polite, and hospitable to 
a proverb. They will set their last loaf before a stranger. It is a bitter sHrcasra for cne tribe 
to use against another, " that the men know not how to give, or the women to deny." It is, 
however, seldom founded in truth. All go armed, and they are probably but little changed 
lince the time of Mahomet, or an earlier period. They are revengeful, and visit ofi'enceg 
with full retaliation ; often upon the innocent, if of the same family or tribe with the offender. 

The only safe way of traveling in Arabia, as in other countries of Asia and Africa, Is io 
caravans. A caravan is a large association of merchants or pilgrims, who unite for mutual aid 
and protection to themselves and their camels and goods. Tbe transportation of goods in 
these countries, though slow, is cheap, compared with European prices. The average weight 
which camels are made to carry is 600 pounds. The Egyptian caravans travel with a wide 
front, many others travel In a line. The halt of the pilgrim caravans to Mecca, is by day, and 
they travel only by night. There are many of these even from Persia and Morocco. The 
dangers of the desert are such, that in many places the route is indicated by the bones of dead 
camels. The caravans are under the directions of a chief, though from their discordant mate- 
rials they are, when attacked, in a state of confusion, each individual acting for himself, and 
protecting his own property. The predatory tribes on the route sometimes plunder the whole 
caravan, and at others cut off parts oi it. At the halts there is much social intercourse and 
amusement, the merchants or others visiting and entertaining each other. Caravans, however, 
since the extension of navigation, and the decline of the Mahometan spirit, have been much 
curtailed both in magnitude and show. The pace of the camel when traveling Is 3 miles an 
boor ; this is so exact that distances are computed by time ; a march of 6 hours being equiva- 
lent to 18 miles. 

The education of few exceeds the reading of the Koran ; and tbe religion of all is bounded 
by its doctrines. They are intolerant Mahometans, but chiefly of the refoiiued sect of 
Wehabees. This seems to be nearly a pure theism ; the founder inculcated great simpllcitr 
of life, and subverted the reverence for prophets and saints. The sect are so strict in then 
tfnplicity of life, that they wiU not drink even coffee. The government is what it has heeo

from remote ages, puriarchd> The abeilu are the cfaiels of tribes, but their aatbcsi^ is fiKnl* 
ed, for the Arabs have a high spirit of freedom. In the cities a stronger government obtaJia, 
â– od the Sheriffe of Mecca, or Imam of Mascat, are more despotic. 

8. Hittory, Arabia b famous in history for giving birth to the Mahometan religion. Ma- 
homet, its founder, was bora at Mecca, 
in 969. From the leader of a sect he be- 
came a powerful military chieftain, aod wk 
proclaimed king at Medina, in 627. He 
conquered a great part of Arabia and Syria; 
and the KMllfs, his successors, establish- 
ed their religion and dominion in many couo- 
tries of Asia) Africa, and Europe. The 
Turks afieraards became masters of a pan 
of Arabia, but the chiefs who now rule the 
diffiirent provinces of the country are indepe*. 
dent except that the Shirefie of Mecca ae- 
Iht n^ </ MtAtmH. knowledges a nominal subjection to the Otto- 

man Porte. 

CHAPTER LXIV. PERSIA OR IRAN. 

1. Boundariet. The present kingdom of Persia, which includes but a part of the exleo- 
sive country of the Persians, is bounded north by Turkistan, the Caspian Sea and the Russia! 
empire ; east by the kingdoms of Herat and Cabul, and by Beloochisian : south by the Gulf 
of Ormuz and Uie Persian Gulf, and west by the Ottoman territories. It extends from lat. 36** 
to 39Â° N., and from long. 44Â° to 61Â° Â£., having an area of 450,000 square miles, and a pop- 
ulation of 9,000,000 inhabitants. 

2. MoutUaint and Riven. Two mountainous chains, belonging to the great Tauro-Catica- 
sian system, traverse the country in different directions ; the one stretching east and west to 
the south of Mazanderan, uuder the name of the Elburz mountains, has an elevation of above 
12,000 feet ; the volcanic peak of Demavend In ibis chain, is nearly 13,000 feet high ; the 
other ciiain stretches from nordiwest to southeast, under the name of the mountains of Curdis- 
(ao and Lurislan. A great part of tlie country to the south and east of these chains is com- 
posed of immense deserts and salt plains. The northwestern part forms a portion of the great 
table-land, upon which are situated all Armenia, AJerbnan, Curdlstan, &.c. ; this plateau is 
from 4,000 to 8,000 feet high. The principal lakes are Ourmiah in Ajerbtjan, and BakhUga* 
in Farsistan, both salt. Some rivulets, falling from the mountains, wacer ihe country, but their 
streams are so inconsiderable, that few of them can be navigated even by boats. In conse- 
quence of this deGciency, water is scarce ; but the defect, where it prevails, is admirably sup- 
pUed by mp.aQs of reservoirs, aqueducts, and canals. 

3. Climatt. Those parts of Persia which border upon the mountains near the Caspian Sea, 
are in general cold, as those heights are commonly covered with snow. In the midland prov- 
inces of Persia, the air is serene, pure, and exhilaratbg ; but, in the southern provinces, it is 
hot, and communicates noxious blasts, which are sometimes mortal. 

4. &oH and Productiotu. The soil is far from being luxuriant toward Tarlary and tbe Cas- 
piaa Sea ; but with cultivation it might produce abundance of corn and fruit. To the south of 
mount Taurus, the country abounds in com, fruit, wine, and the other necessaries and luxuries 
of life. It affords oil in plenty, senna, rhubarb, and the finest drugs. Great quantises of ex- 
cellent silk are likewise produced in this countiy ; and the Gulf of Bassora fotmerly furnished 
great part of Europe and Asia with very fine pearls. Some parts, near Ispahan especiallr, 
produce almost all the flowers that are valued in Europe ; and from some of them, particulaHy 
roses, they extract waters of a salubrious and odorific kind, which form a gainful commodily in 
trade. Few places produce the necessaries of life In greater abundance and perfeciion than 
Shiraz ; and a more delightful spot in nature can scarcely be conceived, than the vale in which 
it is situated, either for the salubrity of the air, or for the profusion of everything necessary to 
render life comfortable and agreeable. The fields ylelcf plenty of rice, wheat, and barley, 
which they generally begin to reap m May, and by the middle of July the harvest is complet* 
â€¢d. Most of tbe European fruits are produced here, and many of them are superior In sitt

and flftror to what can be raised iii Europe, partieularty the apricot, grape, and pomegraiiata. 
The last b good to a prorerb ; the Persians, in their pompous style, call it the fruit of Paradise. 
$. Jifinerab. Persia contains mines of iron, copper, lead, and, above all, turkois-stones, 
which are (bund in Kborasan. Sulphur, salt-petre, and antimony, are found in the mountains. 
Quarries of red, white, and black marble hare also been discorered near Taurus. Salt is abun- 
dant, and, in many places, the surface is covered with a saUne crust when left to itself. Bito- 
men and naptha are found in all the countries bordering on the Tigris and Lower Euphrates ; 
chenr serve as cement, as pitch for lining the bottoms of vessels, and as a substitute for oiL Pe* 
tcoliiim occurs in Kerman. 

6. Divieums. The ku^dom is divided into 11 provinces, at the head of each of which is a 
beglerbeg^ or governor-in*chief, and subdivided into districts, administered by hakimfj or gov*- 
emors. It must be observed, that many of the tribes of Curds and Luris, and several Turko- 
man tribes in Khorasan are entirely independent. Provinces : Irak-Ajemi, Thabaristan, Mi^ 
sanderan, includmg Astrabad, Ghilan, Ajerbijan, Curdistan, Khusi^an, Farsbtan, including 
Lfaristen, Kerman, Khuhistan, and Khorasan. 

7. Cities. Teherany in the northwestern part of the province of Irak, is now considered as 
the capital of Persia. It b about 4 miles in circumference, situated in a dreary plain, which 
is only partially cultivated. It is fumbhed with a citadel, and surrounded by a strong wall ; 
but it b not a handsome or well-built town. Within the fortress b the palace, which displnyi 
ao external magnificence. So excessive is the heat of the summer in this neighborhood, that 
the king, and the greater part of the inhabitants, annually leave it for 2 or 3 months. The 
population is then under 15,000 ; but, during the rest of the year, it amounts to 50,000. 

lipahan^ formerly the Persian capital, with a population of 700,000 souls, is seated on a fine 
plain, withm a mile of the river Zenderood. It contains some few squares and noble houses ; 
but the streets are neither wide nor regular, and the town in general is wretchedly built. It 
bears evident marks of neglect ; yet it is not so deserted, as to have only' a small population ; 
for it b still occupied by about 100,000 persons. The bazars are so extensive, that you may 
walk for 2 or 3 miles under the shelter which they afibrd. The best manuiactures of the place 
are those of silk and cotton ; the latter stuff resembles nankin, and b worn by all ranks, from 
the king to the peasant. The chief ornament of the town is the Palace of Forty PiUars, 
called also the Persian Versailles. The exhaustless profusion of its splendid materiab, may be 
said to reflect, not merely their own golden or crystal lights on each other, but all the variegat- 
ed colors of the garden ; so that the whole surface seems formed of polished silver and mother- 
of-poarl, set with precious stone^. In short, the scene seems almost to realize an eastern poet's 
dream, or some magic vision. The roof is sustained by a double range of columns, each being 
40 ieet high, and shooting up from the united backs of 4 lions of white marble, while their 
shafts are covered with arabesque patterns and foliage. The ceiling is adorned with the repre- 
sentations of flowers and animals, m gold, silver, and painting, amidst hundreds of intermingling 
compartments of glittering mirrors. The New Palace b also a fine edifice. One of the ba- 
zar9 presents a long, covered walk of 2 miles in length, lighted by domes, and lined with shops, 
but no longer exhibits the bustle and life of former days. Some of the nK>sques, and the 
bridges over the Zenderood are also remarkable structures, and diere are several colleges or 
madrasses here. The Jews and Armenians are numerous in Ispahan. 

The other principal towns of thb province are, Cashan^ noted for its manufactures of cotton, 
silk, and copper ware, with 30,000 inhabitants ; Kotnny cdebrated as the burial-place of several 
Mahometan saints, whose tombs, remarkable for the splendor and richness of their decora- 
tions, are vbited by thousands of pilgrims from all parts of the kingdom ; Hamadan^ a flomish- 
ing and industrious town, with 30,000 inhabitants, and Caxuten^ a large town, with extensive 
manufactures and a thriving trade, and containing 60,000 inhabitants. Near Hamadan are the 
ruins of Echatana^ once tlie magnificent capital of the Medes ; the remains of the palace, 
which was nearly a mile in circuit, and of which the woodwork was of cedar and cypress, over^ 
bid with silver and gold, aid the tiles of silver, are still visible. Balfrouchy m Mazamleran, 
is a large town with 100,000 inhabitants, mostly engaged in trade and manufactures ; its bazars 
ve of vast extent. Joterabody on the Caspian Sea, with 40,000 inhabitants ; Son, 80,000 ; 
aad SUdUy 60,000, with octensive silk manufiictures, are the other principal places in thb 
quarter. 

Tauris or Tabriz stands on a plain bounded by mountains, which, though barren, recede into 
a wefl-cultivated vale. In the 17th century it was considered as the second city in Persia ; but, 



4K TEMBOl, Oft I&Air. 

if it had not become the priiidpal residence of the hte heir apparent df the Persian crowii, k 
would by this time have declined into insignificance. He improved the fortifications, formed i 
great arsenal, and built a palace for himself, encouraged the industry of the inhabitants, and pro- 
moted European arts and inventions. The population of 'the town is about 45,000. drwM 
-was formerly a large and flourishing town ; but it has now only 4,000 inhabitants, though it fot 
lesses a great object of Moslem veneration, namely, the magnificent mausoleum of that saiK- 
tified sheik who was the founder of the Sefi family. 

Kermanshaw^ in Curdistan, stands in the midst of a delightful district, and is surrounded bj 
walls. Its prosperity is due to its commerce and manufactures.* Population, 40,000. Wmttr^ 
the capital of Khusistan, has 20,000 inhabitants. In its neighbomood, are the ruins whicb 
mark the site of the ancient Susa. It was the winter residence of the ancient Persian kings, 
and was 15 miles in circuit ; here is shown the tomb of the prophet Daniel, to which the Jem 
make pilgrimages. 

Shirazy in a delightful valley of Farsistan, is meanly built, but contained some magnificeot 
edifices previously to 1824, when most of its principal buildings were destroyed by an eardi- 
quake. The environs of Shiraz have been celebrated by the Persian poets for their fine wines 
and beautiful scenery, and the city is styled bv the Persians, the seat of science, on account of 
the literary taste of its inhabitants. Population, 30,000. Yezd, in the interior, on the great 
earavan routes, (he centre of a great inland trade, and the seat of extensive manufactures, with 
60,000 inhabitants ; and Busheerj the principal port on the Persian Gulf, with 15,000 iobalii' 
tarns, are the other principal places of this province. To the northeast of Shiraz are the cele- 
brated ruins of Persepolisy covering a great extent of country ; those called by the PersiiiB 
Chilminar (that is, the Forty Columns), are thought to be the remnants of the ancient palace 
of the Persian kings ; they consist of columns, and walls constructed of vast blocks of marble, 
and covered with reliefs and inscriptions ; tombs cut in the rock, and covered with inscriptions 
and sculptures, are also found in dififerent directions. 

Meshedj though the capital of Khorasan, is not so populous or flourishing as Herat, bar- 
mg only about 40,000 inhabitants. Its manufactures, it is said, are not extensive ; but it 
still retains its former celebrity for some articles. Its velvets are considered as the best b 
Persia ; but its silks and cottons are less famous. Sword-blades of good temper are hm 
fabricated, their excellence being derived, it is said, from the skill of many descendants of a col- 
ony of artisans, transplanted from Damascus to this province by Timour. The city is built of 
sun-dried bricks ; the houses in general make a wretched appearance, and the apartments are 
meanly furnished ; and a great part of the city is in ruins. Yet some of the public buildings bare 
an air of magnificence. The tomb of Ali, the patron saint of Persia, in the construction of 
which the genius of the Persian artists and the superstition of the devotees have lavished eyeij- 
thing that talents and wealth could contribute to render it magnificent, is much visited by pil- 
grims. 

8. Revenues. The king claims one third of the cattle, corn, and (ruit, of his subjects, and 
likewise a third of silk and cotton. No persons, of whatever rank, are exempted from serere 
taxations and services. The governors of provinces have particular lands assigned to them h 
maintaining their retinues and troops ; and the crown lands defray the expenses of the court, tbe 
king's household, and great officers of state. The water that is let into fields and gardens, is 
subject to a tax ; and foreigners, who are not of the established religion, pay a ducat a bead. 
Yet, accordmg to Mr. Kinneir, the revenue does not far exceed 3,000,000 sterling. 

9. Army. The Persian army is an untrained rabUe, who more commonly plunder their owd 
countrymen than their enemies. In the late war with Russia, the troops in the field, both reg- 
ular and irregular, amounted to less than 45,000 men. 

10. Commerce and Manufactures. Some trade is carried on with India throbgfa the porta 
Bushire, on the Persian Gulf ; and there are about a dozen vessek on the Caspian engaged Â» 
commerce with the Russians. Raw and manufactured silk and cotton goods, O'P^^^' |^ 
shawls, are exported. Some cutlery and coarse glass are also manufactured. The trade wits 
Turkey and Tartary is carried on by caravans. 

11. Population. There are no data from which to estimate the population, except tbe lo<^ 
(Conjectures of travelers. The country is thinly inhabited. The stationary population nay be 
about 10,000,000. 

12. Inhabitants. There are many separate tribes of people composing the populauoo of 
Persia. Beside the Tadshiks or Persians proper, there are many Parsees, Cords, andLon^ 



PEBÂ«A, OR IBAN.

vriio abo btkNig to the same family. Turkonnuis, in the northeast, Aiabs, m tbe sonthweat, 
Armenians, Jews, &c., are also numerous, and the Turkomans lure now the dominant nation, 
although the mass of the population is Persian. The Turkish is the common language of 
the country, the Parsees oniy speaking the Persian, which is, however, the language of the lite* 
nUure of an earlier period. Generally speaking, the Persians are a handsome race, even 

when unmixed ; but the Georgian, Circassian, and Mingrelian 
slaves are so common, that there are few of the higher classes, 
which are not descended from them. The Persian dress has 
been considered effeminate. The men wear a long robe, reach- 
ing nearly to the feet, and under this a vest tight to the hips, and 
then flowing like a petticoat. They wear wide trowsers and silk 
or calico shirts. Kobes of various kinds are common, and a long 
muslin sash is worn over the whole dress. In this is stuck a dag- 
ger, and no Persian considers himself fully dressed without a 
sword. All classes wear a black lambskin cap, about a foot in 
height. The head is shaved except a tuft on the head, and be- 
hind the ears. The beard is dyed black. The dress of the fe- 
males is simple. In winter a close-bodied robe, reachmg to the 
knees, and buttoned in front, is worn over the vest. In summer 
a silk or muslin shift b worn, loose velvet trowsers, and a vest. 
The head is covered with a black turban, over which a cashmerian shawl is thrown as a veil. 
The Persian language is well fitted for poetry. It has an affinity with the German and Goth- 
ic languages. The general food of the Persians is simple. Coffee is general, and tobacco 
is smoked by all classes. The delicious wines of Persia are much used, in spite of the pro- 
hibition of the Koran. The Persians have been called, probably by a Frenchman, the Pa- 
risians of the East, but they have more resemblance to the Greeks. They are volatile, cheer- 
ful, versatile, cunning, lying, and dishonest, but eminently social. They show great respect for 
age. They abound in complimentary phrases, and their politeness, like that of the other Asiat-^ 
ics, is formal, though less grave than that of the Turks. They are affable, and fond of conver- 
sation ; in which fables and apologues abound.* Their manner of salutation is to touch the 




Persians. 



* The following fmble !â–  a fair speeioien of the Persian 
figurative mode of ipeech. 

'* la former dayi there was an old woman, who lived in 
% Iiot more confined than the minds of the ignorant, and 
oiore dark than the toAibs of misers. Her companion was 
a eat, from the mirror of whose ima^natinn the appear- 
ance of bread had never been reflected, nor had she from 
firiends or strangers ever heard its name. It was enough 
that sbe now and then scented a mouse, or observed the 
print of its feet on the floor ; when, blessed by favoring 
fltarsy or benignast fortune, one fell into her claws, 

She became Ukt a beggar who discovers a treasure of 

pold; 
Her cheeks glowed with rapture, and past grief was con- 

>nniedl>y present joj. 

" This ieast would last for a week or more ; and while 
â€¢ojojing it she was wont to rzclaim, â€” 

'An I, O God ! when I eonteroplate this, in a dream or 

awake? 
Am I to experience such prosperity afler such adversity ? ' 

** But as the dwelling of the old woman was in general 
Che mansion of famine to this cat, she was always com- 
oUkring, and forming eitravagant and fanciful schemes. 
One day, wnen reduced to extreme weakness, she, with 
noeh exertion, reached the top of the hut ; when there, 
dm observed a oat stalking on the wall of a neighbor's 
hoose^ which like a fierce tiger advanced with measured 
steps, and was so loaded with flesh, that she could hardly 
rniae her foeU The old woman's friend was amazed to see 
mm of her own species so fat and sleek, and broke oat 
m the following exclamation : 

Toor stately strides have brought you here at last; pray, 

teU me from whence ^ou come ? 
Wnm whenoe have you arrived with so lovely an appear* 



Ton look as if from the banquent of the Khan of ChatAL 
Where have you acquired such a comeliness ? and bow 
came you by that glorious strength ? ' 

The other answered, * 1 am the Sultan's crum-eater. 
Â£ach morning, when they spread the convivial table, 1 at- 
tend at the palace, and there exhibit my address and cour- 
age. From among the rich meats and wheat-cakes I cull 
a few choice morsels ; 1 then retire and pass my time till 
next day in delightful .indolence/ 

** The old dame's cat requested to know what rich meat 
was, and what taste wheat-cakes had ? * As for me,* she 
added, in a melancholy tone, ' during my life, I have 
neither eat nor seen anything but the old wonoan's ^tnel 
and the flesh of mice.* The other smiling, said, ' This ae- 
counts for the difficulty 1 find in distinguishing you from 
a spider. Your shape and stature is such as must make 
the whole generation of the cats blush ; and we must ever 
feel asham^, while you carry so miserable an appearance 
abroad. 

You certainly have the ears and tail of a cat. 
But in other respects you are a complete spider. 

Were you to see the Sultan's palace, and to smell his de- 
licious viands, most undoubtedly those withered boties 
would be restored; you would receive new life; von 
would come from behind the curtain of invisibility inte 
the plain of observation : 

When the perfume of his beloved passes over the tomb 

of a lover. 
Is it wonderful that his putrid bones should be re-anl- 

mated.'* 

<* The old woman's cat addressed the other in the moil 
supplicating manner : * Ob, my sister ! * she eidaime^

we not linked in the ties of kindred ? what prevents yonr

by thrice bowing to the ground. There is much difference between the naanner of life 90i 
enaracter of the inhabitants of the towns and the country. The latter are brave and hardy, 
while the former are timid and effeminate. The females -are generally instnicled in readingi 
embroidery, and household affairs, of which they have the sole management. 

The Persian amusements are hunting, which they follow with great zeal, and various exhibi- 
tions of dancing, juggling, story-telling, &c. Antelopes are hunted with hawks and 
hounds. The hawk alights upon the head, disordering the motions of the antelope, w 
hound is therefore able to overtake. Education b generally diffused in Persia. 
generally, can read and write ; but there is little instruction in the higher branches, 
and sciences have hardly an existence. The most general and popi^r literature is 
in poems and romantic tales. Ferdoosee, Hafii^, and Saadi are poets, admired in Eii 
translations, and the two former are as well known to the common people as Bums to 
class in Scotland. The religion is the Mahometan, but the Persians are of the sects of 
Sheeahs. They believe that Ali, and not Omar, was the rightful successor of 
There is also some slight difference, in form, as in the manner of prostration, &c., whi 
der much hatred between the Persians and Turks. Soofeeism, a sort of mystical c 
accommodates itself to all forms of religion, is gradually undermining Mahometanism . 
sia, while it leaves nothing definable in its place. TlWe are few Armenian, Nestoi 
cobite, and Catholic Christians. There is a Catholic Mission, but few converts are 
The Persians, however, seem more easy to be led to a better creed thmi the other A 
They willingly discuss the merits of different religions, and are thus open to oonvictioD, and 
may be enabled to choose the best. The Parsees or Guebres are called Fire Worshippers, 
because they venerate fire as the emblem of the Supreme Being ; their sacred book is called 
the Zendevesta ; it teaches, that from the Supreme Being or the Eternal One, have enumaced 
Ariman, the genius of evil, and Oromaz the genius of good. 

Polygamy, as in other Mahometan countries, is general with the wealthy ; for the poor en 
generally support but one wife. Marriages are generally contracted by the parents, while the 
parties are young. After funerals, the friends of the deceased mourn 40 days, during which they 
leave viands on the grave for the angels, who are supposed to watch it. They also exposudata 
with the dead for having died. The government of Persia is an absolute, oriental despotism, 
with the absurd and peculiar feature, that the edicts of the monarch are unchangeable. He can- 
not alter them himself, so that he is bound by nothing but his own edicts.* The laws are 
founded on the precepts of the Koran. Sanguinary and barbarous punishments are conunoo* 
The higher classes of people are punished frequently by mutilation or loss of eyes, and the sU^ 




aÂ»xt you visit the palace ? Perhaps from yoar favor plen- 
ty may flow to me, and from your patronage I may attain 
dignity and honor. 

Withdraw not from the friendship of the honorable ; 
Abandon not the support of the elect/ 

'* The heart of the Sultan's crum -eater was melted by 
this pathetic address ; she promised her new friend should 
accompany her on the next visit to the palace. The latter, 
overjoyed, went down immediately from the terrace, and 
communicated every particular to the old woman, who ad- 
dressed her with the following counsel : 

** * Be not deceived, my dearest friend, with the worldly 
language you have listened to; abandon not your corner 
of content, for the cup of the covetous is only to be filled 
by the dost of the grave ; and the eye <^ cupidity and hope 
aan only be closed by the needle of mortality and the 
thread of fate. 

It is content that makes men rich : 
Mark this, yt avaricious, who traverse the world : 
He neither knows nor pays adoration to his God, 
Who is dissatisfied with his condition and fortune.' 

But tlie expected feast had taken such possession of poor 
piifls*s imagination, that the medicinal counsel of the old 
womaa was thrown away. 

'The good advice of all the world is like wind in a cage, 
Or water in a sieve, when bestowed on the headstrong.' 

'*To eonolude, next day, accompanied by her eom- 



panion, the half-starved eat hobbled to the 8u1tan â–  palwe. 
before this unfortunate wretch came, as it is decreed, tksi 
the covetous shall be disappointed, an extraordinary event 
had occurred, and, owing to her evil destiny, the water of 
disappointment was poured on the flame of her ioimlan 
ambition. The case was this } a whole legion of cats had, 
the day before, surrounded the feast, and made so moÂ«k 
noise, that they disturbed the guests, and in coDseaaence 
the Sultan had ordered, that some archers, armed with 
bows, from Tartary, should, on this day, be concealed, and 
that whatever cat advanced into the field of valor, covered 
with the shield of andacitv, should, on eating the firM 
morsel, be overtaken with their arrows. The old dane's 
puss was not aware of this order. The moment the flavor 
of the viands reached her, she flew, like an eagle to the 
place of her prev. 

** Scarcely had the weight of a mouthful been p lae td ia 
the scale to balance her hunger, when a heart-divididg ar 
row pierced her breast. 

A stream of blood rushed from the wound. 
She fled, in dread of death, after having exclaimM, 
' Should I escape from this terrific archer, 
I will be satisfied with my mouse and the miserable hoi 

of my old mistress. 
My soul rejects the hone^ if accompanied by the aluig. 
Content, with the most frugal fare, is preferable.* '

The antiquiues of Persia are the remains of a race more eaergetic than the present inbabi- 
taots. TherÂ« are few architectural Monuments of modern date, and the manner of ttuilding is 
not distingiiisbed for convenience or elegance. But the ruins of the ancient cities are imposing 
â€¢â–  and grand, especially those of Per- 

sepolis. Next to the pyramids of 
Sgypt and -the colossal ruins of 
Thebes, they have arrested the 
greatest attention, and like them 
they still remain an enigma, their 
history, dates, and object being in- 
volved in the gloom of antiquity. 
The royal palace, or the Takh-te- 
Juvuhted, consists of a number 
of superb buildings, forming both, 
a palace of ample magnitude, aod 
a citadel or bulwark for the capi- 
tal, on a situation of the most com' 
manding aspect. It consists of an 
artificial platform, 1,436 feet long 
R^^r^^pMM. by 802 broad, on the south, and' 

926 feet on the north side, chis- 
ded ont of a mountain, and having a higher part of the same mountain connected with its east- 
em ude, the other three sides presenting perpendicular precipices from tlie subjacent plain. On 
the mountains to the east, called by Diodorus the royal mount, and which still preserves the 
name Shah-koh^ or royal mount, are thejombs of the kings, excavated in the rock. The only 
^nj (o the summit is by an ascent of steps on the western face, forming a double flight. The 
(taps are broad and shallow, 10, and sometimes 14, being cut out of one block of marble. 8o 
easy is the ascent, that 6 horsemen may ride abreast to the top of the platform. Niebuhr de- 
dares (his staircase to be the most splendid, sublime, and durable ever reared by human hands, 
niaoy of tbe stones being 27 feet long, and many on the wall 55 feet long by from 4 to â‚¬ feet 
high. On reaching the platform, the first objects that meet tbe eye are S colossal bulls, of a 
noble form and attitude, sculptured on tbe lofty sides of an enormous portal. Other symbolical 
representations in granite, in basso-relievo, are found in different places. On a near approach 
to the hall of columns, the eye is riveted by the grandeur and beautiful decorations of the double 
â– taircase, which leads up to them. Beyond this, and rising from the landing-place, is another 
double staircase, but smaller ; tbe windings of these staircases are covered with sculptures of 
human figures, and a duplicate representation of a combat between a hull and a lion. What 
artist sculptured the wonderful procession on tbe winding walls of the staircase is unknown, but 
it seems to be of Ionian workmanship. At any rate, the finishing of the parts, and the grace 
and truth of the bass-reliefs, proclaim a re6nement worthy of the master chiseb of Greece. As 
for the platform itself, nothing can be more striking than the view of its ruins ; so vast, so mag- 
â–¡iScent, so fallen, so mutilated, and silent. But every object is as desolate as it is beautiful; 
awakening the most poignant feelings, that a pile of such indefatigable labor, such complicated 
ingenuity, should be left untenanted end unnoticed in the desert, or if noticed, be doomed to 
tbe predatory mallet of some ruthless bigot or ignorant barbarian. This immense pile is 380 
feet long from east to west, and 350 from north to south ; the greater part of which space is 
covered with broken capitals, shafts of pillars, and countless fragments of buildings, some of 
which are ornamented with the most exquisite sculptures.

CHAPTER LXV, CABULISTAN, OR AFGHANISTAN. 

1. Boumdariei and ExUnU Afghanistan, or the kingdom of Cabu], is bounded oo the H. 
by Herat and Turkistan ; on the L. by the land of the Seiks, in Hindostan ; on the S. by 
tfeloocbistao ; and on the W. by Persia. It extends from lat. 28^ to 36^ N., and from long. 
S9^ to 72^ Â£., having an area of 146,000 square miles, and a population of 4,200,000 souk. 

2. MowUaim. Rivers, The country is an elevated table-land, from 4,000 to 6,000 ' 
high ; above this rise the summits of the Hindoo-Koo Mountains^ which traverse the kiDgdom 
mm east to west, reaching an elevation of above 20,000 feet ; a chain branches off to thesoutb, 
near Cabul, and is known under the name of the Soliman Mountains^ extending in two parailel 
ranges into Beloochistan. The principal river is the Helmendj which runs mto Lake Zemh. 

3. ProdueHons. Although much of the country consists of hieh, bleak hills, unfitted for 
tillage, and the southwestern part is a vast desert, there are many fertile valleys and warm 
plains, which are populous, productive, and well cultivated. The mhabitants are chiefly wan- 
dering shepherds. Few lodian plants iohabit Cabulistan, but those of Europe are in greit 
abuadaDce there. The vine, the peach, and apricot grow wild, and seem to be indigenoas. 
The prevailing trees on the mountains are various species of pine, one of which bears cooes 
as large as artichokes, and seeds as big as pistachio nuts. There are likewise cedars, a gi^ 
tie cypress, and several kinds of oak, with the wabut, pistachio, and terebinth. Oki the or 
oidtivated plains, the most common trees are the mulberry, the tamarind, the plane, the pophr, 
ami several sorts of willow. Fruits and com are produced in the eastern part, and in tbe low, 
hot districts of the East, sugar, ginger, cotton, dates, millet, &c., are raised. Among the 
most valnaUa and remarkable productions of the eastern parts of the country is the assaftetidt 
plant ; its stem is from one to two and a half feet high, and when ripe it produces a caulifl(mc^ 
Uke bead. The milky juice extracted near the root }rields the well-known gum.' Tbe natifes 
stew or roast the stem, and boil or fry the head and leaves with ghtej or clarified hotter, 
and in this way the smell is even stronger than that of the drug, tfid no one but those accustooed 
to it can bear its offensive effluvia. Lead, iron, and salt are abundant. 

At Cabul, where the summers are not so hot, and the winters, without being severe, are 
colder, and accompanied with frequent falls of snow, tbe fruit-trees of Hindostan are not s^ 
while those of Elurope abound, lo general the climate mnst be regarded as too cold for tropbl 
productions. 

4. DUmuMM. The kbgdom is composed of two great regions, â€” Afghanistan, which is <Â£â€¢ 
vided into 7 provinces, and Sistan, or Segistan. 

6. Totm$. CtUnd^ the capital, is situated in a fertile and well*watered plain, cdebraled ibr 
its fine climate. The town is well built, but the houses are mostly of wood. Here is a citadel 
built upon a low hill, and containing a magnificent royal palace ; the bazars are also vast huiU* 
ings, and the commerce, till the recent civil wars, was extensive. The population, which was 
60,000, is probably likewise diminished by the troubles which have distracted the countiy. 

Ohiznehy or Oazna^ once the capital of an empire reaching from the Tigris to the Ganges, 
is now fallen into decline, and its magnificent baths, rich palaces, superb mosques, and nuiueroos 
bazars, have disappeared. It now contains about 8,000 inhabitants. 

Oandahar^ a fortified place in a fertile and highly cultivated plain, is a large and popukns 
city, with about 100,000 inhabitants. It is regidarly laid out and well built, and is the centre 
of an active trade. It contains a royal palace, and in the centre of the city is the fhar$kee^ i 
vast rotundti, surroimded with shops, to which all the principal streets converge. Candaharbs 
lately been occupied by the English. Pea^i^er, the capital of the kingdom of Cabul werioQS 
to its late dismemberment, stands m a fertile plain, bounded by the loftiest ranges of the tiwic<^ 
Koo and Soliman mountains. The city is rudely built, and the few good edifices are mucB 
decayed ; tbe number of its population is also much reduced, in consequence of the late re^o* 
kitions in the country ; but it presents a picturesque aspect, and a motley population of loite 
Persians, Tartars, &4). 

Segistan contains only small towns, and consbts principally of a great desert. 

4. Inhahitanti. Tbe population consists chiefly of A%hans, a race nearly allied to tbe ?f^ 



iians. In the towns Hre many Persittis tad IMian^> Ae A%hati9 ne^er ^xeranng a trtii 
The latter occupy themselves with war, robbery, huMiag, aftd raiaiM berdt. They are ruda. 
Tindictive, and rapacious, but fatdiful, hosptlabie, laboHoos, open, and brave. Tbeh* refigimi is 
Mahometanism, but they are not bigoted* The language nearly resembles the Persian, and 
the educated Afghans are familiar with Persian literatiÂ»re. Educaition is carefidly provided tor 
among them, every village having its school, which is attended by afanost every boy. 

The usual dress is a sort of frock, reaching below the knee, and loose, dark cotton trowsers ; 
the head is covered with a low, flat cap of black silk, and the feet with half-boots^ lac^ m front. 
The houses of the rich are surrounded by high walls, inclosing courts and gardens, and they are 
provided with cari^ets, some glass windows, &c. Those of uie lower class, consist of a single 
room, without chairs or tables, their place being supplied by carpets and felt cushions. Tne 
pastoral tribes live in coarse, woolen tents. 

The Afghans are fond of all sorts of boisterous amusements, particularlv those which invdve 
great display of bodily activity. Hunting is, as it were, the rage over all Afghanistan, and the 
people pursue it not only in aU the known and usud modes, but in others peculiar to xbe country 
Itself. Sometimes a wliole neighborhood assembled forms a circle, and sweeps together Wttb- 
hi it all the game belonging to a certain district. In the villages nuich delight is ^en m the 
atium^ a hearty and noisy dance, consisting in violent movements, in which both sexes join. 
They deHght in the fighting of quaik, cocks, and other animals ; and they amuse themselves at 
marbles, hopping on one foot, and other games considered with us as suited only to children. 

Although the Afghans are a sober and temperate people, they are enabled to Hve weU, by 
the extreme cheapness of all provisions, particularly fruit and vegetables. They are also social 
and hospitable ; and even the poorer classes, when they can afford to kill a sheep, invite their 
neighbors to partake. The dishes are merely the mutton with the broth in which it has been 
boiled y the drink is buttermilk or sherbet ; and conviviality is chiefly promoted by the use of 
tobacco. At the tables of the great, rich pikus and dishes variously dressed, Â«te presented on 
trays, after the Persian manner, and ornamented with gold and silver leaf. The Afghans taSs, a 
good deal at table, usually in a somewhat grave style, though not without occasional sallies of 
mirth. One of their favorite amusements consists in walks and collations in the numerous 
gardens that surround their cities, particularly Cabal, the views from which are particularly beatK 
dful. 

The whole nation of Afghans, like the ancient kingdom o( Israel, is divided into tribes, 
which continue much unmixed, each under its own peculiar government, with little interference 
from the royal government. The king is, in fact, merely the khan of the Dooraunees, the 
ruling tribe, as being that of Ahmed Shah, the founder of the empire, and his powers ovor the 
other tribes, are confined to nominating their khans, levjring troops, and oollectmg die revenue. 
The Ghiljies, a proud, fierce, and warlike tribe, are the rivals of the Dooraunies, and siitenit 
with impatience to their supremacy. The Berdooraunies, Eusofzies, Sheraunees, Viiierees, 
are among the principal tribes. The internal government of the tribes is republican ; they are 
divided into separate clans, and each clan has its chief or khan, chosen from the oldest femily. 
The khans generally act in council with the heads of families. The people are much Macb- 
ed to their respective tribes, though but little to the khans, and their republican spirit haspre- 
served them from the general debasement in the East, caused by the oriental despotisms. When 
an English traveler had expatiated on the advantages of a firm and steady government, in the 
security it gives from alarm, discords, asd bloodshed, the Afghans replied, ^^ We are content 
with discord, we are content with alarms, we hxe content with bk)od, but we shaH never be 
content with a master." 

7. Hisiory. This region, under the names of Arachosia, Paropamisus, and Drangiana, 
was looked upon by the ancients as a rude and barbarous tract, but in modem times it has re- 
peatedly played an important part in history. In the 11th century Mahmoud, of Ghitni, inaiie 
that city the capital of an empire, which extended from the Indus to the Euphrates ; but his 
dynasty was crushed by the conquests of Timor, and Cabal became the capital of die great 
Mogid empire, under some of his successors. In the close of the 17th century the Afghans 
conquered Persia ; Nadir Skah, however, not only drove them out of that coimtrv, but sub- 
dued them in turn. On his death, Ahmed Shah in the middle of &e last eentory , ^eKvareJ bis 
country from the Persian yoke, and conquered some of the finest provinces of Western India, 
including Lahore, Mouiian, and Cashmere, to which was also added Balkh. Since bis deadi 
jotemal dissensions have broken die power of this great empire ; the wattike ttkl able iUiijeec

khaos.of Baikh and BeloochistaOi and the princes of Sindb took this opportunity tosecus Â» 
their independence, and one bnmch of the royal family erected an independent throoe at 
Herat. The English lately occupied Aighanbtan, deposed the king, and gave the crowo to i 
creature of their own. But the Afghans rose, destroyed one of the occupying armies and 
drove the English frona the country. 

CHAPTER LXVI. KINGDOM OF HERAT. 

1. Boundaries. The kingdom of Herat is bounded north by Turkistan ; south and eastb? 
CabuU and west by Persia. It lies between 33^ and 36^ N. lat. and 60Â° and 67Â° E. long', 
having an area of 66,000 square miles, and a population of 1,500,000. It is an elevated ta? 
ble-land, intersected by lofty mountabs, and mhabited by Afghans, and some tribes of Tiu^ 
comans. 

3. Towns. Herat J the capital, is a large and strongly fortified town, situated in a populous 
and highly cultivated valley. It is the centre of a great commerce, and its manufactures are 
numerous and flourishing ; the celebrated Khorasan sabres are made here. Popukdoo, 
100,000. Bamiam, a small city, is chiefly remarkable for the immense number of excava- 
tions in the rocks in its vicinity ; they are said to amount to 12,000 ; here are also 2 colosd 
statues, 50 cubits high. The people, and their manners, customs, and condition, do not difer 
from those of Afghanistan, from which Herat is only recently and politically detached. 



CHAPTER LXVIL BELOOCHISTAN. 

1. Boundaries^ &c. This country, which is occupied by confederated tribes of Beloochis^ 
is bounded north by Cabul and Persia ; east by the country of the Seiks and Sindh ; south bj 
the Arabian Sea, and west by Persia. It lies between lat. 25^ and 30^ N., and between long. 
58^ and 69^ E., having an area of 140,000 square miles, and 2,000,000 inhabitants. Itb 

"^rarersed by the Soliman Mountains, and a considerable part ef the country is a vast desert. 
The rivers are small, and mostly dry up in the hot seasons. 

2. Divisions and Towns. The ISeloochis resemble the Afghans in their mode of lifeiand 
Aere are few considerable towns. The several tribes of the confederacy are governed by thek 
own cbieCs or serdars^ hut they recoenise the supremacy of the serdar of Kelah Â£eM, i 
town of about 20,000 inhabitants, is situated upon a high table-land, in a well cultivated dis* 
trict ; the climate, owing to the elevation, is cold. It has some commerce, and its bazan. are 
large. Oundava is the residence of the serdar in winter ; it has about 16,000 iiihabitantSi iod 
b well built. ^; 

This country, the Gedrosia of the ancients, is often described under the name of MaMat 
as a province of Persia ; but it has no connexion with that State, and besides Mekran, k in- 
cludes Cutch, Gundava, Lus, Sarwan, Jhalawan, and other districts. 

3. Inhabitants. The inhabitants of these provinces are, with few exceptions, wandering in 
their habits of life, there being few towns or even considerable villages. The Beloochb and 
the Brahooes, as far as is known, constitute the bulk of the population. The Beloocbis are 
.brave, hospitable, honorable robbers, esteeming theft disgraceful, but making chepaos or preda- 
tory elicursions to a great distance to burn villages, carry off slaves, and plunder. Their man- 
ners are pastoral ; they live in ghedstns or tents, made of black felt or coarse blankets, stretch- 
ed over a francie of wickcy-work. Like other pastoral nations, they are indolent and food o( 
hvniing ; unless occupied by some favorite amusement, they will spend whole days in lounging 
from one ghedan to another, smoking and gambling. They have commonly two wives, and 
sometimes more. They treat theur women with attention and respect, and are not so scmpa- 
lous about thâ‚¬^ being seen as most Mahometans. Their language nearly resembles the modem 
Persian, and is of kindred origin. The Beloochis are Sunnites. 

Living with them, but quite distinct from them in most points, are the Brahooes, who are 
mild, inofiensive, quiet, and industrious ; not less hospitable, nor less faithful in adhering to 
their promises, but less addicted to revenge, cruelty, and avarice. They are, perhaps, the abo- 
rigines ; they lead a pastoral life, roaming from . one part of the country to another, according 
o the semoai and also changing their places of abode in quest o * pasturage. Some of tbem

^tod carpets, the prodace of their industry. The tasks of the family are divided among riw 
members, much in the European manner. The men tend the flocks, and. till the ground ; 
the women milk the herds, make butter, cheese, felt, and coarse cloths. The language of the 
Brahooes is different from that of the Beloochis, and seems to resemble some of the Indian dla* 
lects. The western part of Mekran is infested by banditti, called Loories, of a much baser 
character than the usual predatory hordes of Asia. They have renounced every religious be- 
lief, and, maintaining that men are born to eat, and sleep, and die, and be forgotten, they aban- 
don themselves without scruple to every species of profligacy and depravity. 

The govemmenl of Kelat is despotic, but limited by a feudal system. The serdars, or 
chiefs of the tribes are bound to furnish their quoU of troops, and to attend the court. They 
are partly heredilary and partly chosen by the tribes themselves, and their authority is limited. 

CHAPTER LXVIIl INDIA, OR HINDOSTAN. 



1. Boundariei. This great region is bounded 00 the N. by jhe Chinese empire; on the E. 
by the Binnan empire and the Bay of Bengal ; S. by the Indian Ocean ; and W. by the Ara- 
bian 8ea, Cabul, and BeloochisUn. It extends from 8Â° to 34Â° N. lat., and from 67Â° to 9ttÂ° 
E. long., being 1,500 miles in its greatest breadth, and 1,800 railj^ in length /rom north to 
south. Its area, which exceeds 1,400,000 square miles, is more than one third that of all Eu- 
rope, and it contains 140,000,000 inhabitants. 

3. Jlfoitntain$. The Himala Momttaitu, nbich extend along its whole northern boundary, 
contain the loftiest summits in the world. They rise in successive stages from tlie chan^iai^ 
country, forming several pflrsllel ridges, until the principal and lofriest range shoots its co- 
lossal summits up into regions of perpetual snow. This principal chain separates the val- 
leys of Berinagore, Nepaul, and Bootan, from Tibet, and attains an elevation of 26,000 
and 28,000 feet. The Chamoalari, on the frontiers of Bootan, is the highest known 
mountain in the world, being 38,200 feet in height ; the Dhaiealagiriy on the frontiers of Ne 
paul is but little inferior in devation. A lower and pataUd cham runs along the sootiieni laar

3. jRirer*. Tbe Gangti, tbe principal lirer of India, rises os ths soutfaem dscUTitj of lie 
northern or principal chain of the Himala Mountains, and lAer a cowse of 800 miles, inqei 
from the tower range of mountains into tbe open countrr- Hence this great river, nbidi tlie 
Hindoos bold in religious reneration, bellertng that its waters have a virtue which wtU perif; Ibcnt 
from every transgression, flows through deli^rtful plains, with a soMOth, mvigible stremfanl 
to 3 miles wide, toward the Bay of Bengal, into which it runs by 2 lai^, and a multitude of stoDct 
channels, that form and intersect 8 large, triangular island, the base of which, at the sea, is neat 
300 miles in extent. The whole navigable course of this river, from its entrance mto tbe i^ to 
the sea, extending with its windings above 1,300 miles, is now possessed hy the Britisti, their 
allies, and tributaries. Tbe western branch, called the Little Ganges, or river of Ho^bf^ k 
navigable for lai^e ships. The Ganges receives II rivers, some of which are e<]ua]l>lhe 
Rhine, and none inferior to tbe Thames ; the principal tributary is tbe Jumna, which fail 
course of 800 miles. The inundations of the Ganges are watched with great interest by '^ffUgt 

ke place tn July and August, and are caused in part by tbe rains and melt'mg of MM| 
part of its course, and in part hy tbe rain which falls in tbe plain. By tbe MtiK 
lower parts of Bengal contiguous to the Ganges are overflowed, and fonn cH 
100 miles in breadth. The Brahmapootra or Bwrampootra is supposed t^B 
ins to the east of Assam, and it joins iIk eastern branch of the Ganges ; tbe Mipj| 
explored. â–  *â– . 

r or Sind rises on the northern declivity of the Himala Mountains, io Little Twt| 
Ing a northerly direction for a considerable distance, it breaks through tbe iBini- 
ws south into tbe Arabian Sea. Its length is 1 ,700 miles, and it discbai^^efiili 
ingle mouth, hut sends off a lai^ branch to the Gulf of Cutcb. Its priocipit tii- 
Pvnjab, formed by tbe confluence of 5 rivers, of which the StUkgey with a course 
, and jylum, 750 miles in lei^th, are the chief. In Southern Hindostan, ibe 
rs are thie JWrbwdda, which forma tbe northern boundary of the Deccan, and flows 
of Camhay, after a course of 750 miles ; tbe Godmerif which fises b the West- 
ern Ghauts, and runs into the Bay of Bengal, through a distance of 880 mitei ; and tbe Krii- 
tuty 700 miles m length, and Cavtry, 400, running into the same bay. 

4. Surfact, The oorthem part is mountainous and rugged ) but between tbe paraBd rUfft 
of tbe Himala Mountvns extends ibe beautitul girdle cj Bootad, Nepaul, Serinasore, and Cisb- 
mere, comprising a series of charming valleys and plains, at the height of from 4,000 to 7,000 
feel. The valley of the Ganges, comprising the main body of India, is composed of i pâ€” 
plain of matchless fertility, extending from the Brahmapootra to the great desert, which #^ 
the sources of the .Tumna from the tributaries of the Indus, and from the mountains of i'* 
to the high lands of central India ; it is 1,200 miles long, and from 300 to 400 broad, aol 
a continuous level of exhaustless richness, over which majestic rivers difiuse themselverill 
slow and almost insensible course. Westward of this plain, stretches the elevated (*"^ 
Ajmere, of moving sand, extending 600 miles from north to south, and 300 from eas~ 
and bearing in some parts coarse grass or prickly sluTibs, and mierspersed with some f 
tracts. West of this, isrfhe rich plain of tlie Punjab, in which the 5 tributaries of the I 
produce the luxuriant fertility of the Gaogetic plain. Around the Nerbudda is the ta 
of Central India, comprising Malwa, Candeisb, and Gundwana, having an elevation o 
IjSOO to 3,000 feet. Further south, lies the table-land of the Deccan, which is from I,jt. 
3,000 feel high. Below this, on the east and west, the coast sinks down to a Biti^ 
country. 

5. CHmate. The vaiying d^rees of elevation produce here the same cfaaoges in regatif 
temperature, that arise in some regions from great difierences of positioD upon the earth's tw 
face. The littoral plains and tbe high table-lands of the Deccan, tbe flat lands oi the Gui^< 
and the mountainous regions of tbe north, present striking contrasls. Tbe vast plains exhint 
the double harvests, tbe luxuriant fcJiage, aod even the burning deserts of tbe torrid mw ; ^

keftberaaM; and tbe vobeahby season, during tbe period of the rains, and a short tiioe after ibeir 
isrmfniina. Tbs nonbeast monsoon prevails durii^ one half of tbe rear, and tbe southwest dur- 
ing the other half. The monsoons are 
~ ~~ generally ushered in by forious storms, 

which deluge tbe country with rains, 
blow down tbe trees, and destroy tbe 
crops and bouses of tbe inhabitants. 
la tbe soutbem part of Hindosian, tbe 
mountains running from north to south, 
reader it winter on one side, while it is 
summer oo the other. About the end 
of June, B southwest wind begins to 
blow from tbe sea, on the coast of Ma- 
labar, which, with continual rain, lasts 
4 months, during which time all is so- 
rene upon tbe coast of Coramandel. 
Near tbe end of October, tbe rainy sea- 
son and the change of the monsoons be- 
gin on tbe latter coast ; and, as it is d^ 
stitute of secure harbors, ships are tbeU 
aMig te ^ JUmuoen. obliged to leave it. Tbe air m natural^

r^esbed by breetes, the wind altering every 13 hours ; that is, from midnight to noon it blowa 
off tbe land, when it is iat<derably bot ; and during the other 13 hours, from the sea, which 
proves a great refreshment to tbe inhabitants of the coast. 

6. Soil. The soil of this country is in many parts so excellent as to consist of black, vege- 
table mould to the depth of 6 feet. In Bengal, me Ganges annually overflons the coiHitry to 
Ibe extent of more than 100 miles in width, which inimdation greatly fertilizes the land, and the 
periodical rains and intense beat produce an extraordinary Iusuriai>ce of vegetation. 

7. Jfatural Productiotu, Large 
forests are found in various parts of 
this extensive country, and on the 
coast of Malabar, they consist of uees 
of a prodigious size. Tbe teak tree 
{T*â‚¬tvria grondU) affords a strong 
and durable timber, which is well cal- 
culated for ship-building, as teak-ships 
that have been in service for 30 years 
are not uncommon in the Indian seas, 
while a European built ship is ruined 
there in ft years. Tbe cocoa tree

ooe of which will sometimes shade 12 men, is the Palmyra pahn (AÂ»'aÂ«nrtjw6<Ui/onPH*),Â«lDcfa 
sometimes reaches the height of 100 feet. Another species of palm (Sagiu farinifsra), yiddi 
the 6^0, much used for puddings. The hetel {Artcha catechu) is cultivated all over laii 
for its fruit, the well known betel-nut. The Indian % {Ficui religiota)^ likewise called tin 
banyao and the wonder-tree, is sometimes of an amasing size, as it is continually iocreisiif ; 
every branch proceeding from the trunk throws out long fibres, which take root in the eaith, 
and shoot but new branches ; these again throw out fibres that take root, and continue to in- 
crease as loog as they find soil to nourish them. Of fruil-beariug trees the number is very grot, 
and the fruit delicious, especially pomegranates, oranges, lemons, citrons, dates, almmids, ob- 
goes, pines, melons ; and, in the northern parts, pears and apples. In some parts, large tnco 
are covered with a dense mass of foliage and vegetation, crowded and twined together ia sodi 
a manner as to be dmost impenetrable. This forms wMt is called a jungle, composed ofh^ 
trees, prickly shrubs, and canes or bamboos, which in a few months run up to the height of 100 
feet. Not less gigantic as a grass, than the banyan as a tree, is the bamboo (Anmdo bambot), 
whose light and jointed stems often exceed 100 feet in height. The wood is extremely dun- 
ble, and is used for various purposes. The colion-iree {Goetypium htrbaceum), sugip<ise 
{Saccharinmn officinantm), and indigo plant {Indigofera tinctoria), are natives of Indii,iiil 
are extensively cultivated. Cajeput oil is the produce of an East India shrub (J tfifa lii n 
Uucadendron), and caoutchouc, or Indian rubber, is the inspissated juice, not onlyofseim 
species of fig, but also of the gum elastic vine {Urceola eUutica). Ginseng (Paiuuf^ 
UHg), which is highly prized in Cbma, belongs to the same genus with the wild ginseng of (Ids 
country, which is also exported to China. Sandal wood {Santalum allnim)y is a well knoim 
(ragraat wood, much used for ornamental and religious purposes by the Hindoos. Tbe injc 
spikenard, or Indian nard (Foferuma jatamauri), has been employed as a perfume from ibe 
remotest antiquity. 

7. ^nimou. Of the wild animals of Hindostan, the tiger, for his size and strength, rnij 
claim tbe first place ; tbe royal tiger (as be is called) of Bengal grows, it is said, to the hei^ 
of 4 or 3 feet, with a proportionel length, and has such strength, that be can carry off a ktf- 
k>ck or a buffalo with ease. Elephants are here very numerous and large. Here are also rhiaD-

eeroses, wild-boars, lions, bears, leopards, panthers, lyxes, hyenas, wolves, jackals, and foie!, 
with various species of apes and monkeys, and many beautiful antelopes, pardcularly that Iv^ 
kind called the nyl-ghau. Wild buffaloes, which are very fierce, and have horns of eitiw* 
oary length, and the yak or grunting ox, are also numerous. 

8. Jlfinemb. Iron, copper, and lead are abundant in various regions, but the mines ire b* 
t)e wrought. The soil In many places b impregnated with saltpetre and soda, which is de)Wâ– ^ 
ed upon the surface in moist weather in great quantities. Borax or tincal is obtained by ev^ 
ration from many saline lakes. Diamonds are obtamed by washings In several localities upon the 
Krishna, and the Godavery, and m Bundelcund ; there are no minea in Golcouda, but lbs dii- 
monds are cut in the city of that name, which is a great mart for this gem, and this has M >o

found in the narrow crevices of tbe rocks, loose, and never adherent to the strong stratum. 
The miners, with long iron rods, which iuve boolcs at tbe ends, pick out the contents of tbe 
fissures, and wash them in tubs ia order to discover the diamonds. In Color they dig in a large 
plain to the depth of 10 or 14 feet ; 40,000 persons are employed, the men to dig, and the 
women and childrea to carry the earth to the places in which it is to be deposited before tbe 
search is made. Diamonds are also found in the gravel or sand of rivers, washed out of their 
beds, and carried down with the stream. The river Gonel, near Sumbulpour, is tbe most 
irated for them. 

9. hlands. Ceylon lies near the southern extremity of Hindostan. - It is 300 miles ia 
length, and from SO to 100 in breadth. Tbe coast is low and flat, and encircled with a wide 
border of cocoa trees, surrounded by rocks and shoals. The interior is filled with mountains, 
which rise in successive ranges from the coast ; many of them are verdant and beautiful ; others, 
peaked and rooky ; tbe highest b caUed Adam's Peak. A chain of shoals and rocks, called 

Adam's bridge, connects tbe island with die ccm- 
^nent, so that the channel between them is impas- 
sable for ships. Ceylon produces a great varietr 
of fruits, and the finest cinnamon in the world. 
Tbe minerals are tin, lead, iron, and quicksilver. 
Precious stones are abundant, including the ruby, 
topaz, amethyst, and diamond, though the last are 
not of fine quahty. An extensive pearl-fishery is 
carried on in tbe Straits of Manaar, chiefly by 
boats from the mainland of India. Columbo is the 
chief town, aod has considerable commerce, with 
- â–  J.. gf ctj~. " population of 50,000. Trincomalee derives im- 

'â– 'V**- portance from the excellence of its harbor, in 

which the English have a dock-yard. The natives are divided into the Cingalese, who inhabit 
tbe maritime region, and tbe Candians, who live in the interior. Tbe island belongs to the Eng- 
iub crown. 

Tbe Laccadiett are a group of shoals and islets to the west of tbe Deccan , they are gov- 
erned by a prbce, dependent upon tbe English. The Jtlaldivu abo consist of a great number 
of banks or holms, among which there are 40 or 50 inhabited islets.* The sovereign, who bears 
tbe Utle of sultan, resides In tbe largest, which is about 3 miles in circumference. 

10. VicUioiii. Tliis country is politically divided into Briiisb India, French India, Potti^ 
guese India, native kingdotns, dependent on, or in alliance with tbe British, of which tbe princi- 
pal are Sindia and Nepaul, and tbe kingdom of the Maldives. The following tabic gives llie 
general view of these divisions.

IJ. Briluh hidia. The English E^st India company are masters of neariy all India, which 
dwjr bavs conquered from the native princes. Their territories cover an area of 1,200,000 
lyai IJ miles, and contain a population of 130,000,000 souls. They are composed of two dis- 
tinct parts ; the country immeaiately and entirely governed by the company's servants, divided 
into ibe three presidencies of Bengal, Madras, and Bombay, having an area of 600,000 square 
nies, and 90,000,000 inhabitants; and tbe territory of the allied States, wliich are garrisoned 
by Bniish troops and are really mere vassals of the company, though nominally governed by 
ibflir own princes ; the vassal or allied States are, Hyderabad, Nagpore, Oude, Satarah, Mysore,

Calcutta^ the capital of Bengal, stands upon the Hoogljr, in a marsfajr and tmbealtfay spot 
It consists of two parts ; the one inhabited by the natives, dirty and meanly built, called tbi 
Black Town, is a mere assemblage of thatched mud huts ; the other, occupied by the Euro- 
peans, called the Chouringee, is described as resembling a village of palaces. Calcutta is the 
residence of the goyemor-general of India, and is one of the most wealthy, populous, ud 
commercial cities of Asia, having about 600,000 inhabitants. Fort William, at Calcutta, b 
remarkable for the vast extent and great strength of its works. Serampore, in the vicimtj, be* 
longs to Denmark ; it is a small town with 13,000 inhabitants, and is chiefly remarkable, as 
being the principal station of the Baptist missionaries in India ; they have here a coll^ for 
the instruction of native youth, and a celebrated printing establishment, from which have issued 
translations of the Bible into eight Indian languages, and of the New Testament into 24 lo* 
dian dialects. Dacca^ upon the branch of the Ganges called die Old Ganges, was once the 
capital of Bengal, and ' is famous for the beautiful products of its looms, particulariy its fine 
muslins. It has 200,000 inhabitants. Mooshedabady upon the Ganges, with it 90,000 iobabi* 
tants, and Patna, upon the same river, with 300,000, are, like most of the Asiatic cities, 
meanly built, but their manufactures are important. 

Benaresj higher up the Gauges, is the largest city of India, and has long been celebrated 
as the chief seat of maminical learning ; it is also venerated by the Hindoos as a holy pbce, 
and crowds of pilgrims annually visit it from all parts of the country. The houses are h\^ 
and are ornamented with verandahs and galleries, and covered with painted tiles of brilliant 
colors. The temples are generally small, but they are numerous, and covered with sculptures 
of high finish. Sacred bulls, consecrated to Siva, the Destroyer, the third member of tbe 
Hindoo trinity, are seen strolling about the streets, and groups of monkeys, sacred to 
numan, or the Man Monkey, are climbing over the temples, or pillaging the shops, \ 
Out check, of fruits and sweetmeats. Benares is also a great manufacturing city, awt 
great mart for the shawls of the north, the diamonds of the south, the musHns of 
and the English manufactures, brought from Calcutta. Allahabad, at the confluence 
Jumna with the Ganges, is regarded by' the Hindoos as the queen of holy cities, and 
nually visited by thousands of pilgrims ; the prayagas^ or points where the tributaries ^ 
Ganges join the maip stream, being regarded as places of peculiar sanctity, ablution io wlucb 
atones even for deadly sins. It is now much reduced, having but 20,000 inhabitants, but its 
citadel, which has been rendered impregnable by the English, renders it the principal strong- 
hold of British India. 

*Sgraj on the Jumna, once the splendid residence of the Great Mogul Akbar, is now prioci* 
pally in ruins. It still contains 60,000 inhabitants, and has of late begun to recover its com- 
merce. The most remarkable building is the mausoleum of Tajmafaal, erected by her husband; 
it is built of marble, and forms a square of 670 feet, surmounted by a marble dome70ftÂ« 
high, and 4 minarets of great elegance ; the walls are adorned with exquisite o^osaics, made a 
precious stones, and a beautiful and spacious garden surrounds the buildiDg. The nmaack^ 
of Akbar, 'at Sicandara, 6 miles distant, is little inferior to this. 

Delhi^ also upon the Jumna, and at one trnife the residence of the brilliant court of die GriM 
Mogul, is now much reduced, but still contains 300,000 inhabitants. The imperial pthoe is 
one of the most magnificent residences in the world ; it is surrounded by a high and strong w 
of about a mile in circuit. The principal mosque, considered tbe most splendid Haboflwtn 
temple in India, rises upon a vast platform surrounded with a beautiful colonnade, and is 3(XI 
feet long ; its rich decorations, its domes, and lofty minarets, ISO feet m height, are moch ad*

triis to Delhi, for purpoBes of irrigatioo. Hardviar is famous for its situation at the confluence 
of tbe two bead tHancnes of the Ganges, ^ich attracts ao immense number of pilgrims, esdÂ« 
Biaeed M sonie seasons to exceed 1,000,000. 

^i^trnaut, in CMssa, is renowned throughout all India for its temple, esteemed by the na- 
tives the most sacred place of pilgrimage. It consists of a number of buildings, surrounded 
b^ Â« high wall, within which is a second enclosure, containing the sanctuarj of Juggernaut, 
tha Im^ of Ae nurerse, a pytamidal building 200 feet high. At great festivals, tbe Ju^emaiil 
is placed in an enormous car, and dragged to his country residence, whence, aAer spending 8 
days, be is conducted back to the temple. It is at this time, that the wretched devotees throw 
tbemsdves onder the wheels of the car, esteeming it a passport to happiness in the next world 
to be crushed under its weight. 

JKsdrai, the capitri of the presidency of the same name, is a large, populous, and well-built 
cirf, with 462,000 inhabitants. It presents a singular mixture of pagodas, minarets, mosques, 
â– ad gardens, and consisu of 3 distinct quarters, the Black and the White Town. Its cotton 
aaiKActures are exteiarre, and its commerce considerable. In the vicinity are the celebrated 
ruaw of JfaAa&alJpttrani, consisting of immense excavations, groups of innumerable figures of 
man Mid animab ; and beneath the waters of tbe sea,, which has swallowed up a part of its site, 
aome buildings are still visiUe. 

TWe&inopoly, one of the chief military stations of the British, contains 80,000 inhabitants, 
and Tanjore, in the neighborhood, once the capital of a kingdom, has about 30,000 inhabitants. 
On tbe aland of 8eriÂ»ghiimy in the Cavery opposite Triclunopoly, is an immense pagoda, 
OOBDpfMed of 7 enclosures, the walls of which are 25 feet high, each containing 4 large gates, 
atsmounted by towers ; ibe exterior wall is 4 miles in circuit ; the towers, gates, and interior 
of ihe buildings are covered with sculpture, and the canopy of the interior temple is of massive 
gold, set with precious stones. MasuHpatam, on the Krishna, with 75,000 inhabitants, ba5 
riw best harbor on tbe Coromandel coast, and its manufactures and commerce are extensive. 
SÂ«Hngapa(am, on the Cavery, m the kingdom of Mysore' belongs to the English ; it was once 

tbe residence of the celebrated Tippoo 
Saib, and the capital of a powerful king- 
dom, but it is now much reduced, and its 
1 50,000 inhabitants have dwindled down 
to 10,000. 

Bombay, the capital of a presidency, 
is built upon a small island, defended by 
a vast citadel, and is the chief naval sta" 
tiod of tbe English in India. Its harbor 
b tha best on the western coast, and Bom- 
bay is the great mart of the Indian trade

60,000 inhabitants. The royal palace is built to represent a peacock's tall, the colored jia 
of the windows representing uie nch spots of the plumes. Oodipoor or Odeypoor has isplw-

temple served by 500 priests. Cashnurej capital of the province of the same name, is a 
manufacturing city, but badly built, and much reduced from its former splendor. It is 
oefebrated for the beauty of its situation and its delightful climate, and it was the simmier resi- 
denoe of the former sovereigns of India. Its shawls are known all over the world. Popula- 
tkM, 100,000. 

i4Â» Kingdom ofMpaul. This State, which lies between British India and the Chinese 
empire, has an area of 53,000 square miles, and 2,500,000 inhabitants. CatmandoOj the capi- 
tal, has a population of about 20,000. 

to. Bootan. Bootan, or the country of the Debraja, is a lofty valley, lying between the lofti- 
est ^eeps of the Himala on the north, and a lower, but still elevated mountain range on the south, 
and extending from Nepaul on the west, to Assam on the east. Although it properly belongs, 
therefore, to Hindostan, in a physical pomt of view, yet it is politically connected with China, 
being one of the vassal or protected States of that vast empire. Even the deepest valleys are 
here from 3,000 to 6,000 feet above the sea, and the climate partakes of both extremes of heat 
and cold. The inhabitants are called BooteaSy and are either a distinct race, or related to the 
Mongols. They are Buddhists, and they consider their spiritual head, or Dherroa Raja, as the 
incarnation of the Deity. The number of gylongs or priests is great. The temporal sovereign 
is called Debraja ; there are no towns here, but the summer residence of the pnnce is Tassi- 
sudofij and his winter residence, Panuka. Both polygamy and polyandry are said to be com- 
mon in Bootan. 

16. The Principality of Sinde^ lying upon both sides of the Indus, has 1,000,000 inhabi- 
tants upon a surface of 52,000 square miles. The capital, Hydtrahad^ is noted for its manu* 
&ctiire of arms. Sinde has lately been taken posession of by the English. 

17. Portuguese India, The Portuguese possess only a small territory around Croa, Daman, 
and Diu, on the eastern coast. The town of Ooa^ on a small island, has a good harbor, and 
carries on an active trade ; its population is about 1 5,000, 

18. French India. France possesses several detached fragments of territory round Pondi- 
cbenry, Carical, Yanaon, Chandemagor, and Mahe, Pondicherry^ the residence of the governor 
of the French possessions in India, has 40,000 inhabitants. 

19. Danish India consists merely of Serampore^ in Bengal, and Tranquebar^ on the Ca- 
Teiy, in Tanjore, with 12,000 mhabitants. 

20. Agriculture. The implements of husbandly are exceedingly imperfect, and the agricul 
tural part of the population are extremely poor. The only artificial means of fertility employed 
to much extent is irrigation. Rice, which in Hindostan is the staff of life ; cotton of an inferior 
quality, the material of clothing ; opium, which is extensively used, particularly in the East, as 
a luxury ; silk, though inferior in staple to the European ; sugar, but of a sort inferior to that 
of the West Indies ; indigo, now the most important commercial product of India, and pepper, 
are the principal articles of agricultural industry.* 

2 1 . Manufactures. India long supplied the West with manufactured goods ; but, in most 
articles, European skill and machinery have in recent times supplanted the productions of India ; 
yet the muslins of Dacca, in fineness, and the calicoes and other piece-goods of Coromandel, 
in brilltancy and durableness of color, have never been surpassed. The Indian manufactures are 
produced by solitary individuals, working entirely by hand, with a loom of the rudest construe- 
cioa. The silk manufacture has been carried on from remote antiquity ; cotton goods have 
loog been made in great quantities, but at present British and even American cottons are impoit*

** IThe fict of fineqaent and inconceiyabbr dreadful fa- 
ntnes tbronghont the British territories or India, is one 
thfel bam been little known, and stiU less inquired into, by 
tbe people of this countrj. Few, comparativelj (for ex- 
aapley, are aware of the extent of the mortality amongst 
oar Indian fellow-sobjects in the npper provinces of Ben- 
fsly doting the past year. In a few abort months, more 
thmm half a milhon perished by famine, and the diseases 
produced by that calamity. At this moment, other parts 
â€¢f India are subjected to a similar Tisitation. Yet, down 
lo tfae preaeBt time, there has been no puhlic investigation 
lalo the eautea of tlwse (Hghtfnl events Their occorrenoe 



is here scarcely known. They have hitherto awakened, 
in Uiis conntry, no effect, no sympathv ; led to no relief. 
How far they are avoidable, how tar they can be averted, 
or their consequences mitigated, when they arrive, are 
questions yet to be asked. And shall not these questions 
be ai^ed, and a true and explicit answer be demanded ? 
Since 1770 (when a famine in Bengal swept off, it baa 
been computed, three millions), there has been a succes- 
sion of famines, which have destroyed the lives of im- 
mense muHitndes of human beings ; these human beincs 
have died in a country once deemed the wealthiest in the 
world, and upon one of the richest and most produotive 
â– oils upon the iaee of the globe."

i2. C0fMMrcâ‚¬, The Banians or Hindoo merchants, Armenians, and Parseee canjoiikg 
principal part of the internal trade ; the maritime commerce is principallj carried on bj b 
English, AmericanSi &c. The English East India Companjr prosecutes ao extensive cos- 
merce between India and China, and the Indian Islands ; tea is imported from China, to wlndi 
opium is sent ; spices from the Moluccas ; coffee from Arabia, &c* Until 1813, the East 
India Company had the monopoly of the British trade with India ; but the intercourse betm 
Great Britain and Hindostan was then made free to all British subjects, and in 1833, the o(lÂ» 
commercial privileges of the Conopany were abolished, and the functions of the Compmj km 
become merely administratiye. The commerce of India has always possessed an illusive^ 
dor in the eyes of Europeans, derived from the brilliant character of some of its articles. Bat 
it by no means ever possessed the magnitude or importance attached to it by some, lod its 
value has somewhat declined in modem times* The annual value of the exports of Bribiblfi- 
dia is about 55,000,000 dollars ; of imports, 40,000,000. 

23. Religion. The Hindoos are chiefly professors of Bramanism, but Buddhism b-Aere* 
ligion of the Cingalese, the Nepaulese, and some others. The Jains are a Buddhist li^ *lÂ» 
have incorporated somt notions derived from Bramanism with their faith. The Seiki |ifess 
the religion of Nanek, a mixture of Mahometanism with Bramanism. The Mahometaa n^ 
is professed by that race of conquerors who established the empire of the great Mogul, lodvbo 
were, m fact, a mixture of Persian and Turkish tribes, and by some Hindoo converts. Tk 
Parsees or Guebres are numerous in Guzerat, and there are souie Jdws aiid Christiaas. 

24. 6ot;emfiiâ‚¬ii^. The native princes, who reign over a considerable part of the cooatij, 
possess m general absolute power. The East India Company of merchants rules over tbe ifr 
mense territorial possessions belonging to it, without any other control than the respoosifailitT 
of its agents to the government of Great Britain. The government of the Company is v^ 
in a Court of Directors, under the supervision of the Board (^Control, wUch consists of sod^ 
of the chief ministers of the crown. The president of Bengal is styled Govemor-geQeniof 
India, and, with the other presidents, is appointed by the Directors. The laws aad Mgesof 
the Hindoos are generally respected within its possessions. The vassal princes or JSm b^c 
little more than the pomp of power, the real authority being, for the most part, m the haidlof tbe 
Company's residents or agents, stationed at the allied courts. The Company maintifaia hrp 
standing force of 256,000 men, consisting chiefly of native soldiers, called sepoys, but^^^ 
by Europeans ; only the inferior ranks being accessible to the natives. Garrisons are sdoooed 
in the allied territories, the troops composing which are paid by the respective princes. Titf 
English provinces are much more peaceful and prosperous than the States which still retain ther 
own princes ; and the best policy seems now to be, to consolidate the whole of India under ooe 
uniform government. 

25. InhabUants. The inhabitants of India are Hindoos, who compose the mass of the pope- 
ktion ; descendants of Tinrkishand Persian tribes, virbo at diflereat periods conquered die coqd- 
try ; Europeans, of whom the number is few, not probably amounting to 100,000, iDcludiof 
the civil and military servants of the Company, and the king's troops stationed in the country; 
the Anglo-Indians, or half castes, the descendants of English by Hindoo women, of wbon 
the number does not exceed 50,000 ; and a number of nations, such as the Garrows, Goods, 
Bheels, Jits, &c., who do not appear to belong to either of these races. The Hindoos vei 
dark, well-made, slender, and graceful, and their expression is soft and retiring ; less impn- 
sioned than that of the Persians or Arabs. The forehead is small, the face oval, and die mootii 
and nose rather of the European cast. The ears are larger and more promin^t than in ^^ 
peans ; the females of the higher castes, who do not labor, are exceedingly delicate, ff*^^ 
and sylph-like. Their ^es are dark and languishing, and their skins polished and soft. TÂ» 
men have two fashions of dress, one very ancient, the other partly adopted from the MaboBK- 
tans. The ancient dress is in three pieces of cotton cloth, one bound round the waist Â»" 
IklKng to the knees, another wrapped round the body, and the third around the head. ^ 
may be very gracefully disposed. The other dress is cotton drawers, a long robe tied wiÂ»Â« 
scarf, mid a turban. This is the regular dress of the Hindoos ; but the poorer class btve oneo 
but a piece of cloth wrapped around the loins. The head is dually shaved, except a lockb^ 
hind. A smaU pair ol mustacMos are womÂ« The dress of females is very elegant. T^

The Gomexe or Msusoleuni of Sultan 

Mabmoud, at Bejapoor, is a gorgeous spe- 

cimen of oriental architecture, built of 

brick and cfaunara. It is a quadraaele of 

150 feet square, with a dome 150 teat in 

height. Its style is that of grandeur and

The English residents often adopt a mixed 

style of building, combining European coo- 

veuieDce with adaptation to an Eastern 

climate. 

The manner of living la as simple as 
that of building. Only the impure castes 
eat animal food. The only substitute is 
fish, and some clari6ed butter. In the 
south the low castes eat fowls, and the out- 
castes, anything. Kice and vetches, are 
general articles of food. Only the lowest 
castes take intoxicating liquors or drugs.

palm, are the chief intoxicating substan-

The diseases roost fatal to Europeans are fevers, and few such retain for years a good con- 
sdtntion in India. Many of the diseases of Europe are common, and m the cholera Europe 
has received the destroyer from Asia. The first outbreak of this frightful disease was in India, 
and its ravages were aendered more appalling by the mysteiy of its origin and the superstition 
ef the natives. A spasmodic cholera has always existed in India, but it was not until 1817, 
dut it assumed the epidemic character. In the beginning of August it broke out with unpre- 
cedented malignity at Jeasore, 100 miles from Calcutta. From tbat time to the present it hai 
rradually spread over the most populous parts of Asia, and a considerable portion of Europe. 
It is computed, tbat it has destroyed not less than 50,000,000 of people. It prevails over 
erery variety of cUmate, every natural barrier, or artificial defence. Its on'gin, nature, and 
core are unknown. It proceeds capriciously though generally on the great roads or routes of 
oommonication, raging mostly where there are large bodies of people. In the spasms the pain

mddsn cooling of the body. Having proceeded from India to the countries of southern 
Amim, it entered Europe by the way of Astracan, and followed the course of the Volga. 
It attacked the cities in Russia, Austria, Prussia, &.C., and was next communicated to 
England, where its rav^es were slight, while at Paris and its vicinity, they were beyond all 
yumllel. It spread even to America, and was very fatal in Quebec and New York, chiefly 
wmaag ibe immigrants, and the poor and destitute. TH manner in which the disease is

'-id|bo' tecred books of the Hindoos, called the Vedas, constitute the holy word or Shastra,

i^habet According to the Braminical doctrines, the supreme mind or Brahm, acts m the- 
dkee great operations of creating by Brama, of preserving by Vishnu, and of destroying by 
jia m . ; tbesai three powers or energies constitute the Braminical trinity or trimourti, and hsve> 
UMbrposed ra various characters and under various names in the aiTairs of men. By the com- 
aon people ^1 these maoifestaUons of the Eupieme mind are considered as so Biany ^isf be- 
ings or gods, but the philosophers consider them only as attributes or metamorphoses of Brafara. 
The ten avatars or descendants of Visbnu, upon earth, constitute one of the most fertilfi tbemea 
of Siiidoo mythology ; undw various forms, human, monstrous, or brutal, he hÂ»s repeatedly i^ 
peored oB earth, destroyine giants, monsters, &c. The 10th avatar, when he will come to rooC 
out evil from the earth, is yet expected. The veneration of binjte animals, particularly ths' 
cow, Boonkeye, &c., is derived from this doctrine of the divine incarnation in dinerent fbrnaa. 

Metempsychosis or the transmigration of souls is also a leading feature of the Braminical re- 
rig^afi ; according to this belief, the soul of man ader death passes into other bodies,, human or* 
bnito ; and the native of the change depends upon the moral character of the indindual. The 
good rise into higher stales of existence, whi|e- 
the souls of the wicked .animate the mostyile 
and degraded animals. The rites of Biramin- 
isin are chiefly of an irrational or of a. revolting, 
nature ; pilgrimages, penances, afalntiens, boa- 
ors paid to images or sacred animals, and cer^ 
monies of the most indecent or cruel mature,, 
make up its ritual. Pagodas are mimerous. 

There are many wandering fakeers, and' 
many devotees live in solitude, who consider it' 
mentorious to torture themselves. SofPe holrf'

Brahmina, in attention to thoae who stood near her, and

ken o|^, ahe foUowed close to it, attended by the chief 
BrahmiOy and when it was deposited on the pile, she 
kowed to all around her, and entered without speaking. 
The moment she entered, the door waa closed ; the fire 
W9M pat to the eombuatiblea, which instantly flamed, and 
Immeaae ^lantities of dried wood and other mattera were 
' thrown open it. This last part of the ceremony waa ac- 
oampanied'wHh the shouts of the multitude, who now be- 
eaoip nuniofona,and the whole seemed a maaa of confuaed 
lejnieing.*' 

f ^rom a town called Buddruck, in the province of 
Orisaa, Dr. Buchanan writes, under date or :KHh May, 
1806 : " We know that we are approaching Juggernaut 
(and yet we are more than 50 milea from it) by the numan 
Donea which we have seen for some daya strewed by the 
iray. At 9 o'clock thia morning, the temple of Jugger- 
naut appeared in view, at a great distance. When the 
multitude first saw it, they gave a about, and fell to the 
frouftd Mid worshipped. I have heard n<^ing to-day but 
MMMila andaealamationa, by the anceessive bodiea of pil- 
frima. Fkom the place wliere I now stand, I have a view 
â€¢of a heat of people, like an army, encamped at the outer 
.gate of the town of Juggernaut; where a guard of sol- 
â– mn ia pested| to prerent their entering the town, until 
they have paid the pilgrim'a tax." Thia tax is a aource 
of revenue to the Â£ut India Company, who probably 

he akevC Â£kfiQO a year by it. It waa originally im- 

led by the Mabrattaa and Mahometana. On the 14th

ately after death. But the dogs soon receive noliee of Ik

Eiulish often en^ge id the chase of the ferocious, as nell as of the timid animaJs. 

Rice is the prmcipsl article of food, faut nothing can be more mistaken than the supposed 
probibidcm of animal food. Fish is considered one of the purest and most lawful fcinds of 
H>od, and many Bramins eat both fish and kid ; the Rajpoots beside these, eat mutton, 
Tenison, or goat's flesh ; some castes may eat anything but lotrls, beef, or pork, while pork is 
X iarorite diet with others, and beef only is prohibited. latoxicating liquors are forbidden by 
thnr religion ; but this is disregarded by many both of high and low caste, and intoxication is 
not rare even among the Bramins. 

In eoDnquenee of a belief in transmigrations, the Hindoos are scmpulous about taking the 
life of many animals. Some are so careful in this point, that they brush the ground lest they 
tread upon an insect. At Surat there is a Banian hospital, where wounded or helpless animals 
are received, and treated with care. The wards are filled with camels, goats, horses, birdsj 
â– nd even rats, mice, &c. Be^ars are sometimes hired to expose their flesh to the bites of 
insects, from a desire to serve Vveta these. Dying people are removed, when p 
Gai^ea, and the funeral obsequies are performed 96 times in the year. The '. 
early, considerable progress in astronomy, &c., and they have much literature, ( 
dramatic poetry. At Calcutta, the government maintains a Sanscrit college, 
nÂ« funds for dw support of 100 indigent students. There is also a Mabooietan 
struction m the Persian and Arabic languages, and in the Mahometan law. The 
prntant colleges for Hindoo literature at Benares, and Agra, and the Bramiu 
ancient seminaries. 

The Europeans in India frequently pass a dissipated life ; and adopt readily the orientid 
babit of profusion and show. (Me of these, even in a common situation, has many domestics: 
DOt one of which will perform any service out of his own grade, or division of service. The 
servants of a household are therefore very numerous, and the followers of a camp are treble in 
mnnber to the soldiers. 

â–  17. Hirtory. The ancient histdry of this country reaches to a very ntnote anriqni^. Se* 
sostris, Darius, Alexander, and others, bvaded the couutiy at different periods anterior to th6 
Christian era. Mahomet of Ghizni established here the Mahometan power in the 11th centir- 
ly. The Venetians were the first Europeans who traveled to India, and the Portuguese, wlio 
(uscovered the passage round the Cape of Good Hope, were the first that established them- 
selves in the country. Tbe Dutch, English, and French followed. Since the middle of the 
last century the dominion of the English has, by a system of usurpation, iolrigiie, and blood- 
abad, been extended over the greater part of the cotmtry.* 

CHAPTER LXIX. THIBET. 

1. Bowndariet and Extent. Thibet is bounded north by Tartny, east by China, tenth hf 
tbe Birman Empire and Hindostan, and southwest by Htndostan. It is in fact only a long, 
hi^ valley between tbe lofty walls of the Kwenlnn and tbe Himala mountfuns. It contains 
about 400,000 square miles. 

2, Bivtrt, &c. Thibet, at first view, appears to be one of tbe least favored countries under 
bâ€” r an , and in a great measure incapable of culture. It exhibits only low hills with scacca any 
visible vegetation, or extensive arid plains, both of the most stem and stubborn asjiect, proinn* 
log as linla as they produce. The principal river of Thibet is the Sanpoo, which has an 
ssBteriv eoune, and was long thought to be the head of Burrampooier ; this opiaioa has recently 
jeen doubled ; though it Is hard to imagine where tbe Sanpoo terminates, if not in the'Bumm- 
â– ooter. Tbe Bidiu has its sources near the head of the Sanpoo, and flows nonbwesteriy 
rbont 8&0 mites before it breaks throuvh the great mountain barrier nf Himala, and take* a 
ouiberly course. In the same region rises the Suttedge, the largest tributary of the Ganges ; 
I iaaucs from the Lake of lUnean Hrad, wbicb is about 200 miles in circuit. Lake Mono- 
sarowara, in ihli vicinity, is a much smaller sheet of water, but it is an object of religious ven-

lbpu|^ tte mineral has been long collected here, there are no signs of a diminutioa of tbi 
wnntiity ; it is probably constantly forming by fresh deposits from the water. In Thib^n 
ia the west, borax is used for soldering, and as a flux in the fusion of ^old and silver. 

4. Cli$mtU> The climate of Thibet b cold and Ueak in the extrenie, from the severe ^ 
^ts of which the inhabitants are obliged to seek refuge in the sheltered valleys and boQowBi 
Qr amidst the wannest aspects of the rocks. In the temperat|re of the seasons, howem, i 
Ifmarkable uniformity prevails, as well as in their periodical duration and return. 

5. Totms. Laspa or Hla^j the spiritual apd temporal capital of Thibet, the Boiqso( 
Q^o^ini Asia, is the residence of the DaHa-lama, and of the Chinese viceroy, and it cwtm 
ava^t and magnificent temple or palace, surrounded by an immense baaar. Lassa is the M 
of a great transit trade, and it contains a fixed population of aboat 100,000, besides a hiip 
|(oa4ag population of traders and pilgrims. The summer residence of the Lama, on the heigh 
of Pootala, several miles from the city, is 350 feet high, and contains 10,00Q rooms, the suts 
apartments being i^ the top of the building, which is 7 stories in height. The towm and 
spires, are, covered with gold or silver, and there a^ mnumerable images of Baddba of goU, 
llbrer, ^nd bron?;e. In the surrounding plain there are 22 other temples, all richly adoiMd, 
fpd sotoe of them almost rivaling Uiat of Pootala. The whole number of priesl3 bere ibiIb* 
tained at the public charee, is stated to exceed 90,000. 

T^e^h^o iJoomboo os^ Lubrong^ the seat of the Teesboo Lame, and the capital of tbat {^ 
^' Thibet; which is immediately subject to Ins authority, is, in fact, a large nK)nasteiy, coostii- 
ing of tbr^ei or four hundred houses, inhabited by 4,000 gyl^n^s (a kind of monk3 or prie^), 
liee^e taqiples, mausoleums, and the palace of the pontiff, with the residences oC the ymm 
apbordinate officers, both ecclefiastical and civil, belonging to tbe court. It is inckided wiihii 
$^ hollow &oe of a high ropk) and its buildiDgs are all of stone, none less than two stories faigK 
(proofed, and crowned with a parapet. 

6. Manufactures. Commerce. The manufactures of Thibet are ntde^ consisdag priociffll|f 
of shawls and woolen cloth. The exports, which go chiefly to China and Bengal, consist of 
gold-dust, musk, rock-salt, wool, and lamb-skins ; in return for which, silk, satin, gold aod sil- 
ver brocade, tea, tobacco, and furs of various kinds, are received from China ; and from Beo- 
ffly the prodtictioBS of that country, and a variety of English commodities and maauftetures. 

The people are rather stout and hardy, and of a ruddy complexion^ for the mountain bneies 
bestow health .and vigor. They are of various distinct tribes, little known* Tbe langu^v 
of the Sanscrit stock, and is considered by the Chinese much superior to their own in sow> 
They have a great number of sacred books in their monasteries', but little is known of their 
ooBtents. The Thibetans were found to be acquainted with Jupiter's satellites aad SiMn's 
ring, and must, therefore, have made some progress in astronomical science. 

The people of Thibet have made considerabla progress in civilization, but the scieocet tft 
^e^eeled. The literature is chiefly connected with the rel^on, and, together with the 1Â» 
guage, is of Hindoo origin. The' bouses are meanly constructed, and buik of rough stoM 
with a few apertures to admit light. The people may in general be described as mild Â»d ger 
||eÂ« and, though sunk in superstitions, free from many of the sanguinary -customs of the HiodM 
The religion is that of Boodha, which has, however, undergone some changes. Tbe Got 
Lama, or supreme pontiff, it is supposed, is an incarnation of the Deity under difiisrent hff* 
iiMNEes. This cieed includes a belief in the transmigration of aoufe, a future state, pmpMj^^ 
vocation of saints, imege worship^ confession, absobition, paidon, ceUbftcy, bely ^fff^ ** 
various observances of the Romish church. 

There are a great many recluses and temples. There are also a great many subordiv^ 
lamas or priests, who assume the whole business of prayer. Thej sell a certain mu^J- 
prayers, which are writteorout and attached to the cylinder of iLmilli and every turn is s^ppow

CHAPTERLXX. FARTHER INDIA, OR INDL 
GANGES. 

1. 0Â»iindar<u. Farther India, sometimes called Chin-India, comprises an-exteastre region 
lying 10 the east of Hindostaa, and to the south of the Chinese empire. It has the Chinese 
Sea on the east lead south, ifae Btnxi of Sincapore on the south, an 
4e Sea of Bengal on the west. It extends from lat. 2Â° to 2dÂ° n 
1000 east.

Â«inpire iVom north to south, it reaches the sea by 14 mouths, fc 
width. The Salutn, which aim traverses the Birman empire, em 
Martaban. These rivers overflow extensive tracts of level countr 
eourse. The Matam is a la^e river, supposed to rise in the Chine 
whieb, pawfaiK dirauefa Slam, intersects and ferdlizes that country 
enters the Gulf of Slam. The Mecon rises in Thibet, and after 
â–¼inoe of Yonnan, end ttie kingdom of Cambodia, it flows into the 
vfrer of Catnbodia. The climate and productions do not differ m

9. Dindani. Farther India comprises, beside several barbarous peoples, who are ind*- 
pendent, Tonquin, Cochin China and Cambodia, lately the empire of Annam ; the \aDf-

of the Birmese is mote favorably displayed in tbe zayats, pagodas, and lem 
are trul^ magmficent and noble. The description already given of the Sbooi 
â– UustratMMi of tins remark, 

Tbe dress exhibits the same contrast as in other semi-civilized countries ; that of the poor, 
slight and scanty ; that of the rich, splendid. The atdre of the 
ordinary Birman females, is merely a loose robe or sheet, tucked 
under tbe arm, which scarcely serves the purposes of decency ; 
dwliigher classes, and even some of tbe lower, add an itigk or 
jacket, open in frftnt, and generally of muslin or Isce. Nothing it 
wimi on the head, but a cigar is very commonly seen in tfaÂ« 
mouth or hand. The men of the workup classes are neariy sfr- 
ked, the dress consisting merely of a narrow strip of cotton wounl 
round tbe middle, or, when not at work, thrown over the shoul- 
der. The nobles wear a similar wrapper of silk or velvet, wiUi > 
jacket, and all classes invariably wear the turban. The particulw 
dress, and the ornaments indicate tbe rank of tbe wearer, and 
must on no account be assumed by an inferior class ; the same 
ffirnuM. remark is true of the architecture end ornaments of bouses. Tbci 

use of gold in ear-rings, large quills, and masses, and as tbe tna- 
tetial of tbe betel box, spittoon, and drinking cup, designates a nobleman of tbe first rank. 

The principal article of food is rice, generally cooked with chillie or capsicum, but variouv 
odMr vegetables are much used ; roots, fruits, seeds, leaves, and blossoms, with insects, rep- 
tiles, fish, lie. It is not lawful to uke tbe life of ume animals, but even this rule is otud 
evaded, and the flesh of any that have died by accident or disease, is gladly devoured. The 
ficÂ« is eaten with tbe fingers. Smokbg tobacco is almost universal with bodi sexes ; the pipÂ» 
ia rarely used, but the cneroot is as rarely wanting. Chewing the mixture called coon is coiiÂ»* 
BSM here, as in some of the neighboring countries. This preparation consists of a slice of tW 
Â«aca nut, a small piece of cutch or gum, and some tobacoo, rolled up in a leaf of betel peppvy 
wUcb ia smeared with cAutuim or lime. It turns the teeth black, colors the mouth a de^ nd*.

- fi JiSnfd*n of Siam. This kingdom, comprising Sim Proper and part of Laos, Cambo 
Ha^ and Malacca, is bounded N. by China ; Â£. by the empire of Annam ; 6. by tbe Cbhai 
tea wd the Gulf of Siam ; and W. by the Strait of Malacca and iIm Birman empire. It tat 
â€¢d area of 300,000 square miles, and 3,600,000 inhabitants. 

Btmkokt (u the Menam, near its mouth, is a large cirr, widi an active commerce. It ii 
Mtkely built of wood, with tbe exo^on of tbe palace and the temples, and bas aboot 90,000 
Uabkttits, nearly three quarters c^ odiom are Chmese, wbo carry on all tbe foreign commcm 
of Siam. A great number of houses are buih upon nfts moored in the river, and Eomtng > 
toa&g city by itself. 

Sum, or YnUiia, formerly tbe capital, and once a large and populoui city, is now in iM. 
Ia regard to food, dress, buildiDgs, religion, government, fcc, tite Siamese ia geoeral reiefiibta 
ifae Birmese, but nith many minor points of di^rence. In mprotofaiag their sapeinit, th^

dm, and Boodha, Fra Poota Chow, or ttit Lord God Boodba, and dn rilea are neariythi 
e as in Birmafa. Mr. Malcom remarks, that tbe Birmaos make stupendoos pagodw mi

â€¢mall pagodas and priesM' nouses, and bestow their wealth and labor on the Mmj^ ; bÂ«Â«WB

6. Empire of Annam. Annam is bounded north by China ; south and east l>y the Cbi- 
aese Sea, and west by the Siamc)^ State. It comprises the kingdoms of Cochin China, 
Tonqoifib Tsiampa, Cambodia, part of Laos, &o. Area, 280,000 sq. ms. ; pop^ 12,000^0Q0Â«

The gpvanunent; of Annam, as well as that of Siam, is of the most despotic charaoter, 
and in both these States, as in the Birman empire, every male subject above 20* yenm itf 
age, excepting the priests afid public officera, is obliged to give evÂ«y third year to th0 
service of government, either as a soldier or a laborer. The inhabitants are akoit and 
aquat, and have an expression of sprightliness, intelligence, and g^ood humot* ThA 
WDooeo are little better than mere slaves, being oUiged to perform cdl the labttn Ag^

CHAPTER LXXl CHINESE TARTARS 

1. Bovaiariu. This count!;- is bounded north b<p Russia, east hy the Sea of CeiM ari 
tbÂ» Channel of Tartsi;, south l^ China, and west \fy Independent Tartarj. It is inbdilri 
by wandering tribes, but only the western part is occupied by the Torco-Tartars, the rest beif 
in the possession of the Mongols and the Mantchoos, -who are entirely distinct bom Aok 
This country is commonly divided into three parts. 1. IMth Bueharioj in the west ; S. iMm- 
gÂ»tia, in the middle ; and 3. the land of the Jtfanlchooi, in the east. 

3. Swfaee. Most of the country between the Himala asd Altaian Mountains lies at a pal 
deration above the sea, and is composed of several table-lands, intersected by the notaiM 
i^Mina already described under the head of Asia. Between the Altaian and Teenshan moaa- 
tains is the table-land of Zoongaria, from 3,000 to 3,500 feet above the level of the sea, ooa- 
laining Lake Palcaii. Between Teenshan and Kwfuilun is the plateau of Little Bncharia froa 
6,000 to 9,000 feet high, in which lies Lake Lop. Between Kwanlun and the Himala are the 
two table-lands of Eastern Thibet and Western Thibet, elevated from 9,000 to 14,000 feet abon 
the sea. The Mongolian table-land is from 8,000 to 13,000 feet high, and stretclie* ibuK 
the northwestern borders of China Proper. Two great deserts occupy a considerable part of 
this cold and dreary region ; tha desert of Cobi or Skamo, extending through McmgoGi, 
nd the Central Dturt occupying a part of Little Bucharia. On these plateaux and doott 
are scattered volcanic peaks and rolt Uces. The desert of Cobi, is about 3,000 miles in leigd^ 
from northeast to southwest, and from 400 to 600 in breadth, and is crossed like the great Af- 
rican desert by caravans with camels. The ^und is covered in many places with th'~< and 
â€¢hort grass, but the water is geaerally so braclush as to be scarcely drinkable. 

3. Rioeri. Several large rivers traverse this great region. (X these the Arttomr or Sb^*- 
Kan, which, after a long, winding course of 1,600 miles, tlHYiugh Eastern Tartaiy, falls bto the 
Sea of Okotsk, is the principal, and vies with the largest Asiatic streams ; but, from its nob- 
TOrable position, it cootributes little to communication. Tbe Yarkand or Tarim Oowi eift- 
vrardly through little Bucharia into the great hke of Lop. North of the Teenshan, is tbe ifi, 
a eoBsidenible stream, also running east into lake Palcau or Balkash. 

4. Little AncAarui. This country appears to be bounded north and east by Mongolia ; xMii 

by Thibet, and west by Independent Tartary. It is aknosi an- 

tirely unknown to Enropeans, and all the materials on which tti 

' description is founded are imperfect and obscure. The iobdi^ 

tBDts are Turks and Mahometans, and sinee 1759 have been tiA 

nWtj to the Chinese. Tbe principal towns are, Yarkand, Cul^ 

gar, and Aksou. This country is called by the Chinese Teea- 

shan-naidoo, or the province south of the Teenshan. ThefoBBtr 

kingdom of Cashgar, which is now incorporated with it, ^anu * 

wide, fertile, and beautiful plain east of the Beloor Mouatan ; 

this fine r^on, rising like an oasis b a vast desert, is well-Â«atÂ«> 

ed, and carefully cultivated. Cathgar is an old and baadsomJi^ 

built cttf, and the seat of considerable trade. It hat dntf 

40,000 inhabitants, and is occupied by a Chinese garnfok 

Yarhimd b a still larger and more busy city, bemg the pa* 

IWee-ikrtav. centre of tbe inhmd trade of Asia, and the depot of the tiafc 

betwem the north and the south, the east and the west. It cnnuins a great number of itw^ 

nd warebouses kept by Chinese, numerous caravanaeries for tbe reception of strangers, and ill 

baar is remarkable for its great extent. There are also many mo^vsia or colleges here, ai 

tbe population is estimated at 70,000. Mm% is also a great mart and resort for the ca^mu, 

Md has about tbe same number of inhabitants. Khoten^ TV/on, I&sar, and Hani, appa* 

to be important towns, of which we know nothing but their names and their celebrity io lb 

6. Mongolia. Mongolia is an extensive country bounded north by Aaiatic Russia, etftlf 
tiM land of tbe Mantchoos, south by Cbma and Thibet, and vrest by Little Bucharia and ladt- 
pendent Tartary. It includes a great part of the desert of Shamo or Cobi, and is txavenM 
Of the wandering hordes of that'nomadic nee, which, under the name of Monguls or Mog*h 
Mre been so celelxÂ«ted in the annals of Asia. Undar Oei^his Khaa they exta iled ibnr ^ 



rnmion not ooljr over die finest regions of tbis continent, but orer Â» great part <^ nortbem En* 
rope. At present they are sjik into a number of pet^ Statesi dependent on the emperor of 
Chhia. Tne Calmucks, Mongob Proper, Kalkas, the Eluths, on the Lake of Kokonor, and 
tbm Sifansi seem to be the principal tribes* The Mongol tribes are diminutive in person, but 
irawnnhnr and active ; the coimtenance is broad, sf|uare, and flat, with high cheek-bones, note 
depressed, qres small and black and bending obliquelj towards the nose, thick lips, and thin, 
blwk liair. The Kalkas or Black Mongob have been described by a traveler as the dirtiest 
mild ugliest race he ever saw, except the Hottentots. The Mongols lead a roaming, pastoral 
life, with numerous herds and flocks. They are Boodhbts, and have numerous lamas and 
or monks, but these have not the same influence with their brethren in Thibet. In the 
part of thb region was the celebrated Karakorumj the capita] of the largest empire that 
ever existed, and the residence of the famous Kublai Khan, but its precbe situation is un* 
known. The province of Teenshan*peloo, comprising Zoongaria, the country of the Torgots, 
and that of the Kirghises, may be considered an appendage of Western Mongolia. 

6. Conniry of the JUanUkoos or Manchoos. Thb country is bounded north by Siberia, 
firon which it b separated by the Altaian Mountains, east by the Sea of Japan, south by Corea 
and China Proper, and west by a chain of mountains which separates it from Mongolia. It b 
watered by the great river Amour ^ and is almost as extensive as China Proper, but b less known 
to Enropeans than Central Asia. The inhabitants were originally nomades, but since they con- 
quered China, in 1644, their union with a civilized people has occasioned the introduction of ag- 
nocdttire and the arts, and a part of the nation now inhabit towns and viUages. The race who 
at present occupy the throne in China originated in this country. 

Onr Imowledge of this country comes chiefly from Chinese descriptions, which are in gene- 
ral meape and pompous. It presents generally a different aspect from those immense and na* 
ked plains which characterize the centrp of Asia. It appears to be diversified by rugged and 
broken monntam ranges, covered with thick forests, and separated by vaUeys, many of which, 
notwithstanding the coldness of the climate, possess considerable fertility. Their recesses are 
fiHed with wildf beasts of a formidable character, and in such crowds as to render traveling danger* 
ous. Wheat is raised only in the most favored spots ; the prevalent culture is that of oats, else* 
where scarcely an Asiatic grain. The product most valued abroad is the ginseng, the universal 
medicine in the eye of the Chinese, who boast, that it would render man immortal were it pos- 
siUe for him to become so. It grows upon the sides of the mountains. The shores of the 
Ecftem Ocean appeared to La Perouse covered with magnificent forests, but abandoned to 
nature ; a singular circumstance in a region so closely bordering on the over-cultivated and 
crowded empire of China. 

The Mantchoos are by no means destitute of civilization. They possess even a language 
and writing, essentially different from that of the Chioese, or of any other nation of Central Asia. 
The hnguage is distinguished by an excess of smoothness, which forbids two consonants ever 
to come in contact with each other. 

.The Mantchoos are tall and robust, md the e^^es larger, and the face less flat than is the case 
with the Mongols. They are Boodhbts in religion. A part of Mantchooria has been incorpe* 
rated with the Chinese province of Tchele, and contains Chhol^ the summer residence and 
hunting-seat of the emperors. The gardens are very superb and extensive. Borderii^ on 
Corea, is the province of Shin Yang or Leaotong, very populous and fertile, and containin|| 
chies bearing those names. The northern region on the Amour is called Zitzikar, and b the 
original seat of the conquering race. Further east and north b Daouria, inhabited by a mixed 
race of Mongob and Mantchoos. 

The krge bland of SaghaKen or Tarrakai is partly occupied by die Mantchoos, but the niF- 
tives are of a wholly distinct race, called Ainos. They are said by travelers to diflfer frooi 
the inhabitants of the continent in their physical characteristics, but we have no accurate detiilt 
about them. . They derive their subsistence from the chace and fishing, and seem to have no 
knowledge of agriculture, and to be destitute of flocks and herds ; yet th^ are described av 
mild, peaceable, generous, and aflecdonate in their dispositions. Saghalien is about 150 mflte 
m fength by 80 in breadth, and is separated firom the mainland by the Channel of Tartary, but 
b tboi^glit to be connected with the continent by a low, narrow, sandy neck. The iriaiid hae 
the appearance of fertility, and the seas around dbound with whales and fiA. 



CHAPl^R LXXa CHINA. 



1. Bousdaries and Ex4ent. China is bounded by Chinese Tartary on the north ; by 
the Pacific Ocean on the east; by the Chinese Sea 05 the south} and hy Tartary, 
Thibet, Birmah, and Aonatti, on the Veat It extends Â£rom 30Â° to 41Â° N. lat, Mid fM>ni 
100Â° to 131Â° Q. long., and oontainH 1,300,000 square mile^ 

The Chinese empire stretches from 18Â° to 56Â° N. lat^ and from 70Â° to 140Â° R long^ 
covering an area of above 5,300,000 sq. m. or one tenth of the wboie land surface of the 
â€¢arth. The popdlaticm of this vast region is Tory diiferently stated, aooording to the oput- 
ioo adopted in relation to China ProfÂ»er, the estimates of which vary from 150 to 360 m. j if 
Ibe forater sum is adopted, the population of the whole empire may be conjectured to be mouL 
IB5 millions, if the latter, 395 millioas. The regions iackrded under the Chinese nile, are 
China Proper, Cores, Thibet, Bootan, Maochooria, Mongolia, Chinese Turkistan or Little 
Bocbaria, the Loo Cboo islands, &c. 

3. iMo^Mtaint. The provinces of Yuoan, Koeicheou, Secbueen, and Focben, are so 
mountainous as greatly to obstruct cultivuion ; and that of Chekiang has lof^ and precipitous 
BMUBtaias on the west. In die province of Kiangnan there is a district full of high jnouDtains, 
irfaiGli are also numerous in the provinces of Shensee and Shansee. The greater part of ibe 
â€¢eantnr, however, is level, and most assiduously cultivated. 

3. RImti. The two principal rivers of China, are the Soattgho and the Kiangku ; the for- 
ner, called the Yellow River, from its discoloiment hy the mud, which its waters bring dom, 
hat its source among the mouDtains of Thibet, and falls into the Yellow Sea, after a course 
Â«f I,&&0 miles. The Ktanf^u rises near the source of the Hoongho, and after passing the city 
â€¢f NaiJdn, Mb into dw sea about 100 miles to the south of the mouth of the Hoanghot having 
traversed a course of 3,000 miles. There are many rivers of iaferior note in China ; but the 
water of this country is in general very indifferent, and, in some places, must be boiled to make 
h fit for use. 



4. J W Â«Â» Jk The iritod ef ArfHiaA, Bes epon die soudiem coatt, awl form* dm 
Kmil of dio QvM of Tonquki. It ccmtains 14,000 square n^es and is pardy nooinitaiDeui* li 
â– fodueee sugar, indigo, oottoO) vaA rice. Further Dortb is Ihrmosmj a rerj beautiM island ; it 
18 ripb and popalous, but subject to earthquakes. Fordier to the ea$t are the Loo Cftoo hU 
hmdij wiick are well inhabited and productive. The jL^fftona Aland^, to the south of the \mf 
of Canton, are peopled by a race of piiiates. 

5. CKmaU md Soil. The oKiaate of China varies according to the sitnatioii of the plKcea. 
Toward the north it is cold, in the middle mild) and m the south hot. It ia subject in general 
to mat extremes, and resembles rather the. climate of the United States, than that of Eaeop^ 
aad Afriea in corresponding latitudes^ The soil is, either bjr nature or art, fimit&il of eveijw 
thing that can minister to the necessities, coavenieDees, or luflLcines of life ; and agrieuhure m 
oarried to a hi^ degree of excellence. 

6. JMSnerab. Gold is obtamed ttom the sands of rivers in Sechuen and Yunan, but noi 
mines are worked. Silver occurs in considerable abundance, and silver mines are worked in 
Yunan. Tutenague or aine, of which the Chinese make vessels and utensils, occuds in Hoopee. 
Yellow copper conaes from Y\|nan and other province^, and is employed for making small coin, 
which is current throughout the empire ; no gold or silver is coined. The Amous petung oa 
white copper, whicb takea a polbh Kke silver, also comes from Yunan, and quicksilver is ob- 
tained in A.weichoo. Lead and tin oecur, and realgar, or native sulpburet of arsenic, is used 
ia blocka for making pagodas and vases. Earthy felspar or kaolin, ako called porcefauo earthÂ« 
m important materiid in the manufacture of the beautiful China ware, abounds in some provmoes, 
but the Chinese reckon vÂ« or jade as the. first of mmeral substances, end it is much used for 
omunental purposes. Coal extends throuj^ considerable tracts, and good marUe and granite^ 
are found. 

7. ^ffetabh Productions. Clana*ppoduoes all the fhiits oonunon to the tropical and tem- 
perate countries. The camphor (^Lauruo eampAora), taUow {Croion siUfemn), and cinnanon 
trees a^e common in the fields and gardens. The most celebrated production is the tea plant, 
wbicb grows wild here, but is much improved by 'cu-efiil culture. It is a shrub 5 or 6 feet in 
height, producing leaves of dififerent flavor according to the soil, and care with \xrhich it is col- * 
tivi^. It is generally grown in gardens or pkntatioos of no great extent. The leaves are* 
pibered by die cultivator's family, and carried to market, where they are bought by persons, 
who^ trade it is to dry them ; the black teas are dried by exposure to the air, the green in iron

8. Canals. The Imperial Canal is the greatest work of the land in the world, lieii^ TOQt 
laMs in leogdi, and, with the aid of several navigable rivers, aflfoordihg a line of inknd: navigation 
ftooa Pekin to Canton, interrupted only by a single portage. There ane many other oaoak y 
the Chinese are unacquainted with the construction of locks, and the boats pass from one level; 
to another on inclined planes, over which they Â«re drawn npon roQers by menÂ« 

* Â§1 Vmm. Tekin, the cqiital of the whole eropiro of China, and toe ordinary residence of' 
the emperor, is situated in a very fertile plain, 30 leagues distant from the great wall. It is of * 
an oblong form, and is* divided into two towns y that whieh contains the emperor's palace h> 
called the Tartar city. The waUs and gates are of ^ bei^ of 50 leet, ao dlat they hidei die 
^dioie city, and are so broad, that sentinels are pbtted upon them on hoiseback ; there atet

floor ; and few exceeding one story above it. They are oiten showily omanEiented wkh giMed 
aeuhi^ires. Among the rich the doors are often of aromatic wood, richly carved ; giasÂ» is MC 
esed in the windows, and its place is supplied by paper. Of all the buildings m this greÂ«l eilf , 
the most remarkable is the imperial palace ; the grandeur of which does not consist so nivch in 
tbe nobleness and ei^nce of the architecture, as in the multitude of its buildings, conrtS) md 
gndens, all regularly disposed. The population of Pekin is supposed to be about 1,500,â‚¬00. 

Mhnking was the royal residence till the 15th century, but it is now a declinbg city, md a 
kige space within its circuit is unbbabited. It is regularly built, and is a neat if not bandsoRie 
town. Near die entrance are two temples, one of which is rendered interesting by the skMfai 
exeootion of the fibres of about 20 Chinese philosophers and saints, surrounding a great fad. 
The city has obtained cdebrity by the porcdain tower, and by the manufiM^ture of nwikeen.

Canton is the hu^est port in China, and the only port that has been much frequented by 
Enropeans. The city waD is above 5 miles in circumference, with very pleasant walks around 
it. From the tops of some adjacent hills, on which forts are built, you have a fine prospect 
of the country. It is beautifulhr interspersed with mountains, little hiUs, and valleys, aU _ 
and these are pleasantly diversified with small towns, villages, high towers, temples, the 
o{ uMhdarins and other great men, which are watered by delightful lakes, cairals, and 
branches from the river, on which are numberless boats and junks, sailing different ways tfaroaig^ 
the most fertile parts of tbe country. The streets of Canton are very straight, thou^ general- 
ly narrow, and are paved with flag-stones. There are many pretty buildings m thb city, ereat 
numbers of triumphal arches, and temples well stocked with images. There are many fnrme 
walks about the skirts of the town, where these of the better sort have their houses, but wtiidi 
are very little frequented by Europeans, whose business lies chiefly in tbe trading part of lint 
oity, where there are only shops and warehouses. It is computed that there are in this eitj 
ana its suburbs, nearly 1,000,000 persons, and there are often 5,000 trading vessels fying 
before the city. What is called the boat-town is composed of thousands of boats occupied 
by individuals, some of whom are not even allowed to aiter the city. 

Singan^ upon a branch of the Hoangho in the western part of China, if one of the largest 
lowns, and strongest fortresses, m the country. It is said to have a population of 3,000,000 
souls. Hangchouy near the coast to the southeast of Nankmg, is a laife town with extensive 
manufactures and commerce, and a good harbor ; its population is estimated at 600,000. 
SottoAott, upon the imperial canal, is a flourishing place, and is said to contain 700,000 iiihab> 
bants. There are many other large towns in China, the seats of manufacturing and oonunereU 
iadsstry, but little remarkable except for their sise and population. The Clmiese towns have 
no proper name ; but are merely designated from the district of which they are the capital, as 
tka ci^ of Canton, that is, of the province of the name ; or firom some othar circumstance ; as 
Peking, the northern court, that is, the northern residence of the Chinese court, &c. 

MacaOj upon a peninsula on the southern coast of China, belongs to the Portuguese ; it is 
fortified and has considerable commerce, but is mudi sunk in importance. Its population is 
about 30,000. The island of Hang Kong, near by, has been assigned to the EngUrii by tbe 
late treaty, and a town is growing up there. 

10. JigncuUure. The soil in China is considered to be tbe property of the emperor, ev4iy 
tenant paymg one tenth of the produce of the land as a rent. Such tenants often und^et por- 
tions of their estate upon half profits. The processes of agriculture are very imperfect, and the 
artificial methods of cultivation practised in Â£urope are unknown. In the vicinities of tbe gnic 
^es, every inch of ground is carefully cultivated, and the hills are diligentlylbrmed into ter> 
races ; but a great part of the land, even in China Proper, is quite waste, and in tbe other parts 
of the empire husbandry b still less attended to. r 

11. Mant^actwru. China is so happily situated, and produces such a varie^ of materidb 
for manufactures, that it may be said to be the native land of industry ; but it is an indastiy 
without taste or elegance, though curied on with great art and neitoess* The Chinese anba

tbe art of rearing ibe silk-worm was first discovered. The Cfaioese maDufacture silks likewise

oÂ«Â«7 art, that requires minute attention, patience, and manual dexterity. The Coreans rival 
thÂ» Chinese in inaust^, particularly in the fabrication of nankeen and writing paper. 

12. Conmercfl. The domestic trade of tbe Chinese empire is more important than the for- 
lifpt ; it is carried oo by means of numerous rivers and canaU, and consists principally in the 
â€¢zcbuge of tbe natural productions or maDufactures of the different provinces. The vatt ex- 
tent of tbe country, and the great diversity of its 
products have caused tbe Chinese to neglect for- 
eign commerce; still, however, their junks are lo 
be (bund in all parts of the Indian seas. Tbe 
ccHomerce with Europe and America was former- 
ly limited to the single port of Canton ; but, by 
the late treaties, it has been extended to four 
other ports, Amoy, Ftxxhow-foo, Ningpo and 
Shanghae. Tl>e trade is principally in the baadi 
of the English and Americans, and still ccntev 
at Canton. The institution of tjie Hong oMf- 
chants at Canton, a sort of native company or 
corporation, which bad in a great measure tbe 
control of tbe trade with foreigners has been abd- 
ished. The expected increase of the trade with 
China has not followed the opening of the four 
ports. Beside the mariiime foreign commerce, 
there is an extensive inland foreign trad^ carried 
CAuHH Jmdc and Bargt. on witfa Siberia, through Maimatchin, opposil* to 

Kiachu ; with Turkistan, through Yarkland ; with 
Hindosun, through Lassa ; and with tbe Birman empire and Annam. Tea, nankeen, rbubeib, 
poger, poicelain, S(c., are tlie chief articles of expon. Opium from Indian,* furs ^m Nonk 
Aioerican and Siberia, sandal-wood, edible bird's nests, biche de mer or tripang, ivory, ginseng, 
and tobacco are among the principal imports.

14. Government. The supreme authority is vested in the emperor, who is sMed tbe soo 
of baaven ; the crown is hereditary in the male line. His power is limited by the rights of 
certain magistrates, and all officers must he appointed, accorduig to established rules, from the 
teamed. These form three ranks, which depend solely upon the capacity of the candidate to 
ondergo certain examinations. There are no hereditary digniues, except that of princes of tbe 
blood, descendants of Confucius, and one or two others, but the ancestors of a person of dis> 
taiBiisbed merit are often rewarded by titles of honor for the services of their descendant. 

The laws are couched in the simplest language, and promulgated with the utmost possible 
pMici^, that none may be ignorant of them. The punisnments are the bastinado, the pillory, 
tenisbment, hard labor, and death. The common punishment is the bastinado, which is in- 
ficted l^ a lath of bamboo, and sometimes so severely that it occasions death. It is in con- 
stant activity and is inflicted for the smallest ofience, when it is considered a paternal c

liquidate his debts, and if he has no goods he receives 30 blows for every iDonth io which pty- 
ment is delayed, so that he is often forced to sell himself as a slave to satisfy bis creditor. 

The subjects are divided into seven classes ; the great officers of state, called by Europeans 
mandarins, the military, the learned, priests, husbandmen, artisans, and merchants, several of 
which are subdivided into two or more ranks. 

15. InkabUanii. The great mass of the people in China consists of tbtt Chinese, but the 
ruling race, to which belongs the emperor, is the .Manchoos. The Coreani, and many inde 
pendent people of the interior, belong to distinct races. The complexion of the Chinese is 
an olive or darlc brown. The hau- is black ; the eyes are small and blac^, with the point next 
the mrfe mclining a little downwards. The foreheTid is wide, the cheek bones high, and the 
chin pointed. The dress is long and loose. The chief garment is a robe reaching almost to 
die ground. Over the robe is worn a girdle of silk, from which is suspended a knife in a 
sbeath, and the two sticks which are used instead of forks. The shirts are short and wide. 
The trowsers are wide, and in winter thev are lined with fur. In warm seasons the neck is 
bare. The Chinese are by no means a cleanly people, either in person or dress. They seU 
dom wash their garments, and they carry no pocket-handkerchiefs. The hair is shaven, except 
a long tuft on the crown, which it plaited somewhat like a whip, and often extends below the 
knees- The covering for the hefid is generally a cap of woven cane, shaped like an inverted 



bro^i 9 L,iantM. 

', cone. No person is fully dressed without a fan. The dress of females of the common ranks 

I dISers little &om that described. Their robes are long and closed at the top. An outward 

. jacket IS worn over them. Paints are universally used, though with little taste. The teeth are 

I colored yellow or ^een. The nails of the higher classes are permitted to grow to several 

f inches ; and they are kept in bamboo sheaths. The shoes of a Chinese lady are about 4 

inches in length] and 2 m breadth. Id bfancy the feet are so closely swathed, that they 

cease to grow. This deformity is considered as a beauty, and so far from being able to daoce, 

it is with the utmost diiBculty a female thus mutilated can walk. The Manchoo ladies and the 

' women of the lower classes do not compress the feet. Cluldren are not pennitted to wear silks 

'â–  or furs, or to have the head covered, till a certain age, when they assume the dress of men 



TkÂ» ftTBiOfti aitide of food ib rioe, which is eotea with ahnost ereiy sort of victuab, hat 
â–  m tlw DHtb corn u mors aeed. The Maocboos eat horse-flesh, and we lower classes, wha 



are miserably poor, and often suffer from famine, do not refuse the most loathsome Temun. 
Tea is the usual drink, which has now become almost as common in Great Britain and the 
United States, as in its native country. Edible bird's nests, which consist of some sort of 
gelatinous matter, tripaog or sea slug, shark fins, 
and fish maws are among the luxuries of the 
Chinese table ; opium, though forbidden by law, 
is much used. Dogs, cats, and rats are eageriy 
sought after by the poorer classes, and puppies 
are constantly hawked about the streets, to be 
eaten. 

When China was first explored by European' 
travelers, it was believed to be a nation that btd 
alone found out the true secret of government ; 
where the virtues were developed by the opera- 
tion of the laws. A greater Umiliariiy with die 
Chinese has destroyed the delusion, and tbor 
virtues are the last subject for which they can 
claim any praise. Few nations, it is now agreed, 
have so little honor or feeling, or so much dtqA- 
city and mendacity. Their aifected gravity is as 
for from wisdom, as their ceremonies are from 
politeness. The females, as in all unenligbiened 
countries, have to suffer for the state of socie^ ; 
DogStUtT. ^^y P^^s B '''^3 of labor or of seclusion, the 

slaves rather than the companions of man. 
China is known to us principally from the missionaries and the embassies. Wherever ihe 
Enropean passes, by land or water, for the rivers have their thousands, he sees masses of peo- 
ple ; out only of one sex, with good humor pervadbg the whole. He sees soldiers with paper 



CHINA. 407 

helmets, quilted petticoats, and fens ; he sees punishments inflicted in the streets, aH die opert- 
tions of trade carried on there, and s^ns orer the shopq affiimii^, that tkey do not cheat htrt, to 
do awajr the more probable supposition tbtt they do. The government of China is one of bar, 
sod it hag produced the usual effects, duplic!^ and meanness. Prostration to autbori^ is no- 
where more bumble than in China. Ceremony <firects the life of the Chinese, and their moat 
indifferent actions are moulded on it. Their very filial du^, which is prescribed to such an 
extent, as to destroy the principle, is rather a political institution than a sentiment. It gives 
to the parents too much authority to leave space for affection. The parents have the right to 
destroy or mutilate their infant children, and thousands are exposed yearly to perish in the 
rivers. A sou is a minor during the life of his fetber, and liable for aU the parental debts but 
those contracted by gaming. The government susuins in- the greatest rigor all this parental 
authority ; as the emperor assumes, that he is the 
general father, that he may exact from all, more 
than the obedience that is paid to a father by a 
son. The lash of the mandarin's whip or the bam- 
boo is often applied in the most summary man- 
ner. Marriage in China is hardly an affair of the 
affections. The husband does not see his future 
wife till she is brought to his house, and then the 
Chinese laws of gallantry allow him to send her 
back, if, on opening the palanquin, he discovers 
her to beunaitnicdve. Divorces may be bad on 
grounds as slight as those of this rejection ; and 
even excessive loquacity in the females is a legal 
cause. The funerals areconducted vrith pomp, ^ 
a ceremony truly Chinese. The coffins of the 
rich are costly and th^ are often provided for years 
before the decease, and a poor man has beea 
known to sell himself to slaveiy, that he might 
give his father a splendid burial. The festival 
in commemoration of the dead is held by mem- 
bers of the same family, the rich and the poor, 
at the expense of the former. There aie many 
festivals, but games of chance are the com- 
mon amusements. Cards and dice are always 
carried about. Quail Gehting and locust fighting 
are common, and the Chinese are unmoderetely 
fond of them. The fireworks excel those of 
ManJarin't qffi^. Europe. The chief festival is the feast of Ian â–  

' tons, when goi^eous lanterns are everywhere displayed. 

16. Language, Literatitre, JlrUy &c. The language is a string of monosyllables, and these 
are not numerous, but their meaning is varied by different pronunciatitms. Thus the word tehu, 
spoken by lengthening the u, means master, when pronounced rapidly it signifies kiiclun, and 
when spoken with a loud voice, and depressed toward the end, it signifies pillar. The langui^e 
d* the provmces vanes, and even among the natives of the same provinces signs are used (o 
relieve the ambiguity of words. There are not more than 350 sounds in the language, that can 
be distinguished by the English alphabet, and the written language has 40,000 characters, rep- 
resenting objects or ideas. The vocal language being so deficient to the ear, it is common, to 
prevent mistakes in talking, to make with tne finger the sign of the character that one means to 
express by the word ; numerous, very difierent and discordant ideas have to be express- 
ed by one sound so similar, that the difference cannot be conveyed by our alphabet. 

The Chinese characters seem devised as a conuDunication between those who are de- 
prived of speech ; the sign is sometimes arbitrary, and at others it represents tlie object de- 
scribed. Thus a prison is represented by a square, denoting an inclosure ; and the addition of 
â€¢ dot within it, represents a prisoner. The character that represents a tree, used twice, 
denotes a thicket, and thrice, a forest. The character for time, repeated, means eternity. 
Some of the combinations of the characters to express other ideas are ingenious. Thus 
the chancters combined, of rood and vord, make prmn. A bai|;am is denoted by word and 
â–  9Â«1 ; tow^forl u txprwaeaby rieÂ» nd nrnth^ nd UiUaiÂ»g by door and mt. The com-

The literature of the Chmeee is the richest and most important of Abib. The clu^ 
woriu called King are of great antiquity, and the disciples cS Confucius have made them the 
basis of their labors in morality and poUtics. History has always received the attention of the 
Chinese, and their annals tbrm the most complete series extant in any language. Foeny, the 
drama, and romantic prose fictions are among the productions of the Chmese uterati, and ibeir 
dictionaries, encyclopedias, commentaries, &c., are numerous ; they use silk paper, printii^ 
only one side. Geography has been cultivated among them from a remote penoo ; the impe- 
rial geography forms 260 volumes, with maps. Astronomy and mathematics have oot miile 
much progress, and medicine is practised with a variety of superstitious ceremonies Dnvii^ 
â– ad pautii^ are executed with mechanical skill, but without a knowledge of scientific prioci- 
pleo. It is remarkablo, that the Chinese were in possession of three of the most iinportuit io- 
ventioas or discoveries of modem umes, long before they were known to the nations of Europe, 
beside wUch Uiey were the inventors of two remarkable manufactures, silk and porcelain. The 
art of printing was practised at least aa early as the 10th century, but the use of movable types 
insteaaof blocks seems never to have occurred to this ingenious people. The knowledge of 
guipowder omoHg them dues at a v^ remote period, but here again they stopped short in (lie 
Mpueatton of it to use, not having applied it to firearms until they learned so to do iiaiD 
Europeans. Finally, thie peculiu directive properties of the loadstone were applied to putpo- 
fea w navigation by the Chinese several centuries before they were employed in Europe. 

The wchitecture resembles that of no oilw 
nation. The houses appear fantastic, if coni- 
pared with the (Hxlers that are estabHsbed u 
standards in Europe. They are generally of 
wood, and mostly of but one story. The} 
are small, and the partitions are sligbt, fre- 
quently only mats. The whole budding is 
surrounded by a wall six or seven feet high. 
Each house contains a family of several gene- 
rations. The most solid material is balf-buni 
brick, and the mansions of the highest as veil 
as the lowest are formed on the model of tbe 
primitive Maochoo tents ; even in ibe gieil 
cities, a traveler might fancy himself, fron die 
i.iinu>e L.iq. low houses, with carved overhan^g roofe, ud- 

interrupted by a single chimney, and from tte 
pillars, poles, flags, and streamers, to be in the midst of a large encampment. Tbe froats of 
tbe shops are covered with varnish and gilding, and painted in brilliant colors. The exteroi 
splendor of the palaces and pagodas consist merely in colored varnish and gilding. 

Tbe great wall is one of the most remarkable monuments of Chinese industry, and is oce w 
the greatest works ever executed by man. It extends along the northern frontier for the dis- 
tance of 1,500 miles, over valleys, rivers, and mountains, and has stood for S,000 veon. !< 
consists of two brick walls at a little distance from each other, forming a sort of shell, wbidiB 
filled up with earth, thus composing a solid rampart, about 15 feet thick, and varying in diier- 
ent places from 30 to a few feet in height. It was constructed as a defence against the W"^' 
die warriors of central Asia. The great garden near Peking, attached to a royal summer resi- 
dence, covers 60,000 acres, and is filled with artificial bills, rivers, lakes, Jttc , and adncnHi 
with palaces, pavilions, and every sort of decoration, that human ingenuity can devise. 

The facilities for traveling are chiefly confined to the rivers and canak, and these are filled 
with every variety of craft. Tbe inns are mean, and afford little but shelter. The sedsn Â« 
l^alaMpiin is the common vehicle of China. Besides tbe dromatic exhibitions, which are soM

the amusements of the Cbbese. Among their singular customs, ma.j be mentioned the pncticÂ«

CHAPTER LXXIII. EMPIRE OF JAPAN , 

1- Extent. This empire coosists of several islands m the Pacific Ocean, lying between lat< 
39^ and 47Â° N., and lone. 128Â° and 1 50Â° E., and separated from the continent b; tbe 8ea of 
Japan and the channel of Tartar7. It has an area of 240,000 square miles, and a impulatton 
of 26,000,000 soula. The principal islands of the group are Niphon, Sikoko, Kiusiu, and 
Yesso or Matsmai ; the southern part of Seghalien belongs to Japan, and tbe northern to Chi- 
na ; some of the Kurile islands also belong to the former. The lofty mountains which inter- 
sect the principal islands, and tbe exposure to the sea-breezes render tbe climate cool. Earth- 
quakes are common. 

2. Productioni. Rice, hemp, and silk, and tbe various tropical fruits are produced in abun- 
dance in the southern parts. The milky juice of tbe vamisb trees supplies the beauuful lacker 
or japan ; the tea-tree and bamboo are indigenous. Agriculture is carried to great perfection, 
and as there are feiv cattle or sheep, there are no meadows, and fences are not necessary. Tbe 
corn fields, cotton plantations, rice grounds, and mulbeny orchards are often very extensive. 

3. Toima. Yedo, the capital, upon the Island of Nipbon, is one of the largest and most 
populous cities in the world, having a circuit of 53 miles, and a population of 1,300,000 soub. 
The port is shallow, end accessible only to small vessels. The houses are constructed of bam- 
boo, covered with mortar, and are but two stories high. Paper supplies the place of glasa, 
apd the floors are covered with matting. The palace of the emperor is nearly 15 miles in cir- 
cumference and is strongly fortified ; the citadel or inner fort is inhabited by the imperial family, 
and tbe outer fortress by the nobility. The hall of a hundred mats is 600 feet long and 300 

_wide, with tbe doors and cornices finely lackered, and the locks and hinges richly gilt. 

IRo or Mtaco was for a long time the capital, and contains the most remarkable edifices. It 
IS also the residence of the dairi or descendant of the ancient emperors, who is the spiritual 
bead of the empire. The dairi's palace is, in itself, a town surrounded with walls and ditches ; 
tbe imperial palace is also a large building. The temple of Fokosi, paved with squares of 
white marble, and adorned with 96 columns of cedar, is about 1 ,000 feet in length, and con- 
tains a colossal statue of Buddha, 83 feet in height. Tbe temple of Kwanwon is httle inferior 
to tbe pcsceding ; in the midst sits the goddess, with 33 hands, surrounded by crowds of sub- 
erdinata deities ; and innumerable statues of all sizes, and richly gilt, are placed around <n

wares are purchased here in their greatest perlectioo ) aad all the mooey of the empire is coiaed, 
, and most of ibe books are pnoted here. 

Nangeudki, on ihe island of Kiusiu, is the only port in which Toraign vessels are sufleted to 
come to anchor. 

4. Gottmrntni. The goveroment of Japan is an instance of a system which has often exist- 
ed in the east, as well as in some other countries. Tlie oomiDal monarch termed the Dairi, bii 
a religious character, and is the head of tbe national religion. In this way, his ancestors Got 
â€¢Itained their power. But though he still retahia bis name as emperor, he has lost all ml 
authority, which is exercised by the Kubo or Jogun at the head of ibe troops, who has takeo 
oa himself tbe administration, and has the control of all ciTil a&lrs. The Dairi, meanwhile 's 
kept a close prisoner, con6ned to his palace, which bs b iMt pomittsd to leave except occanoo- 
ally on a visit to some of the principal templet. 

5. Afanufacturet and Commerce. The Japanese ekcel in working in copper, iron, and 
steel ; .their silk and cotton goods, porcelain, paper of the bark of the mulberry, lackered ware 
(thence called Japanned), and glass are also made in great perfection. Their for^gn commerce 
is inconsiderable ; the Japanese are forbidden to go out of tbe country, and the port of No- 
nsaki is open only to the Ctunese, Coreans, and Dutch, and even to tbem under great reUric- 
tions. The inland and coasting trad* is, however, extensive ; tbe ports are crtwded with 
vessels, and tbe fairs thronged with merchants. 

6. Religion. There are 3 forms of religion prevalent in Japan. The religion of Sinto ii 
fotAded upon the worship of gAnii, or subordinate gods, from whom tbe dairi is supposed to be 
descended. The genii or kiami are the souls of tbe virtuous, who have ascended to beaveo; 
in their honor are erected temples, in which are placed the symbols of the deity, consbtii^ of 
strips of paper, attached lo a piece of wood ; these symbols are also kept in the bonaes, lod 
before these are offered the daily prayers to Uie kamis. The domestic chapels are also adoiaed 
with flower and green branches ; and 3 lamps, a oup of lea, and another of wine are plieed 
baibre tbem. Some animals are also venerated, as sacred to tbe kamis. The sacnfiesi, 
â€¢dersdatcenainseisons, consiotof rice, cakes, eggs, &e. Buddhism was in&wluced into JifiB 
Jiroia Corea, and in many cases is so far mingled with the religion of Sinto, that the same tsÂ» 

fcaarve for both, and accommodate the images of the kamis, together with those of lb( 
dblst gods. Tbe priests of Budda, in Japan, are called Bonzes, and tbey are numeroai, 
comprising both males and females. They are under t 
vow of celibacy, and there are here, as in otber Buddlnat 
countries, targe convents for both sexes. The docttiu 
of Confucius has also been broi^t into the couotry, end 
has many followers. 

7. InkahitanU. Tbe Japanese have a broWn comp^' 
ion, black hair, and the obliaue eye, which cbaracieritei 
ibe Chinese. They are middle sized, well formed, wl 
active, and in character intelligent, courteous, industrious 
and honest, but suspicious and vindictive. Tbey ate nun 
cleanly than the Glunese, and more ready to adopt tbe im- 
provements of other nations. Women hold a higher rail 
than in China ; tbey are educated with the same cue H 
the men, and enjoy the same degree of liberty as in Euro- 
pean countries. Most of tbe arts and sciences have been 
borrowed from the Chinese, and in many respects tbe 
J wanes e are still much behind that industrious people. 

The Japanese are a religious people, and their reUpo*' 
deals much in festivals, of which they have 5 great auml 
ones, besides 3 smaller monthly ones, celebrated ntber 
with noisy mirth and revels, than with tÂ«ligioiis obserro* 
ces. Pilgiimage is the cDstom to which they are mat 
strongly addicted, and which they practise with the gn<^ 
JhMrf* Bmtf, ^^* *^' '^^^ ^^ads m summer are thronged with cmwdl 

of devotees on their way to some sacred spot. ^, w

CHAPTEft LXXIV. GENERAL VIEW OF AFRICA. 



1> Bovitianet aad Extent. Africa is a rast peniDsula joined to tlie Asiatic coDtineot on 
the Qortbeaet, l^ the narrow isthmus of Suse. It is bonnded nonh hy the Mediterranean 8ea, 
east by tbe Red Sea and Indian Ocean ; south by the Southern Ocean, and west by the At- 
lantic Ocean. It extends from 38Â° N. to 35Â° 8. latitude, and from 17Â° W. to 51Â° Â£. longi- 
tude ; greatest length, from 
Cape Blanc, ifl Tunis, to Caps 
Agulhas, 5,000 miles ; great- 
est breadth from Cape Verd to 
Cape Guardafut, 4,600 miles â–  
area, 11,500,000 square miles , 
population, 60,000,000. Ftchii 
about 6Â° nonli to 35^^ south, 
the interior of this country, com- 

G rising a tract of about 3 mil- 
ons square miles, is wholly 
unknown, and with much of 
the remainder we are imper- 
fectly acquainted. 

2. Mounlaing. Our igno- 
rance of this vast division of 
Uie globe renders it impossible 
to describe these great natural 
features with any accuracy. But 
Africa seems to have neither 
the lofty mouniain chains nor 
the magnificent rivers of Asia 
and America. In general, tbe 
African roountdns appear to be 
more remarkable for breadth 
than height. In the north is 
the Atlas range, rising in some 
places to the height of above 
lS,000feet. TbeKongMovn-

of which these littoral cbaiasn 
merely ihe steep sides, deseed-

3. RxBtrt. We are ooi ic- 
quainted with the whole cone 
of the largest rivers of Africa. 
The sources of the princ^ 
branch of the Alk are yet voca- 
lain. The Quorro or Jdgtr b 
known to as only in the apna 
and lower part of its course. Tba

inent capes are Cape Bliau, in

5. CHmate. With the exception oi comparatively narrow tracts on the northern aod sOiAen 
coast, the whole of this continent lies within the torrid zone, and presents the largest massrflwl 
within the tropics on the earth's surface. Africa is, therefore, the hottest region on tbeGiee<* 
the globe. The effect of its tropical position is still further heightened by the nature ofiw 
soil and the surface ; the vast desert tracts of bare sand aod shingle, serve as a great reservoir 
of parched and heated air, the influence of which is often felt even in the more temperate re- 
gions of Bnrbary and the Cape Colony. The khamseen in Barbary and Egypt, and tbe Inr* 
mattan in Guinea, are dry, huraing winds from tbe deserts The low 00101(1700 ike si *

?â€¢ Ftget^le Produclioni. ' The northern regions of Africa present mucb the same veeetSF 
tioo as the southern parts of Enrope, with some distinguishing features, however, that forbod* 
dit transitioD to the tropics. On the Barbary coast we find groves of orange and olives J 
wide fields of wheat and barley ; thick woods of evergreen oaks, cork trees, and sea pinet 
(Pitua iqaritima), intermixed with cypresses, myrtles, and tree heaths [Erica arbarta), while 
pdmetto trees end wild capers cover the hills and rocks. The principal objects of culture 
m the Bsrbary States are a species of wheat {Triticum durum], the culm of which is solic^ 
aod tfae kernel bomy, rather than farinaceous ; barley, used for the horses instead of oals J 
maizÂ« and caffre-coru (Hokui torgUvm), rice, tobacco; figs, pomegranates, iujubes, sugar- 
cane, &c. In the mountainous tracts to the south grows the sondarach tree {Thuya arficu- 
lata) whose durable wood is used iu the construction of mosques, and is supposed by some t9 
be tbe shittimwood of Scripture. The borders of the great desert and the oases yield the date- 
palm, affording tbe chief sustenance of tbe inhabitants. Egypt produces tbe vegetation of 
both these regions, with the acacias (â€¢S. nihttica), which yield the gum arabic, tamarisks, tb* 
senna (Cassia oblusifolia), the doom palm (Crucf/era J%ebaica), the cardamoms, castor-o3 
pbnt (Aictnut) ; safflower (Carlhamvs tinctorins), yielding an esteemed dye ; the papyrus 
(P. anli^uorum), from which the old Egyptians made their material for writing ; the lotus 
[SSxyphus lotos), of which the ancients related many fables, &c., in the equinoctial regions 
exhibit new forms of vegeiatlon. The huge baobab (tSdansonia), the fruit of which aSbrds the 
natives a grateful drink, the cotton tree (Bombax pentandrvm), groups of oil palms (Elai 
gwteensis), sago palms (Sagvs rapha), the grotesque chandelier tree [Pandantis cttndtlabrttm)^ 
with its long, rigid, channelled leaves, &c., are among the characteristic productions of the 
tropical countries. The cassava (Jatropka manihot), yam (Diotcona), pigeon pea (C^ftsui 
man), and ground-nut (â€¢JrocAw hypogaa), are the farinaceous plants which supply the place 
M tbe cereal grains of temperate climates ; the papaw (Carica papaya), the tamarind, Sene> 
gal custard-apple (,3nona Senegalensis), the doura tree {Parhia ^fricana), tbe musanga, 
cream fruit, monkey apple, mammee apple, &c., are among the useful trees. In the vast 
karroos of Southern Auica, there are few plants that rise to the dignity of trees, but vuioua 

succulent plants, euphorbias, carrion flowr 

ers {tlapeiia), aloes, fig marigolds (me- 

* sembryanthemum), orcbiden, &c.), with 

numberless species of heath, geraniums, 

cycades, &c., usurp the place of forests. 

8. DessrU. The Desert of Zahan 

occupies 8 great irart of Northern Africa, 

extending from Egypt to the Atlantic. 

The Great Soulhem Desert is supposed 

to occupy most of the interior to the 

south. These deserts form a prominent 

feature of the country ; no other portion 

of the globe exhibits anything comparable 

to them. They are oceans of saod under

The Chimpanzee or Pat^ (PUhew iroglodyte$) lives in Guinea and Congo, where it is 
found m troops. It constructs huts of leaves and branches of trees, arms itself with stones 
and clubs, and employs them to repulse from its dwelling both men and elephants. It ap- 
proaches the human form more nearly than any other animal. Naturalists have coDstaotly 
ootifouaded it with the orang outang ; but it can walk upright, which that animal cannot do. 
It is said by travelers to exceed the human stature. The Masot or Barbary Jlpe (Macacra

Tbe Jackal (Canit aureus) inhabits the 

southern parts of Africa. Its voice ii like 

that of the wolf, but it is more voracious. Il 

never stirs alone, but always hunts its prey b 

packs of thirty or forty by night. It iiucti 

almost every kind of beast or bird, sod ofieii 

feeds on (be carcasses of men and snimils. 

The Ftnnee (C. Zerba) is a curions isi*

aid Doditm and Claj^Mrton bran^ home s sUn from Cenml A(ho%, Bnioe dÂ«scribei it at 
of a dtrtj-white color, and about 1 inches long. Duriog the day, it was iBoKned lo sleep, bat 
maa exceedingly ucquiet as night came on. It builds its nest on trees. The hhtuvmrn {Maai- 
Mtuta Icfuieumon)^ is domeslicated in Egypt, where it is serviceable in destroying rati and mice. 
Il attacks almost every living creature, and feeds entirely on animal flesh ; it hunu alike birds, 
quadrupeds, serpents, lizards, and insects. It is said to swim and dive occasionally. 

The Leopard {Felii Itopardw). This for- 
midable and sanguinary animal, is found neatly 
throughout the whole of Africa, and in eastern 
and southern Asia. He usually measures abow 
3 feet in length, exclusive of the ull , but iccoe- 
times reaches 4 feet. His appearance mdi- 
cates his natural disposition. He has a rest- 
less eye and a sinister countenance, and all his 
I motions are basly and abrupt. In rapidity, 
agilily, and precision of motion, he is unrival* 
I ed by any other animal ; an advantage which 
he owes to the strength of his muscles, the 
I suppleness of his joints, the extreme pliabitiiy 
of his spine, the greater lateral compression 
of his body, and the slender proportions of 
TU Lmpfd. ^'^ limbs. His prey, on which he darts frotn 

bis hiding-place, and even pursues up the trees, 
conusts of antelopes, monkeys, and the smaller quadrupeds. Usually, be shuns man ; but, 
when closely pressed, he turns upon the hunter, and hunger will drive him to attack, thoi^by 
stealth, the buaun race. 

The Caracal or Siya Gutk {F. caracal) is lai^er than the fox, 
and is remarkably fierce and strong. He generally feeds on what 
is left by the lion, but sometimes attacks and devours hares, rab- 
bits, and birds. The Soottdf Lynx {F. ealigala), and Serval {F. 
Hrval), are found in different parts of Africa. The Tiger Cat of 
â€¢Sfticaor Cape Cat (^F. eapeiuu). This beautiful animal was er- 
roneously supposed, by Bufibn, to be the same as the Serval of 
' India ; but we have recently seen a living specimen in Boston, 
from which the accompanymg accurate likeness was taken, and 
^ r. MMcd. which enables us to testify to the accuracy of the following desciip- 

tion from Shaw. " This animal is extremely brilliant in color, it 
being of the brightest fulvous yellow, with jet black 
stripes and spots ; the chin, throat, and breast, pale 
ash color ; along the back are black stripes ; on the 
sides of the neck, end on the breast, numerous small 
crescent-shaped spots, pointing upwards ; on the l^s, 
numerous roundish spots ; and the tail very strongly 
and distinctly annulated with black and yellow."

The ISriped Hycena {H. villota) is a native of Barbary, Egypt, Abyssinia, Nubia, Syni) 
Persia, and the East Indies. It eenerally resides in the cameras of mountains, in the clefts of 
rocks, or in dens, which it has iormed for itself, under the earth. It lives by depredatioD, 
like the wolf ; but it is a stronger animal, and seemingly more daring. It sometimes ailiclu 
man, carries off cattle, follows the flocks, breaks open tbe sheep-cotes by night, and rHTS|e) 
with a ferocity insatiable. By nighi, also, its eyes shine ; and it is maintained, that it sees 
better than in tbe day. If we may credit all the naturalists who have treated of tUs animil, 
its cry is very peculiar, beginning willr something like tbe moaning of a human being, and end- 
ing in a sound which resembles the sobs or retchings of a man in a violent fit of vomiting ; but 
according to Kempfer, who was an earwitness of ibe fact, it sounds like tbe lowing of a calf- 
When at a loss for other prey, it scrapes up ihe earth with its feet, and devours the carcisses, 
both of animals and men, which, in the countries that it inhabits, are interred promiscuous!; ii 
the fields. 

Tbe Spotted Hyama {H. crocvta) is a native of Southern Afripa, and abounds in the nei^ 
borhood of the Cape of Good Hope, where it 
is called the Tiger Wolf. It is somewbit in- 
ferior in size to the Striped Hysna, but, ia in 
wild state, has tbe same manners and fH'opcD)^

feems as if nature bad made use of the rule and compass to paint it. These aluunat* band* 
of black and white are so much the more singular, as they are straight, parallel, and very ex- 
actly divided, bke a striped stuff ; and as they, in other pans, extend themselves not only over 
the body, but over the head, the thighs, the legs, and even the ears and the tail ; so that, u â€¢ 
distance, this animal appears as if it was surrounded with little 611eta, which some person hei 
disposed, in a regular manner, over every part of the body. In the females, these bands are 
alternately black and white ; in the male, they are brown and yellow, but always of a lively end 
brilliant mixture, upon a short, fine, and thick hair ; the lustre of which, still more increase* 
the beauty of the colors. The dow, and the quagga, are distinct species of this genus. 
The J/riean Elephant {Elepha$ Jfricantu) is a distinct species from the Asiatic. The 
elephant is the most sagacious of all animals, 
and the most easily tamed ; and yet llie indo- 
lent inhabitants of Africa hare never converted 
this noble quadruped to any useful purpose. 
Herds of elephants are frequently met with m 
the middle regions of Africa. They are fond 
of rivers, deep valleys, shady places, and 
marshy grounds. It cannot subsist long willf 
out water, with which they often fill their 
trunks, and sprinkle it about for amusement 
They sufler equally from excessive heat or 
cold, and penetrate the thickest forests, t* 
avoid the burning rays of the sun. Notwith- 
standing their unwieldy figure and great size, 
ihey walk so fast, that ihey can easily overtake 
a man running. Their common food is rooli, 
herbs, leaves, and young branches ; they di^ 
like flesh or fish. As they go in laige berda, 
jlfnta^ Â£2n>iaat. ""^ Â°^^ " B""^^' quantity of fodder, they often 

change their places, and when they find ctdli- 
vMed lands, they make prodieious waste ; their bodies being of an enormous weight, Ihey de- 
stroy 10 times more with their feet than ihey consume for their food, which may be reckoned 
at the rate of 150 pounds of grass daily. These animals are more numerous in Africa than in 
Asia, and they are of a different species, not being so Jarge, and being less wild, than the Asi- 
atic elephant. The latter, also, is distinguished from the African species, by having 5 toes oa 
each foot, instead of 3. , 

Two species of the fno-homed AAtnocÂ«- 
nw (ft. ^fricaniu andBwchtlH) are fowtd 
in South Africa. The horn of the female 
is, however, much longer and more slender 
than that of the male ; being sometimes S( 
feet long. Being a strong, ponderous, and 
elastic substance, it is much prized by tbe 
natives, for handles to their battle-axes- 
The secondary bom is, in many instances, 
so small as to be seareely perceptible at a 
little distance. The general figure of tbe 
Rhinoceros, is that of an enormous hog. 
His prodigious size and strength, and hia 
destructive bom, seem to point out this ani- 
mal, as (he real unicorn of Scripture-

he does in the open air. When he quits ii

The Engallo or African Wild Boar (Phatcochotros) is, perhaps, the most hideous (^ all uii- 
â– lals ; its tusks are curved upwards, towards the forehead. When attacked, it will often ru^

The i^irti^r (^tUopt tvclwre) inbabiu the Cape of Good Hope, and is there called the 
^tring bok, from the prodigious leaps it takes, vbeo 
any person suddenly appears ; when thus alarmtd, ii 
has the power of extending ibe white space ibout tbe 
tail, into tbe form of a circle, which returns to iu liDW 
form when the animal is tranquil. When pursued, it is 
pleasing and curious to see the whole herd leaping lo i 
ooDsiderable height over each others ' heads ; and ibej 
will sometimes take 3 or 4 leaps successively. Inlbii 
situation, they seem suspended in the air, loolitDg over 
their shoulders at their pursuers, and forming ihe radim 
of the white pan about the tail, in a most beautiful mm- 
ner. They are extremely swift, and it must be a good 
~ horse that can overtake tbem. They migrate Biinuillr, 
from the interior of tbe country, in small herds, Â»vi 
^ruifs-. pontioue near the Cape for 2 or 3 months, and iba 

retreat towards tbe north, in herds of roany diousuids, 
covering the great plains for several hours in their passage. 

Tbey are attended, in these migrations, by numbers of lions, hysnas, and other wild beisU â–  
â€¢f prey> which cvmmit great devastation among them. They also make periodical mignitcxts, 
in 7 or 8 years, in herds of many ihousanib, 
from the north ; being, probably, compelled (o 
leave their haunts iu the Terra deNatil,!^

sometimes happens, that not a drop of nis

The Gnu (^. Gnu) is one of the swiftest beasti that range the plains of Africa. Tbotiqtb 



â–  small animal, it appears of considerable size when pancing over the plains. It possesses, in 
an eminent degree, strength, swiftness, weapons of defence, acute scent, and quick sight. 

The Camehpard (^Camehpardalii antujuorum), or Giraffe, is one of the tadesi, most beau- 
lifolt and most harmless animals in nature. The enormous disproporiion df its legs is a great 
obsucle to the use of its strength ; its moUon is waddling and stiff ; it can neither Ry from its 
enemies in its free state, nor serve its master in a domestic one. Several have been carried to 
Europe. One was sent as a present to the king of England by the Pacha of Egypt, and ar- 
rived there in 1827 Severd of the southern giraSes (C. awlralia) have recently been exbib-

is peculiarly shrill at the feeding seaeon, 
and it flits along, by short Sights, before

the whole not unlike the shape of s mushroom. Two species of the edentalons mammals, which 

feed npon ants, are also found here, adding one to the other thousand instances of design and 

arrangement which pervades the order of nature. These are the i3anivark {OrycUropiu Co-

CHAPTER LXXV. MAGHREB, OR BARBART. 

I. BowwIaHes. This section, comprising all tbe norlheni part of Africa to the west oftla 
inded on the north by the Siraiis of Gibraltar uid the Mediterranean Sei ; 
h by Sahara ; and west by tbe Atlantic Ocean. It consists of a aimni 
7 along the Mediterranean, and a series of osses along tbe sontbeni bor 
by a mountainous chain called the Atlas Mountains. It is politicillr 
lies, usually called tbe Barbary Powers, and the French colony of Ar 
he territory are also occupied by numerooa independent tribes of Anb 

3. Surface and ClitiuUe. Tbe Atlas Mountains, which traverse tbe whole region from MR 
to west is several ranges, rise to their greatest elevation in Morocco, where some of the lust- 
nits exceed I2,(X)0 feet. The rivers which descend from these mountains reach tbe M 
after a short course, but they fertiliie the plains which they water. On tbe east and south an 
fxtensive deserts, dotted here and there with cultivable and inhabitable wadys or oases. Tbe 
.maritiow region, sheltered from the burning winds of the desert by the mountains, and opes 
to tbe sea breezes, enjoys a pleasant climate. 

3. Productions. The productions of the fertile soil of Barbery are not materially difierest 
lrÂ«m those of southern Europe, the temperature beii^ nearly the same. Wheat mi haAef 
are chiefly cultivated ; beans and lentils are abundant, and in addition to the common fruits a , 
Europe are the date and lotus. 

4. TripoU. This state occupies the most easterly portion of Barbary, and is tbe iinmI 
^vanced in civilization ; it has an area of 370,000 square miles, most of which ia sterile, wilk 
tb*ut 700,000 inhabitants. Tripoli Proper is an arid district, thinly peopled. Barea is iitde 
jDore than a desert. Fezzan is traversed by the Soudah, or Black Mountains, and iu taict 
b general is a desert sprinkled with verdant oases. There is Utile productive soil in any pat 
ef the country, and the cultivation is bad. Dates, maize, and barley are reiKd, sod tpt 
pomegranates, and lemons are abundant. 

Tripoli, the capital, has a good harbor upon the Mediterranean. The streets are strai^ 
and wide, end the houses regular and well built ; the architecture is more European tin 
Arabian, and tbe city is much handsomer than the generality of the Moorish towns. Mioy ol 
ifae houses are of stone, and the courts, mosques, and gates are adorned with marble. Tbs 

Â¥eBt mosque is a magnificent structure, with four cupolas supported by coltnnns uf muUtt

tfiiAi mt i i/ip the oasis cif the same name, it tko a phee of much eonmereial aotivttjr: it 
pmeaU, like sevend other towns of Barbary, the singular spectacle of a small town, iohabilei 
by tvo separate eommunities, who are frequently at w|ur with each other. A cocnmoD vmB 
encloses the whole town, but the space wtthin is divided by an interior wdl into distinct sec- 
tions, occupied by distinct tribes. The two sections communicate by a gate, which is closed 
in lime of war. The commerce of the country ceneiste id the exportation of dates, honej^ 
wax^ madder, skins, oil, salt, saffi*on, gum, feathers, Ac, some of which are brought by caiÂ»* 
vans from the interior. Most of .the commerce is translated at Tripoli. The govemmcat is 
ebsolutCt . . 

6. Tupit. The smallest, but most populous and best cultivated of the Barbary States, 
Tunis, is bounded north by the Mediterranean ; east by the same sea and Tripoli ; aouth by 
the desert ; and west by Algiers. It contains an area of 54,000 square mtles^ with 1,800^000 
infaabitants. A mountainous ridge traverses it from north to south. In the south is a large 
lake, known to the ancients as the Palui Triionii. The climate is heahhy and the soil of the. 
ralleys and the lower part of the mountains is fertile. It is watered by the Mejerda or Ba* 
gradas, a considerable river, and on the coasts are several good harbors. 

Ttmtf, the capital, is one of the best built towns of Africa, yet the streets are narrow and 
dirty, and the booses low and mean. The palace of the bey is a large building in the Moor- 
ish style ; there are several mosques, and a number of schools, and the town is supplied with 
water by an aqueduct. Commerce and manufactures of velvet, silk, and linen, employ 
many of the inhabilants. Population, 100,000. Six miles from the town is GoltUa^ th^ port 
and citadel of Tunis, with an arsenal and ship-yards. In the neighborhood is the site of the 
ancient city of Carthage^ loi^ the mistress of the Mediterranean and the rival of Rome. The 
only remains of this celebrated place are detached fragments, or portions of walb, aqueducts, 
&c. CabtSj on a gulf of the same name in a fertile district, has a good harbor, and 20,000 
mhabitants engaged in commerce and manufactures. CatriMin, in the interior, is the centra 
of an important inland traffic. Its population is about 50,000. 

6. Algiers. This rich wad important territory, until 1830 the seat of a piratical state, is 
now occupied by the French ; its fiue climate, fertile soil, and central situation render it a 
valuable acouisition. 

Jilgieny fonnerly the capital of the state, and now of the French colony, is built upoa the 
declivity of a hill in the form of an amphitheatre ; the hari>or is good, the streets narrow, and 
the houses low, with flat roofs. The principal public buildings are the palace of the d^, 
consmting of two large courts, surrounded by large buildings, and adorned with spacious mar- 
ble colonnades; the dsbami or principal mosque ; the bai racks, which are the handsomest 
edifices in the town, and are decorated with marble and adorned with fountains ; the bagnm^ 
or prisons in which the slaves were shut up at night, and the bazars. The last dey resided in 
the Cassaba or citadel, a strong fortre^, in the vaults of which the French' seised dK>ut tea 
miUions of d<Sllars. The population of Algiers is now about 30,000. 

Oran^ on the coast, with about 10,000 inhabitants, has a good harbor. Boaa, to the east 
of Algiers, with 10,000 inhabitants, is in the province of Constantina. Con^nntina is the 
largest town of this part of Africa. It lies 20 days' march to the southeast of Algiers, and the 
intervening tract is uninhabited. Population, 50,000. Bugtiah between Constantina and 
Algiers, has a good harbor and rich iron mines. The Cabyles in this vicinity are remarkable 
for their fierce disposition and warlike habits. Trtmtctn is the principal town in the prov- 
ince of Oran ; it has about 20,000 inhabitants, who carry on some mamifactures. Mtdta^ in 
the fertile proviace of Tittery, and Blida or Belydahy delightfuDy situated in a productive 
dbtrict, are %Bportant towns. 

Algiers f(lilierly had a considerable trade in the exportation of com, dates, silks, copper, 
handkerchiei% rugs, feathers, &c. The manufactures are carpets, silk, cotton, woolen, 
leather, and coarse linen. The French had, previous to the revolution, formed establish* 
mems upon several parts of the coast for commerce and the fishii^ of coral ; but these were 
broken 4ip by the late wars. Till this period most of the maritime trade was in the hands of 
a French company at Marseilles. The populatimi is 2,000,000. 

This petty state has long been infamous for its piracies. Until the present century all the 
nations trading to the Mediterranean were aubjected to an anninil tribute in order to protect their 
commerce from plunder and their cifizeni from slavery. A severe blow was struck at their 
naval power by the American and finglish fleeu, in 1816. The French goveramant in 1889t

Algiers, io.tbe autumn of that year. Tbe province may now be considered as a coloujot 
France. 

7. Empbrt of Mmroeco or Mor^ciQ* This Statei bordering upon the Atlantic Oceso ni 
dw'Mediterraneaa Sea, is highly favored by nature in its mild climate, fertile soil, and advu* 
C^;eou8 position upon 2 seas ; but bad govemoient and civil discord have deprived it of the 
hmfit of its natural advantages. It hat an area of 175,000 square mile^, with 6,000,000 io* 
habitants. It comprises the Ign^doms of Morocco, Fez, 8ux, Tafilet, aiid some other pror- 
inces ; but many of the tribes, within these limits, are entirely independent, and oftea at wa 
with the government of Morocco, and with each other. 

JUoroteo or Jtfaroeeo, the capital, is a krge town, situated in a fertile and elevated plain, b 
dM rear of which rise the hij^iest sommiils of Mount Atlas. It b much reduced, but still 
e<Mitains many sumptuous edifices, which aues4 its former splendor. The imperial palace, cod- 
flbting of numerous pavilions, courts, and gardens, covers a space 4,500 feet long, b; U800 
broad ; one of the mosques is distinguished for its lofty minaret, 220 feet high, |Lod seveni 
others are remarkable for their size ; tbe vast building, called Bel- Abbas, comprises, io iti 
precincts, a sanctuary, a mosque, a mausoleum, and a hospital, which accommodates 1,500 
patients. Tbe great morocco manufactory, tbe granaries, &c., are also worthy of notice. 
Population, 70,000. 

Fez^ tbe capital of the province of that name, is the largest city in the empire. It stands 
on the slopes of several hills, and is watered by a river. Tbe streets are narrow ; the bouses 
are of brick or stone, and often adorned outwardly with mosaic work. The roofs are flat, mi 
many have high towers, decorated with carving and gilding. There are 200 mosques io the 
city, and 2 colleges. The place was once a famous seat of learning, and the metropolis of the 
Maliometan faith in the West. Almost all the houses have fountains, which are supplied with 
water by canals from tbe river. The markets are excessively crowded, and the Arabs of tbe 
surrounding regions resort hither for all their supplies. Population, 80,000. 

Mtquintz has frequently been the residence of the Sultans, who have here a handsome oal- 
Â«S8. The eiiy is surroumled by a triple line of walls, 15 feet high, and resembles the otbet 
Moorish towns. The inhabitants are esteemed more polished and hospitable than those of (be 
other cities. On one side, stands a quarter inhabited by negroes. The surrounding couotiy 
is fertile, and well cultivated. Population, 60,000. 

Mogodar is a seaport oo the Atlantic. It is built in a flat, sandy desert. The houses are 
of white stone, and make a fine appearance from the sea. The harbor is shallow, and is de- 
Itnded by 2 batteries. There is considerable commerce carried on with the north of Europe, 
and America. Population, 10,000. SaUte^ a seaport oo the Atlantic, has been famous lor 
ita piracies. It stands at the mouth of a river, and is defended by a wall and battery. There 
me many commercial houses established here by Europeans, but the trade is declining, m con- 
sequence of the filling up of the harbor. Population, 20,000. Toiifter is a* seaport, just 
within the Straits of Gibraltar. It is tbe residence of many foreign consuls, but h hss htde 
trade. Population, 10,000. 

The commerce of Morocco is chiefly transacted at Mogador, from which place are exported 
goat-skins, oil^ almonds, gums, wax, wool, ostrich feathers, pomegranates, and dates. Tbe 
land-trade, with the Arab arul negro tribes, is carried on by caravans. Tbe manufactures are 
carpets, woolen and cotton cloths, silk, morocco, leather, paper, and saltpetre. 

8. Rihdulgtrid. Biledulgerid, or the Land of DaieSj is a district lying between Tunis aod 
Algiers on the north, and the Great Desert on the south. It is moiwtainous, sandy, and bar- 
ren, producing little vegetation. Some parts, however, are covered with thick groves of ibe 
date palm. The climate is hot and unhealthy. Tbe inhabitants are a mixture of tbe oaure 
Africans and wild Arabs ; tbe former living in small villages, and the latter in tents, totmH^ 
fiom place to place, in quest of plunder. > * 

9. InhabUants, These are principally of 3 great races, 1st. The Moors are of a mi^^ 
origin, being descended from the ancient inhabitants, Arabs, Romans, &c. Their cony)lexioÂ« 
are lighter than those of the Arabs, and they are a well-formed race. 2d. The* Arabs art 
much like those of Asia, and are descended from the original conquerors, and from eroi^nnts 
from Sahara. They are pastoral, and live in tents. 3d. The Berbers are a race d Sep^ 
from the two form^ in language and customs, and, therefore, probably of a difierent orfio 
They are warlike and free. Of these, the chief u-ibes are the Shilloos, in the rooua^sios of 



MAanaB, or usmmby. Â«Â» 

Morocco ; the Ctbyks, t wbhe people, in tbe nouiteiiis of Algiers and Tunis ; tbe Tibbooii 
wd the Tuaricks. 

Tbe Berbers are probabljr tbe original inbabttants of a great part of Nortbem Africa ; sone 
of tbem are quite black, but tbej have not the negro physiognomy. Tbe Jews are also ai^ ' 
â– lerous in the Barbary States, where they are treated with great harshness, and are a general 
object of hatred Â«nd contempt. The Turks are the ruling race in Tunis and Tripoli, as thej 
were in Algiers, until its conquest by tbe French ; but they are not numerous. Beside these 
various races, are the negroes, who are imported from Nigritia, as shves ; in Morocco^ bow* 
ever, they form the standing army of the empire, and the garrisons of tbe fortresses* 

10. dmmerct. With a fertile soil, and a little mamifiicturing indusury, tbe productions of 
the eartb must form the principal articles of export from this region. Barbary, in ancient and 
eren modern times, has been the granary of Europe ; but, as com is not now allowed to bÂ« 
exported, fruits, gums, hides, wax, and morocco, are the chief materials for the maritime 
commerce. Haicks, a species of woolen cloth, always worn by the Moors, when they go 
abroad ; sashes and silk handkerchiefs, carpets, and the conical woolen ca|i6, called skuIl-capS| 
and worn all over Barbary and the Levant, are manufactured, and furnish articles of inland 
traffic. The caravan trade with the interior of Africa, is chiefly carried on from Morocco 
and Tripoli ; tbe caravans carry salt, tobacco, and European goods, and bring back slavesy 
ivory, and gold-dust. 

1 1 . Oavemment, The government of Morocco is an absolute despotism ; but most of tbe 
numerous tribes, which are *found in all parts of Barbary, are governed by their own chie&, 
whose authority is limited, by tbe usages and free spirit of the respective people. Tbe gov* 
eminent of Tunis and Tripoli is also despotic ; the Bey of Tunis, and the Pacha of Tripoli^ 
are nominally dependent upon the Porte, but really independent sovereigns. Tbe mooarchi 
of Morocco claim the crown in the capacity of sheriffs, or descendants of Mahomet ; and 
they attempt to increase the lustre of the regal dignity and the authority of their office, by aaÂ» 
suming the character of doctors, prophets, and saints ; which, however, they seem to regard 
as not inconsristent with die mbst unbounded indulgence of cruelty and sensuality. Tbe, em* 
peror, claining the supremacy in religion, which, in Mahometan countries, includes law, thert 
IS no body that has any check or control over him, but everything depends on his caprice* 
The' Bey of Tunis, m 1816, not only emancipated himself from a dependence on the Porte^ 
but riso got rid of the licentious and turbulent Turkish soldiery. The Pacha of Tripoli, in 
tbe beginning of the present century, was merely a Turkish governor ; but, havbg sei^d all 
the Turkish officers at a feast, he caused them to be strangled, and his adherents then massa* 
cred roost of the Turkish soldiers. Tbe government, though absolute, has been of a mild 
character, and the country has assumed an orderly and civilis^ appearance. 

13. Dress. The complete dress of a Moor, includes a red, pomted cap, with a turban, or 
couon sash, wrapped round it ; a shirt, with wide sleeves ; short, white drawers, of great 
width ; a woolen waistcoat, or a small, cloth jacket ; a silk or woolen sash, and yellow slip- 
pers. The legs are always bare* Tbe haick is a universal garment ; it is a piece of cloth, 6 
elk k)ng, and 1 i broad, thrown over the shoulder, and fastened around the waist. Many Moors 
wear the caftan, a loose coat, reaching to the knee. The females dress loosely, and encumber 
themselves with ear-rings, bracelets, and rings on the ankles. They dye tbe hair, feet, and 
fioger-nftils, a deep saffron-color, with henna. The only paint they use for the face, is white* 

13. Language. The common languages are the Turkish, the Hebrew, and the Arabic ; 
the latter predominates, though it is not spoken with purity. 

14. Manner of Building. Generally, the houses are nidely and unskilfully built. They 
are square, with flat roofs, and an open area, or court, within, in which the cooking is perform- 
ed, for there are no chimneys. There are few windows. In some cities, tbe bouses are 
mostly whitewashed. The pastoral tribes dwell in tents, shaped like an inverted boat. In tbe 
mountains of Tripoli, there are subterranean villages, with wells and space for cattle. They 
ire 80 constructed, that they can stand a siege. 

15. Fbo4 and Drink. The chief articles of food are bread, mutton, poultry, flph, butteri 
cheese, oil, olives, and fruits. Little beef is used. The common dish is the Kouskousou^ a 
kind of paste made of meal, formed into small rolls, and placed in a colander over tbe x^f^ 
of a kettle, in which meat is boiling. The common people add to it milk or butter, tbe rich 
a nourishing broth. Coffee used to be as general as in the East, but of late years it has bees 
superseded by the use of tea, which is now given to visiters at all hours. -Wines and spiritSi

though forbidden in the Koran, are drunk when they can be obtained, to excess. TbedoAi 
on opium are so great, that few use it ; but an extract is made from a narcotic phot, perfaap 
a kind of (lax, which exhilarates without intoxicating. Tobacco is somewhat used in smoki^ 
' and as snuflf. 

16. Diseases. Blindness is common, and the phgue has sometimes nearly depopuM 
cities. The general means adopted for cure is by charms, amulets, &c. 

17. Traveling. In the interior viMages, a house is set apart for strangers, with a proper 
officer to furnish one night's entertainment. In the cities, there are no mns. The geoinl 
mode of traveling is with mules, horses, or camels. 

18. i haraclerj Manners^ arui Customs. The Moors of Barbary have been very prombid 
in Europe for cruelly, indolence, ignorance, and fanaticbm. If the country does not derive its 
name fiom its barbarous inhabitants, the name is nevertheless equally well deserved ootb 
account. The inhabitants, except those of towns, are divided into tribes or clans, which are 
often at war, and which offer insuperable obstacles to civilization. They pass an active Efe) 
and are hardy and warlike. The inhabitants of cities carry indolence to a Turkish extreme. 
In Morocco, and other western cities, where men meet in the street, to converse, tbey fortih 
with seat themselves on mats, and the streets are often filled with these groups* A shopkeeper 
arranges his wares so that he can reach any of them without leaving bis seat, and the vetj 
watchman performs guard-duty in a sitting posture. I'he people of Tunis and Tripoli are tk 
least barbarous. The name of Algerine conveys to us the idea of a ferocious and bigoted 
savage ; but Mr. Shaler, who has lived in Algiers many years, represents the people as insii* 
uating, courteous, and without much fanaticism, though not without humanity. Thejire, 
however, like their ancestors, inconstant and treacherous. The common salutation io Bv* 
bary is, '' Peace be with you." Merchandise is measured by the arm, from the elbow. Tbi 
females when they would honor a person, as the emperor, raise sudden and piercing shrieks, 
and the manners and customs, generally, are those of a very rude state of society. % 

The Jews in Barbary are a numerous and much oppressed class. The bouse of a Jew, 
and all its sacred relations, is open to every Moor who will violate it. A Jew maj be beatea 
by men, and pelted by boys. When riding he is forced to dismount, if he meet a Moor; (o 
make bumble obeisance to one of distinction, and to walk with bare feet in cities. Even tk 
fenaales are compelled to do this. The Jews perform most of the trades, and monopolize tie 
eommferce. They form the only industrious class in cities. In no other country are tbeyn 
mucb depressed as in IMorocco ; yet here they are distinguished for being well formed, wi 
&e females are considered as some of the most beautiful in the world. 

The Arabs chiefly occupy the plains, and they exhibit the same pastoral and roigrato; 
habits, the same simplicity of manners, and the same union of hospitality and pliioder, tha 
eharacterize their countrymen in Arabia ; they live in tents, a number of which forms a camp 
under a sheik, and several camps often acknowledge a chief, called emir. 

Some of the Berbers or Brebers have the same migratory habits as the Arabs ; tbeirlboi 
consists of earners milk and dried camel's flesh, that animal constituting their sole wealth. 
They wear woolen gowns, which cover but a part of the body, and sometimes leather caftw 
and shirts. Rush mats form their beds, and their tents are made of camePs hair, or a coarse 
woolly substance, obtained from the date palm. Others cultivate the earth, and are stadonaij 
in their habits. The Berbers, although Mahometans, do not scrupulously follow all the ordi- 
nances of their religion ; thus they drink wine and eat pork. The Maraboots are a sort Â« 
priests or saints, who are looked upon with great veneration by the Berbers ; thej often exarj 
cise great authority, and maintain a considerable military force. They alone understaw 
Arabic, and can interpret the Koran. 

19. Amusements. There are many equestrian exercises, for all the Moors are roiicb attaco- 
ed to horses, and an Emperor of Morocco, improving on the example of his brother of RoÂ»^Â» 
declared some of his horses saints ! The riders use a bit that will stop the horse in an iiÂ»t^Â» 
when |;oirig at full speed. A Moor will spur his fleet horse at full speed towards a wall, Â«Hi 
when It seems that both must be killed by the collision, the animal is stopped within a jc* 
inches of the barrier. Other amusements are juggling, exhibitions of dancing, story-ieÂ»"fÂ» 
and, about Tunis, hawking is practised. 

20. Education. To read in the Koran, and to write, are the ends of education in roost 
Mahometan countries. Education is often advanced thus fiar in Barbary. The KofW* 
bowever, is sometimes committed to memory, and the reader goes over it Uke a parrot, ti^

ittte aid from the characters. Boys at school have a board and piece of chalk, with which 
hejr wnte ; and they instructed each other long before the time of Lancaster. 

21 . â€¢Srts, No art but that of music receives encouragement. There are some pretty airs. 
tnd the common instruments are a rude hautboy, the pipe, tabor, mandoline, and drum. The 
sciences, which anciently formed the glory of the Moors, are now extinct in this region ; phi* 
osophical instruments of excellent construction are still seen, but they are shown only as 
curious relics, and even medicine is practised by physicians, whose skill reaches little further 
ihan to dress a wound. 

22. Religion, This is the Mahometan. In Barbary saints are common, and to be one 
is a kind of profession or trade. There is at Fez a religious foundation, for the support and 
burial of storks and cranes, which are supposed to be animated by the souls of men. The 
marriages are attended with rejoicing ; the bride is carried home in a cage, placed on a mule 
attended by music. Four wives are allowed, but polygamy is not general. Divorces are 
easy to be obtained by the husband ; and the wife is entitled to one ; the third time she may 
be cursed by her husband. For the first curse, he must pay her eight ducats, and a rich dress 
for the second. A neglect to provide for the wife, is also a ground for divorce.' At burials, 
a concourse attends, and the women howl fearfully. Some are hired to tear their faces, and 
utter lamentations. The dead are dressed as when they lived, and the tombs and graves are 
neatly kept. 

23. Laies, The administration of justice is in none of these States in favor of the innocent. 
The maxim seems to be, that it is better that the innocent should suffer, than the guilty escape. 
The cadis are the judges, and the execution immediately follows conviction, or sentence. 
Small offences are punished by the bastinado ; great ones by burning alive, which is chiefly 
inflicted on JevVs and Christians ; and by impalement and tenter hooks, on the Moors. The 
tenter hooks project from walls, and the culprit is thrown upon them, where he drops from 
one to another, and sometimes lingers in agony for hours. In impalement, a stake is thrust 
longitudinally through the body. The western Moors sometimes punish crimes by tying the 
criminal between two boards, and sawing him asunder lengthways, beginning at the head. 
Women are sometimes tied in a sack and drowned. At Algiers the post of executioner is 
one of honor ; at Morocco it is a dangerous and infan^ous office. In the former city, this 
oflicer of the law may aspire to a place m the state.* 



* *" I Mw a great conconrae offoldiera , and on inqairing 
tbs 0aiiM, found that an execution was about to take plaoeÂ« 
and aome malefacton were at the tame tiin^to be maim- 
ed. The governor ax rived at thia moment, and the pris- 
oners were driven in Â¥ iih their handa tied ; the order for 
ffiiihment was read by the cadi or judoe, and the cul- 
Mils told to prepare themselves, whicii thejr did by saj- 
tmgt Bi el AUak Shed a Mohammed RomooL JilUk and 
wonhippinfT. They were then made to sit down in a 
ItDe open their lefls on the eround ; a butcher then came 
forward with a sharp kniie in his hand ; he seized the 
first in the line on tne left, by the beard, with his left 
iMnd ; two men were at the same time holding the prisÂ« 
oner's hands; the botcher began cutting very leisorelv 
with his knife round the neck, (which was a very thick 
one,) and kept cutting to the bones until the flesh was 
sepafiled ; he then shoved the head violently firom side 
to Mde, cutting in wKh the point of the knife to divide 
the sinews, which he seemed to search out among the 
stremros of blood, one by one ; he fihally got the heM off 
and threw it on a mat that was spread to receive the ma- 
tilated limbs of the others. There were eight more, who 
were senti*nced to lose a lev and an arm eachÂ» and nine 
to lose onlv one arm. The butcher began to amputate the 
legÂ» at the knee joint, by cutting the flesh and sinews round 
with his knife, which he sharpen^ from time to time on 
a stone; he would then part the joint by breaking it short 
over his knee, as a butcher would part the joint in the 
leg of an ox. Having in this manner got off the leg, and 
thrown it on the mat, he proceeded to take off the arm at 
tiw eftow, in the same leumrely and clumsy manner ; he 
seeoed, however, to improve by practice, so that he carv- 
ed off the hands of the last eight at their wrists, in a very 
sboft time, -^ this done, they next proceeded to take up 
the arteries, and apply a plaster, which was soon aocom- 
afcshed by dipping the stumps into a ksttle of boiling 



pitch that stood near, or something that had the same 
appearance and smell. Is not this last circumstance as 
improvement in surgerv ? They then carried the lifeless 
trunk and mutilated bodies, with the bead and other 
limbs, to the market ; the head and limbs were carried on 
a mat by six men, who were making as much sport as 
possible, for the spectators ; the bodies were thrown across 
jackasses, and they were exposed in the most public part 
of the market place, nearly the whole day. The two 
governors, and other officers who were present during the 
execution of the sentence, were sitting on the ground 
next to the wall, appearing quite unconcerned, and were 
conversing gayly on other subjects. The Moors, who 
came from mere cariosity, did not show the least mark 
of disapprobation, or any signs of horror ; they jested 
with the butcher, who seemed highly gratified with the 
part he was acting. 

** I now asked fiais bel Cossim, who attended me, con- 
cerning the mode of procuring an executioner, &c., At, 
He told me, that when sn ormr came to execute or maim 
any culprits, it generally embraced several at the same 
time, so as to make but one job of it ; that the butchers 
were called upon by the alcayd or governor, and forced 
to find one out of their, number to do this work ; that thej 
then made up a purse agreeably to a rule, made among 
themselves in such cases ; that is, two and a half ducats 
per man for cutting off heads, and two ducats per maa 
for maiming ; (two and a half ducats make one oollar, oc 
forty cents per ducat ;) they then question each other to 
know who will accept of the money, and do the job ; if 
no one tppews willinff, they cast lots, snd the one on 
whonk it rails, is obliged to undertake it. This man is pro- 
tected by the governor for twenty-four hours aAer the 
execution, when be is left to take care of himself, brave 
the public odium, and the revenge of the friends of tho 
soffersri or else to fly ; hs generally goes off the first

empire of the Saracens began to crumble, it formed several separate kingdnras, which, fbr 
more than 3 centuries, have been sinking deeper and deeper into ignorance and barbarisni. Ia 
the 15th century, the celebrated Turkish pirates, Barbsrossa and Huyraddtn, seized upon Al- 
giers, Tunis, and Tripoli, and made them dependencies of the Turkish empire, and Trom tbd 
time they devoted themselves to general piracy. In the* beginning of the present century, 
Tunis and Tripoli freed themselves from the Turkish yoke ; but the flagrant piracies of Algiers, 
drew upon ber tbe vengeance first of the United Stales, and afterward of England and Franca. 

CHAPTER LXXVI. SAHARA, OR GREAT DESERT. 

This great waste extends from the Atlantic to the Nile-valley, and from the Barbary Smo 
to Senegsmhia and Nigritia. It stretches from latitude )6Â° to 30Â° North, and from loi^pMi 
39Â° East to 1 1Â° West, having a length of about 3,000 miles, a breadth of 800, and sn vtM of 
about 1,600,000 square miles. Tbe eastern part is often called the Desert of Libya, wui* 
may be considered as forming a part of a great desert zone of sand and naked A>ck9, wtuok, 
with few and slight inlerruplions, reaches from the Atlantic Ocean, over Central Asia, to '^ 
borders of China, through 130 degrees of loi^itude. Sahara consists of a table-land, rsueda 
little above the level of the sea, covered with moving sand, and here and there containing some 
rocky heights and valleys, where the water collects and nourishes some thorny shru'iis, ferns, 
and grass. Along tbe shore of the Atlantic, are some mountains in detached peaks ; towards 
the interior, the heights lose themselves in a plain, covered with white and sharp pebbles. For 
I great part <A the year, tbe dry, heated air, has an appearance of a reddish vapor, and tba

trees, are met witfa here and (bare. On ibÂ« southern border, are forests of green trees. Sonta 

ntoekeyt and gaieJles support themselves OD the scanly regetation. Numerons flocks of oa- 

tncbes are also fomd here. Liooa, pantbera, and serpents, add to the hoirora of these fri^btfifl 

solitudes. The animals live almost wilboat 

drink. The flocks consist of camels, goats, 

and sheep. 

The coast contains some good harbors, as 
tbe Rio do Ouro, and the harbor of St. Cyp 
rian. Here is Cape Bojador, the terror of 
the navigators of the middle age, and down to 
tbe year 1 553, ibe fatal limit of all voyages in 
this direction. Cape Blanco, a little fnrther 
I south, is thought to be the southern limit of 

the Carthaginian discoveries. 

Tbe mannw of traveling, is with camels ; 

1 and every traveler, or, indeed, every Arab, 

is consuntly armed, for the tribes generally 

live in that state of pillage and warlare, ibal 

mark tbe descendants of Ishmael. Tbe 

Killing a Pmttirr, camel, only, of all domesticated animals, 

â–  finds a support in the scanty vegetation of a 

few spob in the desert. A common camel can easily travel 100 miles in a day. The eara- 

nms from Morocco t^e 130 days to cross tbe deiert, 54 of which are traveling days, and (he 

Mbers spent at (he different stations, in rest. Tbe desert is a shifting sea of sand ; there is 

ott track, and there are few landmarks. Drought, or clouds of sand, often itestroy travelers. 

In 1805, a caravan of l,SOO camelij, and 2,000 people, perished from drought, as there was no 

water at the usual wadeys. Caravans of traders cross this immense desert, from the Barbary 

States to Centre) Africa. Tbe only animals capable of beit>g employed in this service, are 

canaels, which, from their ability to travel many days without water, are admirably fitted for these 

jowneys. A few spots, scattered here and there, afford, occasionally, a pool or stream of 

water, and a grove of palm trees. These ere 

called wadeyg, or watering-places. 

No part of the earth's surface seems so un- 
fit for tbe support of human life, as the great 
Desert of Sahara ; yet it is inhabited by many 
roving tribes of Arabs, Moors, Tuaricks, and 
Tibboos. Existence, here, is a constant 
struggle with hardship end want. The inhab- 
itants are composed of Arabs and their negro 
slaves. The Arabs are of a reddish, copper 
color, and tbey are hardy enough to endure, 
without murmuring, the frequent extremes of 
want, to which their silualion exposes them. 
They are lean, but strong. Their eyes are 
black and piercing, their hair and beard black, 
(heir cheek bones prominent, and their nosei 
AWmdty. aquiline. The old women are represented as 

ugly beyond all comparison, while the yomi| 
ire not deficient in beauty. Tbey take great pains to make the eye teeth project beyond the 
others, and (be lip is often held up by (hem ; ibis gives to s sharp and wrinkled face, a'fero- 
cioMs exprpssion. The dress consists chiefly in a piece of coarse camel's hair cloth, or a goat 
tkin, tied round (he middle, and there is no covering for tbe feet or head. The language iÂ« 
tbe Arvbic. Tbe dwellings are movable tents, covered with a coarse cloih of goal's hair, or 
camel's hair ; and there is no furniture, but a few rude dishes, utensils, and mats to sleep on

varf riob milk. The Arabs, howetrer, suffer greatly firom scaieiqr of food and watery mim 
often reduced to Wve on what will barely support life. In some parts, dates, eiiUet, naise, 
and gum are general articles of food. In an atmosphere perfectly dry, and with a maiMMr of 
life so simple, there can be few diseases ; and the Arabs, whp do not fall by tbe sword, geie- 
rally die m extreme old age. The Arabs are high-spirited, rapacious, perfidious, and rtf&ag^ 
fill ; yet, within certain limits, hospitable and compassionate; â€” they have, howe?er, docobh 
passion for a Christian, and it is chiefly from the unfortunate, ill-treated, shipwrecked niarjner, 
that we are acquainted with them. They are quick and sagacious, abore all other barbarins, 
and they have a great pride of independence ; feeling contempt for any people, \i ho submit ta 
organized governments. The lot of a Christian, cast in this inhospitable coast, is deplonble. 
He is seized, stripped, and perhaps wounded, or killed, by the cimitars of those who light om 
him for his absolute possession. The master of the captive is uncommonly merciful, if ht 
allows his slave a remnant of his own clothing. Generally, the captives have to bear, on their 
naked bodies, the burning force of the sun, and they have liltle shelter or covering in tbe cold 
dews of night. They are forced to run beside the camels, in the long and constant marches 
of the tribes, â€” or, if permitted to ride, it is hardly a desirable change. The Arabs have so 
little food themselves, that frequently nothing is given to the Christian slaves, who mustdRiT 
famine, if they cannot support nature by a few snails and bitter herbs. Of late yearS)dAh 
wrecked mariners have generally been sold to persons who carry them, for redemptioii|toKH 
gadore. The negro slaves are treated well ; eating of the same food, tmd sleeping i$ tke 
same mat, with their masters. Where life is a constant struggle with want, there is offitaiHh 
disposition for amusement, and there is little in the desert. Drafts and chess, boweM^tfe 
sometimes played. 

Education is confined to reading the Koran, and the schools are generally kept by the toftei) 
or priests. Tbe religion is so stiictly Mahometan, in spirit and practice, that there boo 
human sympathy for any suffering of a Christian or Jew. Hospitality, however, is tbe firtne 
of the desert ; and one Arab, who throws himself in a village, upon the protection of the tribe, 
is certain of security and entertainment, though his hosts might have robbed him, bad tbejr met 
him in their excursions. The government is that of sheiks or chiefs, who are elected, or as- 
sume the power, that superior courage or sagacity confers. 

The eastern part of the desert is chiefly occupied by the Tibboos, a Berber race, who owa 
^at herds of camels^and plunder the unlucky travelers, whom they encounter. Their county 
contains numerous salt lakes, and yields large quantities of that valuable mineral, in wbicb sone 
of the Tibboos now carry on a profitable trafiic with Nigritia. In the central part, are tbe 
Tuaricks, also a Berber nation, oome of their oases contain considerable* towns. Tbe Tua* 
ricks are often engaged as guides to the caravans, as agents for foreign merchants, and some- 
times become tradera themsdves. 

CHAPTER LXXVII. NIGRITIA, SUDAN, OR LAND OF THE BLACK& 

1 . Boundaries^ &c. This is an extensive region, which derives its name from the color of its 
mhabitants, comprising numerous powerful States, and large tracts of country imperfectly 
known. It lies between 6^ and 16^ north latitude, and between 32Â° east and 8Â° west 
longitude, having the Desert of Sahara on the north ; Nubia and Abyssinia on the east ; the 
unknown regions of Central Africa. and Guinea on tbe south ; and Senegambia on tbe west 
It is about 2,600 miles in length, by 600 in breadth, and has an area of 1.500,000 sqoir6 
miles. 

2. Rivers. The Mger^ which traverses a great part of this country, has been, for a grei! 
number of years, an object of uncommon interest, and speculative and practical research. Its 
origin, and a part of its course, have been known to the world for many centuries, but it5 ter- 
mination remained undiscovered ; and the researches of travelers, combined with tbe tbeontf 
and conjectures of geographers, only established the fact, that a great river of Central Afncfc 
nsing in the mountains of Western Guinea, flowed eastward into unknown regions. Tbe ddosj 
elaborate hypotheses were framed, to account for its termination. By some, it was sapposeo 
to be swallowed up in the sands of the desert. By others. It was imagined to flow into vast 
hkes, having no outlet, where its waters were dissipated by evaporation. Other theories coo* 
aected it with tbe Nile of Egypt, the Zaire of Congo, and the streams flowing into tlie Bign 



^Bntin. The celebrated Mungo Park lost his lire in the attempt to travel along the sueam 
10 its terminstion, and various other expedilions, deapaiched for a similar purpose, failed of 
their object. The great question seemed to be shrouded in impenetrable mystery, when in 
' 1630 the discovery was effected by Richard and Johu Lander, the former of whom had been 
the attendant of Captain Clapperton upon the journey in which be died. These two travelera 
proceeded b; land from the coast, to Boossa on the Niger, and following the course of the 
stream downwards, reached the Atlantic Ocean in November, 1830, through the channel of 
ibe river Nun, flowing into the Bight of Benin. This channel is one of the numerous mouths 
of the Niger which intersect the country, forming a delta 240 mites in extnnt along the coast.* 
3. Laket, The discoveries of late English travelers have made known to the world a large 
lake of fresh water called the Tchad, in the eastern part of Nigrilia. It lies in about 14Â° N. 
latitude and 15Â° E. longitude, and was first seen by Dr. Oudeney and his companions. It 
was first visited by Major Denliam, who traveled along a great part of its borders, but was ob- 
liged to leave 140 miles of it unexplored. He was informed that it had no outlet. His approach 
to it is thus described. " By sunrise I was on the borders of the lake, armed for the destruc- 
tion of the multitude of birds, who, all uncon- 
scious of my purpose, seemed, as it were, to 
welcome our arrival. Flocks of geese and wild 
ducks of a most beautiful plumage were qui- 
etiy feeding within half pistol shot of where I 
stood, and not being a very keen or inhuman 
sporlsiDBn, for the terms appear to me to be 
synonymous, my purpose of deadly warfare 
was almost shaken. As I moved towards 
them ihey only changed their places a little to 
the right or left, and appeared to have no idea 
of the hostility of my intentions. All this was 
really so new, that 1 hesitated to abuse the 
confidence with which they regarded me, and 
very quietly sat down to contemplate the sceiih 
before me. Pelicans, cranes four or five feet 
Tchad lAiiÂ». jj^ height, gray, variegated and while, were 

scarcely so many yards from my side, and a bird between a snipe and a woodcock, usembling 
both, and larger than either ; immense spoonbills of a snowy whiteness, widgeon, teal, yellow-

Jfoveinber, and ceases aUo with tornadoes. 

5. AliiieraU. Many parts of tliis country are productive m gold ; but it does not ffat 
Ibat any mines have been wrought by tbe negroes. After the annual inundations bavtnb- 
<ide<l, great numbers of people are employed in collecting the mud brought down \Â» it 
jlreaina from the mountains. By an operation somewhat tedious, tbe small psrtiHes of gold 
generally called gold dial are separated from tbe mud and sand ; this is done by repetttd 
washings the labor of which is performed by women. 

6. JiaturiU Prodv cliotu. ISigrilia, tike all tropical countries, abounds in fruits ; but it seemi 
to be deficient in several of the species, which are found elsewhere, in the same tidtÂ«lt- 
Park did not observe, here, either tbe sugar-cane, the coffee, or the cocoa. The pine^ipplt 
was likewise unknown. The few orange and banana trees, near the coast, were supposed tn 
JuvB been intioduced by tbe Portuguese. The most remarkable productions of this coudiiJ', 
â€¢re the htm, which furnishes the negroes with a sweet liquor and a son of bread ; the iW,4 
Vee like an oak, tbe fruit of which, dried in the sun and boiled in water, yields a specin of 
Â«egeuhle butler, which Park thought auperior to that of cow's milk ; various giim-beuif 
Ireet, and the gooroo, or Sudan nut, called by tbe Arabs tbe Sudan coffee, are also vilulili 
4nea.

,j Mf. Park gives tis the following account, 

J in his first expedition to Africa ; â€” ** Aa we 

I were crossing a large open plain, where there 

were a few scaliered bushes, my guide, who 
was a little way before me, wheeled his horse 
round in a moment, calling out something id 
the Foulab language, which 1 did not under- 
stand. I inquired, in Mandingo, what hs 
Park MtttmÂ£ tkt lion, meant; nava bit-i bilti (a very large lionj, 

said he, and made signs for me to ride away ; 
but my horse was too much fatigued ; so we rode slowly past the bush, Irom nhich the ani* 
inal bad given us the alarm. Not seeing anything myself, however, I thought my guide bad 
been niiataken, when the Foulah suddenly put bJs hand to bis mouih, exclaiming Sintbak an 
allalu, (God preserve us !) and, to my great surprise, I then perceived a large red lion, at a 
sliori distance from the bush, with his head crouched between bis fore paws, 
would instantly spring upon m 
ly pulled my feet from Ihe i 
myself on the ground, tliat 
become the victim, rather (I 
il is probable the lion was r 

Sruielly suffered us to pass, 
airly wilhjn his reach. My 
; eted upon this sovereign of b< 
t it impossible to remove them, uutil we were 
, at a considerable distance." 

Thai beautiful animal, the Giraffi, or Camt- 

Ilopard, is also common, according to the follow- 
ing relation of Deqfaam ; â€” "On the llth, ws 
arrived at Showy, after a very tedious march) 
and losing our way for 3 hours.; the woods are, 
indeed, most intricate and difficult ; and, aa 
Girafc. all the Shouaas bad moved up towards Barca 

Gana, we could get no guides. We saw 5 
Giraffet to-day, to my great delight ; they 
were the Grst I bad seen alive, and. notwith- 
standing my fatigue and the beat, Belial and 
myself chased them for half an hour ; we kept 
within about 20 yards of them. They have t 
I very extraordinary appearance, from their be- 

ing so low" behind, and move awkwardly, drag- 
ging, as il were, their hinder legs after them ; 
, they are not swift, and are unlike any figure at 
, I ihem I ever met with." 

I The Hippripotamm is also found here, m 

^ great numbers ; and a remarkable trait in ibeii 

1 manners, is thus described by the same trÂ»Â» 

eler; â€” *' It was intended, this evening, lo

lull opportunity of coDvincIng ourselves, thut these uncouth and slupendous aDimils ire 
very sensibly attracted by musical sounds, even though they should not be of ihe soliat 
kind ; â€” as we passed along the borders of Lake Muggaby, at sunrise, they followed Ok 
dnuDs of the dinerent chiefs the nbole length of the water, sometimes approaching so close 
to the shore, that the water they spouted from their mouths, reached the persons nbo irere 
passing along the banks. I counted IS at one time, sporting on the surface ; and my semm, 
Columbus, shot one of them in the head, when he gave so loud a roar, as he burled bimself in 
the lake, that all the others disappeared in an instant." The elephants of this country are ex- 
ceedingly fierce ; they are sometimes seen in droves of 150 together. Panthers, leopards, 
and antelopes, ere also natives of this country. Reptiles are numerous. 

8. Bomou. The kingdom of Bornou appears to be the most important of the soveretgaiiei, 
.respecting which we have any distinct knowledge. It Is bounded on the north by Khanein aod 
(he Desert ; on the east, by Lake Tchad ; on the south, by Mandara and Loggun ; and on tbe 
west, by Houssa. It lies between 10^ ai.d 15Â° N. latitude, and 12Â° and 18Â° E. longitude. 
The whole country is flat, and ihe greater part is covered with thick underwood, high, coarse 
grass, and parasitical plants. The towns are, in general, well built, surrounded by walls, 30ar 
40 feel in height, and 20 feet thick. Â£011^ is the capital, and Bimie is the residence of ibe 
tultan. 

The other towns are Old BimU, Kavka, and Angomou. At Kouka, Beoham aod Clip-

, portalioD of gold-dust, staves, horses, ostrich-feathers, salt, and civet. The slaves are pro- 
cured from the neighboring districts to the south, where a regular system of slave-huating u 
carried on. The Bornouese manufacture the iron, which their country produces, into lude 
tools. Of their hemp, they make a sort of coarse lioeo ; and of cotton, a kind of cloth, vbicb 
is dyed blue, and highly valued. They also manufacture carpets, for coverings to Iheir horses 
and tents, of wool, and the hair of camels and goats. They trade with Tripoli and Feoaa, 
by caravans, which proceed across the desert. It was in this direction, that Denham and 
Clapperlon penetrated to the country, and gave the first distinct information of it to the wortd- 

Bomou abounds in domestic animals, such as cows, sbeep, goats, and horses, camels and 
buffaloes. Bullocks are a medium of trade for everything ; and 100 or 150 of tbem are giro 
for a good horse. Abundance of fowl are reared, and hives of bees are extremely plentiful- 
No vegetables are raised, except onions ; nor any fruit, save a few limes. A species of sauU 
grain, called gussub, is cultivated, which is boiled to a paste, and eaten with melted fat. 

The population was estimated, by Denham, at 5,000,000 ; and when that traveler vrsiied 
the country, the sultan had an army of 30,000 cavalry, and 9,000 infantry. The appeanoce 
of a body of these troops, is thus described, in his approach to the capital. " 1 rode siill on- 
wards, and on approaching a spot less thickly planted, was not a little surprised 10 see, m frooi 
of me, a body of several thousand cavalry drawn up in a line, and extending right and left, u

of Â« widfl apreadiDg acacia. The Bomou troops remained quite steady, without ooise or con- 
ItisioD i and a few horsemen who were moving about in the front giving directions, were ths 
onl; persons out of the ranks. On the Arahs appearing in sight, a shout or yell was given by 
the sheik's people which rent the air ; a blast was blown from their rude inslrunients of music 
equally loud, and they moved on to meet Boo Khaloom and his Arabs. There was an ap- 
pearance of tact and management in their movements which astonished me ; 'three separata 
small bodies from the centre and each flank kept changing rafiidly towards us, to within a few 
feet of our horses' heads, without checking the speed of their own, until tb 
halt, while the whole body moved onwards. These parties were mounted 
perfect horses, who stopped and wheeled from their utmost speed, with g 
exactness." 

9. Begharmi. This Is a large and fertile region, lying between Darfoc 
Bomou on the north. On the north it is hounded hy deserts of dry sand, f

12. Fkliattth Eiiigdom. This territory lies west of Bomou, and comprises Houssa, Zeg- 
ceg, Kano, Cashna, and other districts more or less in subjection to the Fellatahs, a warlike 
and predatory nation. The counUy is watered by the Yeou. KanOy in a highly cultivated 
and populous district, contains from 30,000 to 40,000 inhabitants, of whom a great proportion 
â€¢re slaves ; it is famed all over Central Africa for dyeing cloth, and it is the commercial em- 
porium of Central Africa. The neeroes here are exceedingly polite and ceremonious* The 
district of Ctukna is separated from Kano hy a stream flowing to the west ; its capital is noted 
for its fairs, which make it a commercial entrepot between Egypt and Fezzan, and Southern 
Pltgrilia ; the chief articles of trade are slaves and salt. 

The city of SoccatoOy (he capital of the Fellatah dominions, stands on the river, dividing 
Cashna from Kano, and is thus described by Clapperion. " It occupies a long ridge which 
slopes gendy toward the north, and appeared to me the most populous town I had visited in 
the interior of Africa, for unlike most other towns in Houssa, where the houses are thinly 
scattered, it is laid out in regular, well-built streets. The houses approach close to the walls, 
wfaich were built by the present sultan in 1S13, the old walls being too confined for the in- 
creasing population. The wall is between 20 and 30 feet high, and has 12 gates, which are 
regularly t;losed at sunset. There are two large mosques, besides several other places for 
prayer. There is a spacious market-place in the centre of the city, and another large square in 
front of the sultan's residence. The dwellings of the principal people are surrounded by high 
walls, which inclose numerous coozes, and flat-roofed houses, built in the Moorish style, whose 
large water-spouts of baked clay, proJQ^iiig from the eaves, resemble a tier of guns. The 



Kerissaries of life dre terr cBeap , butbtier*^ meat is in great plenty, and rerf good. Tlv 

itports are principally ci^et and blue check tobes. The common imports are brought fnot 

Xshaniee, and coarse calico, and woolen cloth in small quantities, nith brass and pemaf 

lisbei, and some few spices from Nyffee. The Arabs from Tripoli and Ghadamis bring m- 

brought silk, aiiar of roses, spices, and bcadi^ 

Slaves are both exponed and imponed. 

A great quantiry of Guinea corn is like*

On enteiing ihis lotritory, the British ttir- 
elers found ibemselves at once among â–  n- 
perior people. The fields were covered irirfc 
large crops of wheat, two of which were vt- 
nually produced by irrigation. The coiinir; 
exhibited numerous plantations, neatly fencM

with travelers, and in the shade of the tieei

Cowries, lead ore, cattle, &c. 

'^ 13. Timbneloo. This city, which has so long been the object of intense and unsaiisfien 
curiosity to Europeans, was first visited during the present century, by Adams, an Americia, 
Laing, ati Englishman, and Cailli^, a Frenchman. Adams was shipwrecked on the coutaad 
Carried to Timbrutoo as a slave in 1810 ; bis relation, however, is not generally receivedti 
Authentic. Lairg reached the city upon bis travels in 1836, but was murdered on his return. 
Cailli^ visited 'Hnbmtoo in 18^, returned to France and published a nairative of bis tnreb, 
^hich, though doubtful on many points, is too interesting to be disregarded. According to 
{his traveler, the city stands about 8 miles from the Joliba or Niger, and forms a sort of tnia- 
gle, measuring 3 mites in circuit. The houses are large, hut not high, consisting eniirel; of 
t ground floor. They are built of round bricks baked in the sun. The streets are clean, lod

19. hhabUanti of J^figrilia. These are either negroes or Moors, as the mixed nca ol 
Arabs are generally called. The Moors are gradually gaining bd ascendency orer the nun 
6mid blacls. They resemble the mulattoes of the West Indies more than the Hoonof 
Barbary. Park describes them as having wild and staring eyes, like a *' nation of lunxiei.'' 
The negroes, in the various tribes or nations, are more or less dark, but m general, ibcf n 
perfectly black. Though subject to few diseases, they do not attain to old age. In di&m 
parts the African phj^siogoomy is much diversified ; and the thick lips, and broad, flu aoie, 
often give place to features of the European cast. In various nations the faces, or limbs ad 
body, are tattooed, in lines made by gashes. 

20. Dnts. The dress of the Moors is somewhat like that of Barbary, and the IuHm ii 
generally the mark of a Mahometan believer. The dress of the African nations is vuioo; 
generally it is only a shirt or other garment of cotton. Many people have hut a strip of corer- 
ing about the waist, and numbers have not even that. Id Boraou turbans are worn, and ibe 
women are exceedi^ly neat in their persons and dress. The following cut represents a Sboa 
man and woman. The Feilatahs and Bornouese are the most remarkable among the negroo. 

The latter are described as ugly, sn^ 
and good-natured, but utterly destitute of 
intellectual culture ; only a few of the greit 
doctors can read the Koran ; b writer is heU 
in the highes|r estimation, but his only com- 
positions are a few words written on scnpt 
of paper, to be worn as amulets. Id tbe 
absence of all refined pleasures, various rods 
sports are pursued with eagerness, such u 
boxing and wrestling ; gaming is also a firor- 
ite sport. The Bornouese cavalry are cot- 
ered with mail and iron plate, and their 
horses are also cased in armor ; they ire 
armed with long spears, and are accompaDi- 
ed to war by bowmen and spearmen on fool ;

ttyj 18 t loose robe, or sUrt, of the cotton cloth made here, which is often fine, and beantiftdly 
dyed ; and high rank is indicated by 6 or 7 of these, worn one above another. Many of the 
people, however, have no dress but a girdle round the waist, and a piece of cloth wrapped 
round the head. A protruding belly, and a huge, misshapen head, are the two features, with-^ 
gat which, it is vain to aspire to the rank of a fine gentleman ; wadding is profusely employed 
oy the courtiers, to produce the one, and cloth is wrapped round the head, in fold after fold, 
to obtain the other ; thus padded and stuffed, a Bomouese courtier adds still further to his 
onlk, by wearing 10 or 12 robes of cotton or silk ; and the whole pf this monstrous creature 
s decked with numberless charms, enclosed in green leather cases. 

A Bomouese belle decorates her person by plaiting the hair, and attaching to it strings of 
brass or silver beads, inserting pieces of amber or coral, in the nose, ears, and lip, and be- 
smearing her face with oil. In the great market of Angornou, there is plenty of their princi- 
pal grain, called gussub, much wheat and rice, bullocks, sheep, and fowls ; but no vegetables, 
except onions ; and no fruits, of any kind, are to be seen. A similar picture of Fella tah 
civilisation might be drawn, but the traits are nearly the same, and it is unnecessary to repeat 
the description. 

21. Language. The language is the Arabic, and there are various separate African dia- 
lects. The Mandingo is the most generally diffused of the African languages, but the Arabic 
will probably settle into the general medium of communication. 

22. Manner of Building. The Moors, who do not live in tents, build their houses after 
the manner common in Barbary, and keep thAn neatly whitewashed. The architecture of the 
negroes is rude ; the houses are low and small, and made generally of mud or wicker-work 
They are mostly thatched. 

23. Food and Drink. The food of the Central Africans is simple ; bread, which so much 
supports life in most countries, that it may be called its staffy is hardly known here ; a paste, 
however, like hasty-pudding, is common, and also the kouskousou of Barbary, under the name 
of katukaue. Much grain is raised, but few esculent vegetables ; generally, only a few onions 
and tomatoes. Little fruit is raised by cultivation. Poultry is general. Salt, frond its scarce- 
ness, becomes a luxury, beyond the reach of the poor, and children may sometimes be seen 
sucking it, as sugar is eaten in other countries. To say of a man, that he eats salt with his 
food, is equivalent to calling him rich. The breakfast hour is generally about daybreak, and 
2 is the hour for dinner ; supper is taken late. Tobacco is much used, in smoking and other- 
wise. SnuflT is not taken in the nostrils, but chewed with a certain plant. The Moors and 
the negro Mahometans, drink nothine but water, though pitto^ or ale, is generally in use with 
all others. In some, towns, all the inhabitants seem addicted to intoxication. It tastes much 
like the English ale, and a bitter plant is infused, in the place of hops. 

24. Diseases. The most common diseases are fe- 
vers, fluxes, blindness, leprosy, and the guinea-worm. 

25. Traveling, The mode of traveling from one 
kingdom to another, is by kafilas or smaU caravans, 
or associations. Duties on merchandise are paid in 
the countries through which a kafila passes. 

26. Character^ Mannersy and Customs. In the Af 
rican character, timidity and gendeness are obvious 
traits ; and. this it is, which, together with their small 
states, and the commerce of Christian nations, has re- 
duced Africans to slavery in every quarter of the globe. 

The negroes are cheerful, kind, and generally pla- 
cable. Their pursuits are pastoral or agricultural, 
though they are often engaged in petty wars, in which 
Jfegroesy dmdng. ^hey show little mercy. The females are uniformly 

kind and compassionate, and almost every European 
traveler in this country, has owed his life to their assistance.* The Africans are generally

The staves in Africa are supposed, by Park, to be lo the free, as 3 to I . Tbe syuen of 
servitude is the sroiirge of. Africa, no less than tlie curse of America. There is no ssfety lor

and just. There, the creditor may like p(Â» 
nssion of his debtor's property, pay himself, and reserve commission for his trouble. If ih 
debtor refines his consent, he is pinioned and laid upon his back till he releau. When Ai 
property will not pay the debt, the insolvent pleads his poverty, and the cadi says, " God sea4 
yoQ means," to which ihe bystanders respond, *' amen," and the debtor is free. The creditor 
aaay, however, at any time, have his debtor's property, even to the second shirt, or HipeHb-

Among a simple and ignorant people, we may expect to find some customs, that may sew 
â– s ridiciiluus in itnlistred nations, as Kuropean manners in Africa. Thus, at Bnrnnu, it il t 
great recommendation, at court, lo have a protuberant belly. It is considered the tfpe <if 
abtrodance, and honored accordingly. All merit, however, has counterfeits, and ihe aipiri^ 
conrtier, whom a course of fattening diet cannot enlaige, deprived of the reality, indulges ia 
resemblance. He stufTs himself with cushions, so that the belly is out of all proportion irilk

I tk tMiaberd, and in riding it bangis oyer the pummel or the saddle. It is the raslnon, also, at 

^ Bomottf to wear seven or eight loose garments, and a turban of ?asi dimensions. At the EngÂ«

ri tttbieiis at Bomou. 

Â» Among the Arabs, it is the Female whose estimation is much increased* by bulk. To be fal 

9 among them is to be beautiful, and mothers cram their female chil Iren as geese are fattened io 

"i fiiglmid. The process, though painful, and often enforced by blows, is generally successful ; 

1 ltd a perfect beauty with the Moors is, according to Park, ^^ a load for a camel." 

? The Moors, which have so much sway in Africa, may he described as cruel, bigoted, mali- 

if cious, and treacherous ; studying mischief, according to Park, ^^ as a science," and eminently 

f Ivccessful in their studies. They live by plunder and extortion. Tliey have little cheerfulness 

ti md few amusements. The chief amusement of the negroes is dancing, which they often keep 

â€¢ tip, like their enslaved countrymen in America, during the whjie night. It is a pleasing sight 
Â«^ fo see a whole village, thus engaged by moonlight, under the trees. The iustruments most in 

â€¢ oae are the guitar with 3 strings, a harp with 18, and a smaller one with 7. There are two 
r Idnds of drums, one of which is large, and used to spread an alarm. Some of the dnnces are 
> peculiar. In Bomou, the female dancers suddenly turn their backs to each othef, and thus 

meet with much violence, endeavoring to destroy each other's equilibrium. 'J'he successful 
I. one is much cheered. Just before the expected concussion, one dancer will sometimes step 
\ nimbly aside, and leave her opponent to seat herself with considerable force upon the ground. 
^ Soonetimes, also, the smaller parly, that wotild suffer in the shock, suddenly drops down, 

leaving cite larger to tumble over her. The negroes engage much in wrestling, at which they are 
i very expert, and would probably carry off the honors of any ring in Europe. 'J^hey approach 

each other on all fours. Boxing is common ; the blows are given with the right band, and 

warded off with the palm of the left. It is a favorite trick with the boxer to get his antagoÂ«i 
V aist's head under his arm, and to bruise it in that situation. 

37. Kdneatinny &c. The education in Central Africa includes but the reading of the Ko 
, ran in Arabic, and this degree of knowledge is rare. The religion is the Mahometan, whick 

is rapidly spreading, and Fetishism, which includes a belief in cbam.s, conjurations, and divi* 
f. nation. The governments are many of them of a patriarchal kind, but undergo many chans^es ; 

and deposed Sultans are said, by Denham, to be as common as bankrupts in Europe. The 

. iooiy is the magistrate of towns, and the place of assembling is the bentang^ a stage, or someÂ« 

^ times a tree. The palavers are judicial meetings. In Â«ome places there are trials by ordeal. 

28. Industry^ &c. The inhaoitants are much more civilized and industrious than the neÂ« 

. gfoes of the coast, and they have formed large states with regular governments. Goldsmiths, 

weavers, tanneis, blacksmiths, and other skilful artisans are found among them. Many of them 
, bliBt elephants and illinoceroses for their teeth and horns, gather gums, collect gold, kidnap in- 
^ dividuals of neighboring tribes, whom, with their other articles of merchandise, they barter for 

arms, silks, ornaments, salt, &c., with the caravans from Egypt, Barbary, Nubia, and the sea 

coast. 

CHAPTER LXXVIIL WESTERN AFRICA. 

1. Bow%darie$y ESztenlyand Dtoiriont. This territory is bounded north by the desert of 
Zahara and Nigritia, east by Nigritia and unknown territories, and southwest and west by the 
Atlantic. Its limits are undefined, but it may be described in general terms, as extending 
ifom about 16^ N. latitude, southward nearly to the tropic of Capricorn. The most genera! 
divisions under which the country is known, are those of Senegambia^ Guinea^ Congo^ Angola^ 
and Henguela ; these include many subdivisions and independent districts. 

2. SenegamMa. This territory is the most northern of the districts of Western Africa. 
It is bounded north by the Desert, east by Nigritia, south by Upper Guinea, and west by tlie 
Atlantic. It is for the most part flat and sandy. Magnificent forests of tall trees are scattered 
ever the face of the coimtry. The palm, the cocoa, the tamarind, banana, fig, date, and the 
butter tree are all indigenous. Oranges, lemons, and limes also abound. Reptiles are numer- 
ous. The climate is exceedingly hot ; the east winds, which reach this country after sweep* 
il^ over the burning surface of Central Africa, are almost insupportable. During the whole 
fear, ihe heat of the sun at noon is intense ; the thermometer is sometimes at 131^ at Sene^dL 
wnm Juan tc Octelier, beavy rmns faO. This region is wtmered by the Senegal river, whick 



508 WESTERN AFRICA. 

rises in the mountains of Kong, and flows northwesterly into the Atlantic, after a coune of 
about 1000 miles ; and by the Gambia aqd Rio Grande, which have the same origia aoddi* 
rection, but are inferior streams. On the coas^ is Cape Verde, the most westerly point of Af- 
rica. This region is divided into a great number of small states. The English, Freocb, wA 
Portuguese have some settlements and factories upon the coast ; the greater part of the com- 
try is now in the possession of three nations, who have conquered nearly all of the other 
tribes ; these ruling people are the Jalofs or Yalofs, the Mandingoes, and the Foulabs,orFel* 
latahs. Many of the Negro tribes of Senegambia are Mahometans, but there is also a greit 
number who worship /e/tc^s, that is, certain natural objects selected as objects of veoentioD, 
and there are some idolaters. The Mandif^oee are the most industrious and most civilized of 
the Senegambia negroes ; they carry on an extensive trade with the Europeans and Americaai 
on the coast, in gold, ivory, and slaves ; their women weave cotton and stuffs, which they dye 
with indigo ; and the men are good hunters, and cultivate the earth with some skill. Tbejr 
dwell in villages, and their houses are circular mud huts, with a conical roof of bamboo, thatched 
with leaves. The Mandingo b the commercial language of all this region. The FoMam 
the same race as the Fellatahs of the interior ; they are, like most negroes, gay, gentle, kiod, 
and hospitable ; they raise indigo, maize, rice, &c., weave stuffs of wool and cotton, or punoe 
the chase ; some of them are wandering shepherds. 

The Jalof states occupy the northwestern part of Senegambia ; they are governed by he- 
reditary princes ; Wallo, Caior, and Jalof Proper, are the principal states. The Jalofs are of 
a pure black color, with regular features, and they excel the Mandingoes in the manuiactun 
and dyeing of cotton ; they are fearless hunters, skilful horsemen, and brave warriors. 

The Mandingo states lie to the south of the preceding ; they are Kaarta, Bambouk, Sdomj 
Kaboo, &c., comprising the Soosoos, Biafaras, &c. ; the people of Bambarra, in Nigritia,are 
also Mandingoes. 

The Foulah or Fellatah states are a sort of theocracies, being governed by elective spiritd 
princes, styled almamys, or chiefs of the faithful. The principal are Fovda Taro, Bondoo^ 
Fouta Jallo, of which the capital, Teemboo, has about 9,000 inhabitants, Cksso, and JPovWoo. 

The FSrench colony of Senegal, upon that river, consists merely of several factories or 
trading posts ; St. Louis, the principal town, has 6,000 inhabitants ; and Goree, upon the 
island of^ that name, 3,000, mostly slaves or free blacks. The English factories are upon the 
Gambia ; Bathurst, is the principal station. The Portuguese have some slave-ti^diog posts 
among the Bissagos islands, of which Qacheu is the chief station. The principal articles of 
trade carried on by the two former settlements are spirituous liquors and tobacco, in return for 
which, they receive gums, bees' wax, gold dust, and ivory. 

3. Guinea. The country is bounded north by Senegambia and Nigritia, east by uaknown 
countries, south and west by Cimbebas and the Atlantic. It forms a crescent arouod the 
Gulf of Guinea, and is intersected by the equator. It is separated from Nigritia and Sene- 
gambia by the mountains of Kong. The great river â€¢NHger, or Quorra, enters this countiy 
from Nigritia, and flows into the Atlantic by several mouths, which intersect a tract of countij 
240 miles in width along the coast. The principal of these mouths are known by the names of 
the rivers, ^un, Benin, Formosa, Old and JVctÂ« Calabar. The other rivers are the Zotre, Â« 
Congo, which flows into the Atlantic by so wide a mouth, and with so deep and rapid a cur- 
rent, that it was at one time imagined to be the outlet of the Niger. Its origin is not knowo. 
The Coanza, which also rises in unknown regions, flows northwesterly into the Atlantic. 

This country is commonly regarded under two general divisions. Upper and Lotoer GiitÂ«w. 
These have a great number of subdivisions. Upper Guinea consists of the Grain Coasts Ubenii 
the hory Coast, Gold Coast, Slave Coast, or fVhidah, Benin, Calabar, Biafra, Gaba, Â«nd 
Calbangos, which are all upon the coast, and Kooranko, Kong, Dagomba, KtlUnga, iSsreM, 
Buntakoo, nAshantee, Dahomey, and Eyeos, in the interior. Lower Guinea comprises CongO) 
Angola, Benguela, Ergoyo, Catongo^ Loango, Mayemba, Sette, and Anxiko. 

The English colony of Sierra Â£eont was founded in 1778, with the benevolent purpose of 
suppressing the slave trade, and introducing civilization into this dark comer of the earth. But 
the soil in the neighborhood is exceedingly sterile and unproductive, and the colonf 
has made but slow progress. Freetown is the chief place ; it contains about 4,000 inbabitints, 
several schools, &c. In 1828 a settlement was made on Fernando Po, a fertile and beeUv 
bland in the gulf of Guinea, but this island is claimed by the Spaniards, who refuse to cedi 
it to the English. The Grain or Pepper Coast is considerably fire^ieoted fi>r Guinea pepper, <

only production. The hory Const has no good harbors, but is visited in boats for its trade in 
ivory. Upon the Gold Coast are some Dutch settlements, of which El Mina is the capital ; 
it has a population of 15,000. The chief British settlement in this quarter is Cape Coast 
QuiUj which contains 8,000 inhabitants. The Slave Coords a lowr swampy country, covered 
with a luxuriant and perpetual vegetation ; it is governed by a viceroy under the king of Da- 
hoQiey. The slave-trade upon this coast has of late been greatly checked. 

The American colony of Liberia was founded by the American Colonization Society, in 
1821, for the purpose of facilitating the gradual emancipation of slaves in the United States. 
Th^ spot selected for the first settlement was a litde elevated peninsula, lying between the 
mouth of the river Mesurado or Montserrado and the sea, and terminating in a cape of the 
same name. After suffering much from the hostility of the natives, with whom it liad to sus- 
tain several severe conflicts, this little colony has at length obtained tranquillity, and is in an 
exceedingly prosperous condition. The territory over which its jurisdiction now extends, 
lies between Cape Mount and Cape Palmas, or between 4^ and 7' N. latitude ; comprising 
the tract above mentioned under the name of the Grain Coast ; it occupies about 225 miles 
of coast, with a breadth of from 20 to SO miles inland. The climate is found to be healthful, 
although emigrants are liable to be attacked by the country fever on their first arrival. Its 
fertile soil yields rice, cotton, coffee, sugar, indigo, banana, cassada, yams, &c. Camwood 
is abundant, and the timber is durable and well fitted for building. The natives are the Deys^ 
an indolent and inoffensive people, occupying the coast on both sides of the Mesurado to the 
number of 1,000 or 3,000 ; the Bassos^ also a peaceful but more industrious and numerous 
people further south ; and the Qu^aks and Condoes in the bterior. There are also scattered 
settlements of Kroomen^ whose native country is near Cape Palmas, and who are a laborious 
and hardy race, acting as pilots, porters, and oarsmen for the trading vessels on the coast ; 
they commonly speak English. The settlement on Cape Mesurado, which received the name 
o( Monrovia is now a flourishing town, with about 2,000 inhabitants. Caldwell^ JSTew Georgia^ 
and Millsburgj higher up the river, also present proofs of the independent and comfortable 
situation of the colonists. " From New Georgia to Millsburg,'' says an eyewitness in 1839, 
^'a distance of 17 miles, the right bank of the river exhibits an almost continuous line of culti- 
vated farms, many of them of considerable size. Millsburg stands on the St. Paul's, a large 
tributary of the Mesurado, and consists of a single street, about a mile and a half long, running 
parallel with the river. The town is pleasantly situated and exhibits a highly picturesque 
appearance. Edina^ about 60 miles from Monrovia, on the river St. John's ; Bassa Cove^ 
which, after having been desolated by some hostile natives, has since been reoccupied, and the 
Maryland colony of Harper^ a neat and thriving little village at Cape Palmas, are the other 
principal settlements. The colonists consist of free blacks, emancipated slaves, and recap- 
tured Africans, taken from the slavers, to the number of about 4,000, beside whom about 
1,500 of the natives have put themselves under the protection of the colony. Already neat 
frame or stone buildings have been erected for houses and warehouses, school houses have 
been provided and supplied with teachers, churches have been built, and a press set up, from 
which is issued a respectable newspaper. The native traders from the interior have visited 
the colony, and an active commerce is carried on partly in colonial shipping, and partly by 
American and European vessels. Palm oil, ivory, dye-wood, hides, wax, and pepper, are 
among the articles of export, in addition to the productions before enumerated. 

Beniuy or Adou. This State, of which our knowledge is very slight, embraces a great 
part of the vast delta of the Niger. The capital of the same name is a large, though not 
populous town, with about 15,000 inhabitants. JBonny, in one of the tributary States, is an 
important commercial town with 20,000 inhabitants. The manners and customs of the inhab- 
itants appear to resemble those of the people of Ashantee and Dahomey. ^ 

The most important of the interior districts is the kingdom of Ashantee. It is about 800 
miles in length, and 350 in breadth. The soil is fertile, and the country completely covered 
with vegetation. Sugar-cane, rice, the butter tree, pawpaws, ananas, and bananas are cuiti* 
vated. The population is above 1,000,000, without reckoning the tributary nations, which 
tre 22 in number. The inhabitants weave and dye cotton with considerable dexterity, and 
hold a trade with the coast in gold dust and vegetable butter. The immense forests of the 
country afford abundance of palm oil. 

The metropolis, called Coumassij is large and regularly built ; it is insulated by a marsh, 
which contains many springs, that supply the town with water ; and it is also encompassed by 



410 WSSTEBN AFBCiU 

M 6m forest. The figure is oblongs and ibe circamfereDce betvreen inreeand foor inilti; tin 
principal streets iire very long and wide. The walls of the houses are formed of sukes md 
wattle* work, filled up and coated with clay. They have gable-ends, and thick poie^i soppon 
a frame of bamboo, over which interwoven palm-leaves are placed fonhatcb. In geueni, 
they have only one floor, and, where they have two, the lower part is divided by a irdt, to 
support the rafters for the upper room^ which are usually covered with a frame^ivork ihicU| 
j9tuccoed with ochre. The doors consist of an entire piece of wood, cut with great labor oei 
of the stems or buttresses of the cotton tree ; and the windows are open wood-work, caned 
in fanciful figures and intricate patterns, and painted red. ^^ The palace (says Mr. Bowdiichj 
js an immense building, of a variety of oblong courts and regular squares, ilie fonnervith 
arcades along one sicie, some of round arches symmetrically turned, liaving a skeleion o( 
bamboo ; the entablatures exuberantly adorned with bold fan and trellis work of Kgypdn 
character. They have a suite of rooms over them, with small windows of wooden lauice, of 
intricate but regular carved work ; and some have frames cased with thin gold. The squam 
have a large apartment on each side, open in front, with two supporting pillars ;" and this kiid 
of proscfninm is a mark of distinction ; for none but military officers, beside tlie kinj, 
iu*e pern>itted to build in this nKXle. Chairs and stools embossed with gold, and beds of sUk, 
ire among the articles of royal furniture. The population of the capital is about 15^000. 

The Ashantees appear to be the most powerful, commercial, and warlike of all the tnlies 
of Western Africa ; yet, until the beginning of the present century they were not known, eves 
by name, to the Europeans. Since that period they have been visited by travelers from tbe 
coast. They have recently carried on hostilities against the British with remarkable success, 
and in 1823, they defeated, and totally destroyed a British army under Sir Charles BIcCanli]r, 
Jibe governor of the colony at Cape Coast Castle. 

The kingdom of Dahomey lies to the east of Ashantee, and is bounded south by the giX 
of Guinea. The soil is fertile, producing maize, millet, grain, potatoes, plantains, oranges,. 
citrons, and other tropical fruits, with indigo, cotton, sugar, tobacco, and spices. The wind 
called harmattan^ blows in this country for three months in the year ; rains and hurricanes are 
periodical. The inhabitants have some skill in manufactures. They make good cloth, tod 
dye it of various colors. Their smith work is quite respectable ; they use a bellows foriDed 
of two goat skins, with a musket*barrel for a pipe ; a stone is used for an anvil, and a* rouid 
iron bar> a foot in length, for a hammer. ,Wiih these tools they manufacture spears, cutlasses, 
and other weapons, carpenters' tools, bracelets, rings, &c. Cowries are used for niODej, asd 
ibe king maintains a considerable standing army. 

Loango was formerly a dependency upon that of Congo. The people are industrious, ni 
not only occupy themselves in various arts, but engage also in commercial pursuits. The 
climate is remarkably warm, and along, dry season regularly follows a long conuoiiatice of 
rain. The cocoa and banana thrive beside the more common fruit-trees ; and the couon plant 
and sugar-cane are cultivated with success. 

Congo is bounded on the north by Loango, on the south by Angola, and on the east by the 
territory of the Giagas. The climate is extremely hot in summer ; but the winters arc Â» 
mild as the finest springs of Italy. The wild animals are elephants, lions, leopards, paoiliers, 
wolves, zebras, buflaloes, &c. The country is likewise infested with a variety of serpents, 
some of which are of a monstrous length and thickness ; with rattlesnakes, vipers, scorpioos, 
and venomous insects of various kinds, both flying and reptile. Among the msects the most 
wonderful are the temiites^ or white ants, which construct works in the most ingenious rcao- 
Der and apparently in a scientific form, and compose an orderly and well-regulated roiunw- 
nity. Their earthen structures are sometimes raised to the height of seven or ei^ht feet, and 
appear like the huts of the natives. These little creatures not only destroy the fniits of the 
earth, but in the night surround beasts, and sometimes men, in prodigious swarms, and devotf 
ihem in a few hours, leaving only the bones. This country was discovered, in 1487, by the 
J'orUiguese, who formed settlements on the coast, and endeavored, but not with efiectire s^ 
0e.ss, to convert the natives to Christianity. ^^ 

To the southward of Congo is the kingdom of ^ngoh^ which used to supply the FreseJ 
and other dealers in slaves with multitudes of those wretched and degraded beings, and siiO 
furnishes the Spaniards and Portuguese with a considerable number, as those nations cootinii 
the abominable traffic, in defiance of the general voice of Europe. In Loanda, which i>w^ 
chief town, the Portuguese have a settlement, which is the gre^t mart of slaves. 



Fvttlrar to tbe south is (be territory of Bengvela^ with which the Portuguese are eko 
connected. The climate of this country is particularly insalubrious, and the people are rude 
and barbarous. Mines of copper exist among the mountains ; but they are not rendered, evea 
hy the European colonies, subservient to general use. Tbe other territories are insigni6cant. 
The Portuguese have numerous factories and posts upon some parts of the coast, and claim 
extensive territories in CongO| AngoU, and Bengueldi ; but in many cases their claims are 
merely nominal. 

4. Inhabitanla. There is considerable diversity in features and color, in the difTerent 
nations or tribes. The peculiar negro features are not found in all. The Mandineoes have 
regular and open countenances, and among the Ashantees may be found faces oi Grecian 
shape and precision. The negroes are generally well shaped ; and among the females may 
often be seen the most gi^ceful forms. In all things but in color, they have what are allowed 
in Europe to be the reqtiisites for beauty. The dress is various, and different tribes and 
people of the same tribe nidulge in a diversity. In some places, nakedness is hardly covered, 
and in others the dress is cumbrous. In Timannee, it is considered respectable to wear large 
trowsers, of several spans of cloth ; and great breeches there are synonymous with great men. 
A ruler in that country on seeing Laing take ofThis gloves, exclaimed in astonishment, ^^ AUa 
akhar, lie lias pulled criflT the skin from his hands ! '' 

6. Language. The languages are various, but the Arabic is gaining ground as the Mahonv 
ftan religion spreads. 

6. Mmner of Building. The manner of building is slight, as the dwellings are intended to 
be t defence fiom heat, and not froni cold. In Asliantee, the houses are built with some skiU 
and regularity, and tbe rooms are rudely painted, in regular and pleasing 6giire8. 

7. Food and Ihink. The general food is light, consisting chiefly of rice, honey, yamd, 
groundnuts, and fruits. Palm wine, and pUto^ the country ale, are tlie chief intoxicating liquors, 
though, on the coast, may be had the European spirits. On the coast, there is much beastlf 
intoxication. 

8. Mannert and Oustotm. The slave-trade has been fruitful in evil to this part of Africa, 
and all over the continent it has perpetuated mischief, no less than in America. It lias broken 
up the foundations of society, and much depraved the character of the negroes. In the inCe* 
rior, where the European traveler has never penetrated, may yet be found tribes, living in the 
simplicity of innocence, but depravity may be measured by the approach to the coast. On 
tbe coast, however, the African cliaracter remains, and the people are timid and cheerful. 
They are placable, and will, in a moment after a quarrel, be perfictly reconciled. Some of 
them are warlike, and all of them, under many circumstances of war, kidnapping, &c., 
are cruel. 

In Dahomey, the people are characterized as having a strange mixture of ferocity and poÂ« 
Gteoess ; and in Ashantee, they live, with many of the comforts of civilization, in a state of 
Aocking barbarism. They have trade, wealth, and a regular government ; but the human 
sacrifices, perpetrated in the capital, are almost beyond belief. The king, and grandees, 
have vessels of silver and gold, and the English mission remarked a great natural politeness 
among the courtiers. Suicide is not uncommon, in cases of disgrace. The people are ex- 
tremely neat in their persons, dress, and houses ; and they bathe daily. Cowardice is punish* 
ed as a crime, with death ; and in wars, the general places himself in the rear, to kill those who 
may retreat. In some of the negro nations, there is an institution called the ttmo, or the ptifN- 
ruh. The chief, and the initiated, reside in woods ; and by the power of superstition, as well 
as of force, render the neighboring people tributary. Some classes are generally privileged, 
and may travel safely when the countries are at war ; these are orators, or lawyers, minstrels, 
bkcksniiths, and shoemaktfs. The palavers are jtidicial and deliberative assemblies, and <^to 
bring a pahver,^' is, in omer words, to bring an action. On these occasions, the orators are 
very adroit. In some parts, constructive damages are albwed to a great extent. Thus, when 
aggs were stolen, after the lapse of years, the loss was computed on the supposition, that they 
would have hatched and multiplied in the greatest ratio. There is a general deference to old 
Ige, and there are no destitute old people to be seen. 

The common amusements are dancing, story-telling, and singing. The dancing is^ often 
continued by the whole village, during the night. The only education ever received, is that 
^agtee of knowledge obtained by a few, to read tbe Koran, and write a few sentences in A rahio. 
The Mahometan religion has some followers in almost every tribe, and a reader in the Kofan 
enjoys considerable reputation. Generally, tliere is some notion of a Supreme BvÂ«ing. 



fil2 WESTEBN AFRICA. 

There are msny fetiches^ or indefinable objects, principles of worship, or consecrated thmp 
The fetiche seeras to resemble the obi of the West Indies, and the taboo of the South Sei 
Islands. Charms, amulets, and saphies, or written charms, are in great use, as defence froo 
danger, &c. It is a general custom, in eating and drinking, to throw a litde food or drink od 
the ground, as an offering to the dead. At various places, but especially in Ashantee aodDi- 
homey, there are human sacrifices, and Coomassie is the very court of Moloch. At the " yam 
custom," in September, when the yam is ripe, the convicts are executed ; but all chiefs, who 
enter the city, have the right of sacrificing 4 slaves, one at each of the 4 comers of the city. 
At the death of a chief, or one of his family, the grave is filled with the heads of the victims 
who are sacrificed, that their spirits may be in Attendance on the soul of the departed. Wben 
the king's mother died, 3,000 people were slain ; and, on occasions when the king would pro- 
pitiate the higher or the lower powers, he offers these sacrifices ; and, as the victims are taken 
promiscuously, the streets are deserted, or a few people only cross them by stealth, or nn 
through them at full speed. When a death takes place m a family, the slaves run forthwith to 
the woods, for it is usual to sacrifice one on the instant, and more at the burial. The persons 
to be sacrificed, are sometimes led in processions, with a knife through their cheeb and 
tongue. 

In the Portuguese settlements, which are large, and divided into duchies, counties, and mzt- 
quisates, the Christian religion has been preached to the negroes since the 15th century. The 
gospel, however, is not embraced by any free nation, and the Jagga negroes have associatioos 
to prevent its spread. This cannot excite surprise, when we consider what Christians bare 
done in this part of Africa. 

In Congo, Loango, and other countries, more or less subject to the Portuguese, the labors 
of the Capuchin missionaries have been successful, and there are more than 100,000 converts, 
including some native princes. It is probable, that their Christianity is not of the purest kind. 
The outward forms of worship are those of the Romish church, though there are many pagan 
observances. French ecclesiastics, also, founded missions in Cacongo and Loango, in 1766. 
The missions are still kept up, though feebly, in these countries, and in Benguela. At Sierra 
Leone, bibles are distributed by thousands in the native languages, and negroes of superior tal- 
ents trained for teachers and missionaries. Similar advantages are spread, also, from Liberia. 

The king of Ashantee has 3,333 wives, and the number is religiously kept entire, tbough 
many of them are infants, and but a few hundred of the wives are attached to the palace. Po- 
lygamy is common on the whole coast, but the Mahometan professors have generally but 4 wives. 
When the wives of the king of Ashantee go out, they are preceded by boys with whips, wbo 
fall upon every one in the street, that no one may see the ladies. These boys or pages, bare 
the right of pilfering in the market, and they are always busy in their vocation. They will 
trip down a countryman, bringing his supplies, and wben scattered on the ground, collect the 
merchandise and run away. The market people, however, are very circumspect, and if tbev 
can take the pages before they reach the palace, may inflict upon them any beating short of 
death. 

The government of the difi^erent countries or tribes, is despotic, aristocratic, or republican. 
The ordeal by poison i^ used in many places, and the poison must be 'taken both by the ac- 
cused and the informer. Few of either survive it. Lander, who was forced, on his return, 
to swallow a bowl of the vegetable poison, walked off unharmed to his tent, where he dis- 
charged hfs stomach by a powerful emetic, and received little injury. 

At Ashantee, the legal interest is 33 J per cent for 40 days, and if the debtor cannot paj, 
he may be sold to slavery, subject to redemption. In charges of treason, if the accused is 
acquitted, the accuser suffers death. It is forbidden, by law, to praise another man's wife; 
so that " honey-mouth," as flattery is called, is not in repute. Cfhjugal disputes are some- 
times settled by the interference of Mumbo Jumbo^ a mysterious personage, who seems to be 
in the interest of the husband ; his interposition is decisive. â™¦ He is an incarnate bugbear, 
dressed in the barks of trees, and sometimes surmised to be the husband himself. Jfutnbo 
Jumbo comes at evening, and goes to the Bentang tree, where the whole' village assembles, 
though the females are the least pleased, for no one knows to whom the visit is intended. At 
about midnight, Mumbo Axes upon the oflTender, who is stripped, tied to a tree, and scourged. 

The peol)le of the western countries have the art of smelting iron, though they dofiotnse 
the metal skilfully in any manufactures. They have some sweet and simple tunes, whicb tbey 
play on a calabash guitar, with a few notes. Marriages, among the Mandingoes, are celebiitca

by sbouttng, drinking, and firing guna, and the bride is cvried to her husband's house on thÂ« 
shoulders oF an old woman, who walks all the way upon mats spread before her. There are, 
in the African concerts, also, pipes, boms, drums, and old brass pans. 

CHAPTER LXXIX. SOUTHERN AFRICA. 

i . BouHdariet and Ettent. Under this head, we include all the country exteodtsg from 
the last described territories, southerly to the Cape of Good Hope, comprising the Cape Col- 
ony, OafiVaria, and all the Hoiteniot and Cimbebas regions. It will lhu3 extend from the Cape 
of Good Hope, or rather Cape Agulhas, the southern extremity of Africa, in latitude 34Â° 5&' 
South, to about 16Â° S. latitude, oU the Western Coast, and 36Â°^S. latitude on the Eastern 
Coast. Its boundaries are Guinea, unknown countries, and Monomotapa, on the north, the 
Indian Ocean on the east, the Southern Ocean on the south, and the Ailaniic on the west. 

2. Cape Colony. This district occupies tbe southern extremity of Africa. The leading 
(eaiure in the aspect of tbe Cape territory, consists in 3 successive ranges of mountains, ruo- 
ning parallel to each other, and to the southern coast of Africa. The first range, which, at 
least m a great part of its line, is called the Lange Kloof, or Long Pass, runs parallel to die 
coast, at a distance of from 20 to 60 miles, widening towards the west. The second range, 
called Zwarle Berg, or Black Mountain, is considerably higher and more rugged, than the first, 
and consists, often, of double or even triple ranges. The belt, interposed between the Zwarle 
Bei^ and the Lange Kloof, is nearly of the same average breadth, as that between the latter 
and the sea, and it is of considerably greater elevation. Beyond the Zwarte Berg, at an inter- 
val of 80 or 100 miles, rises the J^ieweeldl's Gebirge, or Snowy J^ountains, the highest range 
of Southern Africa, and the summits of which are generally covered with snow. They have 
not been accurately measured, but are not supposed, in their greatest height, to fall short of 
10,000 feet. The passes, between these mountains, are called Kloofs, in Dutch. The fol- 
lowing cut represents a pass, called Hottentot Hollands Kloof. The bell, or plain, interpoaed 
between these two last chains, is considerably more elevated then either of the two others, so 
thai Southern Africa forms, as it were, a succession of terraces, rising above each other; 
Tfati plain next the sea, is covered with a deep and fertile soil, watered by numerous nvulots, 
well clotted with grass, and with a beauuful variety of trees and shrubs. Rains are frequeot ; 
and from its vicinity to the sea, it enjoys a more mild and equable temperature, tbao the inte- 
rior aod remoter parts of tbe colony.

spersed with large tracts of tbe irii 
desert, called karroo. The third belt, 
called the Great Karroo, is compoNd 
of a vast plain, SOO miles in leoph, 
and nearly 100 in breadth ; ibe soil 
of which is of a bard and impenein- 
ble texture, destitute, almost, of ererT 
trace of vegetation. The plains of 
South Africa, called karrooi, prestm

plants, sparingly scattered over the surface, crackle under the feet, and seem, from the fiiol 
and feeble traces of vegetable life, to maintain a perpetual struggle for existence. 

The northern front of Tdile Mountain overlooks Cape Town, and rises almost perpendicu- 
larly, hke the ruins of some gigantic fortress, till it terminates in a line, nearly horizontal, nd 
of about 2 miles in extent, the highest point of which is about 3,585 feet above Table Ba;. 
The west side of this stupendous mass of rock, extending along the seashore, is rent into h^ 
lows, and worn away into pyramidal masses. The ascent of the mountain is very steep ind 
difficult, on account of the loose stones, which roll away under the feet of the traveler. Itt 
summit is nearly level, and very barren and bare of soil ; several cavities, however, are fiDed 
with water, or contain a smalt quantity of vegetable earth, from whence a few odoriferoin 
planta, particularly the ^aaa mvcronata, an elegant frutescent plant peculiar to this rejioa, 
draw their nourishment. Antelopes, baboons, solitary vultures, and toads are sometimes to 
be met with on the mountain. The view from the summit is very extensive and picturesqiX'

winter, and in the shade, is geaenllf 
about 15^ lower than that of the iowd; 
but in summer the ditference is still greil* 
er, particularly when the southeast wind 
blows, and a fleecy cloud, called "iIr

and gives indication of an approechijig

OUfant or BUphantU Rivtr. These streams are only oavieable- by small craft to tbe disitaM

unite their waters nearly 600 miles due east from their mo 

latitude 23^ SO*. Most of these rivers, swelled by periodical rains, deposite much mud and 

sand Bt their mouths ; some of ibem in the dry season are lost amid the sands and rocks. 

Besides these principal rivers there are a number of small streams, which may be generally 

crossed dry-shod, but after a fall of rain increase to a great size. 

4. ClimaU. The seasons in this colony are divided into monsoons, of which there are 
two annually ; tbr one wet, the other dry. The dry monsoon is called summer ; the wet 
monsoon constitutes winter. The former, .or rather the spring season, commences id Sep- 
tember, the latter in March. During the diy monsoon, southeast winds are prevalent. The 
wet monsoon is generally attended with northwest winds. The weather, dunng the wet mon- 
soon, is disi^reeable and moist, but the cold is never severe. Ice is never much more than 
the eighth part of an inch thick. Thunder and lightning are rare, and seldom violent. Ths 
atmosphere is healthy, and agrees well with European constitutions. 

5. Sail, Productiona, &c. Of the district occupied by the colony, a great part is moun 
tsioous and barren ; but it contains many fine and fertile tracts. 1 he Cape has long been 
celebrated among naturalists and botanists as a fertile field for their labors. Almost every 
animal found on the African continent, may be found in the neighbourhood of this colony. 
Two varieties of the lion are found in Soutb Africa, namely, ibe yellow and the brown, or, as 
the Dutch colonists often term the latter, the blue or black lion, wbiot 

peat ravages among the cattle. The dark colored species is ths strongi

ranked. The colonists are making rapid advances in several new experiments, the most 
prominent of which is the introduction of the silk-worm. The mulberry tree grows spoota^ 
aeously, particularly on the southeast coast ; and the produce promises to be of the utmost 
advantege to the trade of the Cape. Wool is also becoming an important article of produce. 
The Cape supplies various articles of provision and refreshment to ships sailing between Eu- 
rope and the East Indies. Among these articles may be enumerated com, flour, biscuit, 
beef, brandy, and wine ; and while tb^ remain in Table Bay, mutton, greens, and fruits ;

Ae^ other products for exportatknu The iolaod trade carried on with the nitfhres has Bol.Â«lf 
tBtteh inoreased in value of late years, but has essentiallj altered its character. The medina 
erf traffic was formerly trinkets and useless articles, but the natiires now demand clothes, blai* 
kets, tools, and utensils, and the trade has become regular, and is rapidly growing in amoint. 

Cbpe- Totem, the capital, is situated in a valley, at the foot of Table mountain, aod mike 
southeast angle of Table bay. It was founded, in 1652, and is built with great regulv itj, aoi 
with a considerable degree of elegance. The streets, which are wide, intersect each other 
at right angles. The houses, about 1,500 in number, for the most part are of stone, cemeotei 
with a glutinous kind of earth, and are generally whitewashed x>n the outside. Their height ii 
seldom more than two floors, frequent storms rendering a greater elevation dangerous. Haoj 
of the houses have trees planted before them, which give a rural appearance to the towm 
The castle is a large pentagonal fortress, on the southeastern or inland side of the town, close 
to the water's edge. The colonial office possesses a fine collection of books. To the soatb- 
ward of the town a great number of elegant villas are scattered about, and the scenery resem- 
bles that of the rich and cultivated districts of England. Labor, house-rent, and fire-wood, 
constitute a large proportion of the expenses of living at Cape- Town ; fruit, vegetables, aad 
sea-fish are abundant and cheap. Horse-races, balls, masquerades, and Sunday promenades 
in the government gardens, form the leading amusements. Population, 20,000. 

The colony is divided into 10 districts. The population amounts to 160,000 souls, of whoa 
86,000 were slaves,principally Hottentots. They were emancipated in 1834. The annual faioe 
of the imports is 5,000,000 dollars ; of exports 1,600,000. The Cape of Good Hope wai 
discovered by Diaz, a Portuguese navigator, in 1493, who called it Cabo Tormeotoso, or 
Cape of Storms, from his having experienced stormy weather there. Emanuel, king of Foh 
tugaK inspired with the hope of now reaching India by sea, gave it the more cheering BÂ»Be 
of Cape of Good Hope, which it has ever since borne, and which it has communicated to the 
surrounding region. The Dutch first formed a settlement on the coast in the middle of the 
next century, but in 1806, the colony was conquered by Great Britain, and has since remaioed 
in her possession. In 1834 and 1835, the colonists became involved in a severe conflict with 
the neighboring Caffires, and the result of the war was the extension of the limits of the cot 
ony from the Keiskamma, the former boundary, to the Great Key River, by which a large 
tract of fine country has been added to the colonial possessions. 

7. Caffraria. This country lies along the coast of the Indian Ocean, and comprebeodi 
various tribes on the Koussas, Tambookies, Hambounas, Betchuanas, Mashows, &c. 

^^ The Caffre nations," says Malte Brun, <^ inhabit a region less known than any on the 
globe. We there see, behind a marshy, unhealthy, but fertile coast, chains of mountains arise 
that have been very imperfectly examined, which appear to be in a parallel dh'ection with the 
coast, that is, from southwest to northeast. Our missionaries inform us, that those parts of 
Caffraria which they have visited, are mountainous and rich in water. The soil is argilh* 
ceous, tempered with fine sand, and very fertile. The whole surface, and even the tops 
of the mountains, are covered with woods, shrubs, and grass ; never naked and parched, ex- 
cept in uncommonly dry seasons." 

The winter, which is the rainy season at the Cape, is in Caflfreland the driest ; and moet 
of the rain comes down by thunder-storms in the summer. The country, in general, b con- 
siderably elevated above the level of the sea, and much colder than, fit>m its nearness to the 
tropic, might be expected. Perhaps the plentiful rains, the high mountains, and the stioBg 
electricity prevailing in the atmosphere, may be mentioned among the causes of its fertilitj. 
The thunder-storms, which are more frequent and tremendous than in Europe, exhibit abo 
uncommon phenomena. The flashes of lightning, which in Europe difl^use a light througl)|ffae 
air, which dazzle the eye, and disappear in a moment, here consist of a stream of distinet 
sparks drawn by the earth from the clouds, or from one cloud by another. 

The most common animals in Caflraria are the ox and the wolf. Of the former (includiif 
bulls and cows), the natives often possess several hundreds ; and some keep above a thousawl. 
Of the latter, there are two kinds ; the first spotted ; and, on that account, called by^ic cob- 
nists. Tiger-wolf; the other is the Strand-wolf. The first is most common, and very troaUa- 
some. The lion and the buflilo are less frequent. These animals seem to be fond of eadi 
other, and commonly keep company ; though the lion uses the buflfalo for food Â£lks ffOf 
very large ; one of them aflfords nibre meat than two oxen ; they are easily taken. The ele- 
phant of this country is very tall, mnch more so than that of India ; his teeth are somedoies

broiuht from the colony ; but there are two botis of wild horses, the Dovw and the Quoggw ; 

the former is more beautifully streaked ihau the latter. The quagga is an ooeniy to the wolf,

horse. I looked upon this description as somewhat fabulous, till we cai 

among the Boschmen ; there one of bur company saw an animal among _ 

be had never seen before ; he said, that it was like a most beautiful horse, but much lai^er. 
Ihe Boschmen pointed to a plain where they said these animals were found in great numbers. 
This one had a tail like that of a n'gau, but with a much longer bunch of hairs at the point." 
This appears to be the unicorn of Campbell and others. At Mashow, a town in the territory 
of the Tamahas, an animal of the rhinoceros kind was killed in 1621, having a horn projecting 
three feet from the forehead, arising about ten inches above the tip of the nose. A few inches 
of a small second horn, behind, did not afiact its unicorn appearance. The bead measured 
three feet from the mouth to the ear. It is at present deposited in the British Musuem. 
There are two sorts of wild hogs. The rhinoceros with two horns, and the sea-cow, are also 
BMives of this country. T!ie latter has strength and courage enough to throw a rhinoceros 
from the rocks, down into the river. The rhinoceros, however, is the terror of the elephant, 
and sometimes puts many of them to flight. There is a variety of antelopes, distinguished by 
the names of Steinbok, Springboky ^c. 

About 900 miles to the northeast of Cape- Town, is ^ew Latlakoo, situated near the source 
of the Krooroan, a main branch of the Orange river ; and 50 miles beyond that, stands Old 
Latlakoo ; each of these towns contains about 4,000 inhabitants. 

Campbell, in 1821, penetrated as far as Kurreeckant, the capital of the Marooizea, and was 
fivorably received. The population of this town was estimated, by him, at 16,000 souls. 
Mr. Campbell saw many founderies in Kurreechane ; hut he regrets, that they were guarded 
with so much jealousy, that he was not allowed lo enter them. Kurreechane appears to be the 
Staffordshire, as well as the Birmingham, of that part of South Africa. They manufacture 
pottery ; and, in the shape and painting of their articles, show a superior degree of lasts. 
They appear to excel in the making of baskets ; and Mr. Campbell found the walls of iheir 
bouses ornamented with pahitings of elephants, camelopards, shields, &c. 

6. MiabitanU. The white inhabitants are Dutch, Germans, English, and a few French. 
There is, also, a considerable number of the mixed race, and there are a few thousand Malays 
at the Cape. The negroes are Q^eflr of the Hottentot, or Caffre race. The color of the 
Hotlentott is a yellow-brown, and their formation is peculiar. They have verj' small hands 
md feet ; their faces are broad above, and narrowed to a point. Their cheek bones are prom- 
raeot, and their lips thick. In some tribes, the wool grows in little tufts, like the teeth of a 
shoe-brush, and when suffered to grow, hanÂ« in fringes. The Bwhmen are a uibe of Hot- 
lentois, anciently separated from the rest. To European eyes, the women are objects of hor- 
ror ; lean and gaunt, except over the hips, where all the flesh seems to be piled. A Venus, 
drawn from the Hottentot model, would have little resemblance to that of Florence. The 
Hottentots smear themselves with fat and soot, and are so used to it, that, when washed, one 
seems to he without his clothes. The Caffres are of a black-gray color, and, like the Hotten- 
tots, have a few tufts of beard on the chin. They are exceedingly well-formed, hardy, and 
active. They travel much, if for no other reason than to visit each other. The females are 
small, but finely formed. The Betckuamu are, in form, superior even to the other Caffres. 

The native tribes dress chiefly in the skins of sheep, which the Hottentots wear, with the 
wooi, generally, in the form of a cloak, open before. This is called a carom. The females 
Inve a petticoat of skins, or leather. The Caffres dress in leather, which they have the art to 
render very pliant. They wear many ornaments of beads, rings, carved bones, &c. The 
MIowing is a representation Of the Queen of Lattakoo, in full dress. The Bushmen, when 
tbey have any clothing, dress like the HotientoU. Their handkerchiefs are jackal's tails, 
tied to a handle ; and, with these, they wipe the perspiration from their faces. Tbe English 
(aagusge is, now, that of all c^cial proceedii^s ; but the Dutch is the general language in the

for the want of a better pipe, they smoke through the afaitik 
bone of a sheep. They smoke, also, the leaves of i Iciod 
of hemp, calleddocAa, wbichatupifiesaodioioxicates. Tk

of their subsiatooce is drawn from their herds. Much bni- 
Qhmm ^ Imi^im. dy is consumed, which is ^read over the ct^ony by bmm 

of traveling pedlers. The wioes of the Cape are, mm 
tt tbetn, excellent. The Frontignac, and Lavelle, are equal to those of FrancÂ«. The Ccs- 
â€¢lantia is produced from tbe vine of Sbiraz, in Penia. Some of it is exquisite. The wioe^

The mode of Uaveliog is laborious, and slow ; in tbe greater part of the colooy, there nt 
BO roads, and the colonists travel in wagons, draws by 6 or 7 pair of oxen, with relays Id U' 
teodaace. They carry, also, sheep for prarit- 
ions, for there are no ions. This can, uoiler >â€¢ 
circumstances, be called rapid traveling, except 
by comparisoo. Campbell, who was Eusiliv 
with it, eoasoted himself with the redeclJos, 
that the pace of an ox was swift, compared wA 
tbatofasnailor cbamelion. Tbe ox )s also fre- 
quently used with a saddle ; aod a receat trtT-

Cape-Town, a " Hotlentot chief, riding >l TuH

society, at Cape-Town, has not been highly praised ; but all travelers admit, that tbe lidiet are 
distinguished for sweetness and alTability. The Hottentots, who have been called a stupid nee,

They are filthy in their persons, and indolent in their habits, but tbey make good servants lo

CHAPTERLXXX. EASTERN AFRICA. 

1. Boundaries, Extent, and Divirioni. Under this head, we shaU comprise all the Afncn 
coast, from tbe straits of Babelmandel to Cafiraria. This territory is bounded north by Abyi* 
sinia and the straits of Babelmandel, east by the Indian Ocean and tbe Mocambique channel, 
south by CaSraria, and west by unknown regions. It extends from 13Â° NiM^b, to 36Â° South, 
latitude* and may be regarded under 6 divisions ; Monomotapa, Mozambique, Zanguebv, 
-Ajan, and Adel. 

3. Jtfonotnolapa. This district is the most southerly, and includes Sofala, Inbambaoe, and 
Delsgoa. It is watered by several rivers, the lai^est of which is tbe Zambeze, aaid by tbt 
natives to rise from a great lake. The river Delagoa falls into a lai^e bay and is navicablt 
SOO miles for large boats. The soil is fertile, producing rice, maize, sugar-cane, and fruit. 
Gold abounds in the interior, and Sofala is thought to be tbe C^hir of the soriptuies. The 
inhabitants cony on a trade in ivory, gold dust, and gums. The slave-trade was formerir 
carried on here largely by the Portuguese, and has not yet entirely ceased. The country m 
Inhabited by various uibes, and the right by discovery to tbe whole territory is churned hj 
tbe pOTtuguese. 

3. Motambiqut. This district lies to the north of Monomotapa, and is traversed by ibo 
Lopata mountains, but its interior, as may be said of all the territory described in this chapter) 
is very little known. Tbe city of Mozambique is tbe emporium of Eastern Africa, and wat 
rich and flourishing long before the appearance of Europeans in these parts. It has a good 
harbor, and is still visited by European ships, but tbe immense slave-trade upon which it d^ 

Snded for its support has declined, and it now affords hardly any articles of commerce, 
ere are some manufactures of rope from the fibres of the palm tree. There is also a little 
trade in gold dust. The shoals in ihe neighborbood of the city afittrd a vast vorie^ of beau- 
tiful shells. Tbe inhabitants are Moors. The population is about 6,000. 

4. Zangiubar. The coast to the north of Cape Delgado is vaguely termed the Zaoguebai 
coast. It is well watered, fertile, and well timbered, and contains some excellent ports. Our 
knowledge of it is extremely imperfect. The principal states seem to be Qutloa, â€¢WomioM, 
Melinda, and Magadoxo, so called by Europeans from their respective capitals, wUch are 
petty towns. The whole of this coast belongs to the imam of Mascat. 

5. ^jan and Mel. The coast from Zanguebar to Cape Guardafui bears the name of .tf/wi ; 
it is dry, rocky, and barren. Tbe want of harbors, the sterility of the country, and the fierce- 
ness of the natives have prevented it from being much frequented by traders. North of thb 
frwn the Cape to Abyssinia is ^del, which is iubabiled by tbe Somaulis, who also occupy tbe 
cout of Ajan, and probably extensive regions of the interior. They are not negroes, bol 
bave long hair, and an olive or blackish complexion ; and are probably either of tbe Coffre oc 
Bteber roca. They have slupi of Ibeir own, and are active, enterprising merchoati. Tbiii 



KBVSBBXUL 

ekief towoa are Befbera aod ZtUa^ which cany on a trade with the natives of the unbioiii 
regiODs of the inteiicHr, and with the Arabs of the opposite shore. 

6* Jfnhabitants. Of the people on the coast, northeastward from the Gape of Oood Hope, 
little is known. The inconsiderable European commerce that is held with them is carried ob 
by the Portuguese. In Botongo the king is called grand iorcenr and grand robber^ lod 
be is constantly attended by 400 executioners. A better custom exists in four ministen 
who yearly traverse the kingdom, one representing in eastern allegory the person of th 
monarch, a second his eyes, a third his mouth, and a fourth his ears. The Mahometao 
religion and the Arabic language are common on the coast. The people of Monomotapa ire 
as little known to Europeans as they were in the 16th century. They go nearly naked, and 
ire credulous in charms and conjurations. The king, as in Ashantee, is said to have a ginri 
of armed females. In Zanguebar the sovereign assumes the title of ^^ Son of the Supreioe 
Lord," and goes to war with 300,000 troops mounted on oxen. The people are^aid to li?â‚¬ 
without a settled religion, or law. Each one has some different object of worship. There 
are few fruits or vegetables, and millet forms the principal article of food. There are nuiaben 
of the Moorish inhabitants. In Magadoxo, the king and principal people only are dressed ; 
the common people go nearly naked. The king, except on journeys, has neither conrtnor 
guards, and no one salutes him. The ashes of the kings and queens are collectcfd in urns of 
goM. Criminals are despatched with a club or exposed to wild beasts. The inhabitants rear 

Sreat numbers of cattle, and trade in slaves, gold, silver, ivory, oil, frankincense, pepper, 
rugs, wax, ostrich feathers, &c. 

CHAPTER LXXXI. ABYSSINIA. 

. 1 . Boundaries and Extent. This country is bounded north by Nubia, northeast by the Red 
Sea, south by Adel and unknown districts ; and west by Nigritia. It extends' from 8^ to 1(P 
N. latitude, and from 34^ to 43^ E. longitude, and contains 340,000 square miles. 

2. Mountains. Abyssinia is very mountainous ; and is sometimes described as a table- 
land with a gentle inclination to the northwest. A lofty range called the Lamabnony exteoib 
along the shore of the Red Sea. The mountains of Samen in Tigre are still higher. In the 
south and west are several ridges, supposed to be branches ofthe mountairis of the Mood. 
These mountains do not rise to the height of perpetual snow. Their sides are steep aod tbej 
generally shoot up in sharp peaks. One of the most remarkable characteristics of its surface 
M the ambas or hill-forts, isolated hills rising suddenly with steep and almost inaccessible sides 
out ofthe plains, and often displaying on the top a level surface of considerable extent. 

3. Rivers. The Bakr el Jizrek^ or Blue River ^ rises in the country of the Adows, 'flows 
through the Lake Dembea^ into Sennaar, where it joins the Nile. This is the streiim whose 
â€¢ource was discovered by Bruce and considered by him as the main branch of the Nile. The 
Tmecazze is another stream falling into the Nile. 

4. Climate. The level shores of the Red Sea have a very hot air, but in the greater part 
of the country the numerous mountains produce a temperature seldom uncomfortably warn. 
Thunder is frequent and violent, and the sort of whirlwind known in the Indian Seas by the 
name of typhoon, is common. The rainy season lasts from April to September,' doring 
which time the country is drowned by a continual deluge. 

5. Minerals. This country seems quite destitute of metals, but it contains a great plain of 
adt, four days' journey in extent. For about half a mile the salt is soft, but afterwards be- 
comes hard like snow partially thawed. It is perfectly pure and hard for two feet in dq>th. 
The inhabitants cut it in pieces, which serve not only for food, but circulate as money. 

6. Jinimals. Hyenas are very numerous in this country, and render traveling highly dan- 
gerous. They even enter houses and often assemble in vast troops. Elephants and rfaiooce- 
â€¢roses are common in the low grounds. Buffaloes and antelopes are common, and the zebia 
18 found in the south. The woods swarm with crocodiles and hippopotami. The horses are 
â€¢trong and beautiful, and the domestic oxen have enormous horns. 

7. Divisions. This country consists of several separate independent States. Tigre oni^ 
Red Sea, JImhara in the west, and the districts of Shoa^ Efaty &c., in the south. Three 
centuries ago these countries were under a single government. The population is supposed 
to be about 4,000,000. The powerful Slate of Tigre comprises aa area. ^ 300)000 sqotfB 



ASYnDflA. tS& 

â€¢ 

t, wMi 8 pofndatioD of 3,000,000 inbabttants. The people are warlike and iodtistnotia. 
t, the capital, has about 8,000 inbabitants. Mowa^ the principal commercial town) 
about the same number of inbabitaDts. â€¢damm, once the capital of a powerful empire, now 
contains a population #f 3,000 souls, and there are many ruins, and remarkable edifices, in the 
town and its vicinity. In the great square alone, there are 40 obelisks, some of which are 
remarkable for their dimensions. 

On the western side of the Taccazze, is a colony of Jews, called FaltUhas^ or exiles, whose 
ancestors fled to this country, from the victorious arms of Nebuchadnezzar ; they preserved 
their uidependence until 1800, when they fell under the dominion of Tigre. 

The Kingdom of Gondar comprises the central part of Abyssinia. Gondaty the chief 
town, has from 30,000 to 40,000 inhabitants. The Kingdom of Jlnkober comprises the rich 
eat and most fertile provinces of Abyssinia ; but, Uke Gondar, is now governed by the Gallas. 
Xbe Kingdom of Amhara is also now in the hands of the Gallas. ' 

8. JigricuUurt. The common article of agriculture is a grain, called tefft which grows in 
almost every soil, and is made into a bread, used in every part of the country, and from which 
a sort of beer, called houza^ is prepared. Wheat is raised upon the mountains. The papy- 
ras, which furnished the paper of the ancients, is produced here. The soil, along the banks 
of the rivers, is uncommonly fertile. 

9. Commtrcty ManufactureSy &c. Cotton cloths are manufactured in large quantities, the 
fine sort at Gondar, and the coarse at Adowa. The manufactures of iron and brass are con- 
siderable ; the metals are procured from Sennaar, Wolcay t, and Berbera. Some leather and 
parchment is also made. The exports are gold, ivory, honey, slaves, and rhinoceros' bones. 
The foreign commerce is transacted chiefly at Masuah, a port on the Red Sea. This town 
acknowledges the sovereignty of the Grand Signor. 

10. Inhabitants. The Abyssinians are in general well made, and, though nearly black, they 
have neither the nose, lips, nor hair of the negroes. They are considered to be of Asiatic 
origin, and to be nearly related to the Arabs ; and the Amharic and Gheez languages, which 
are spoken in Ankob^r, Amhara, Tigre, and other States, bear a considerable resemblance to 
the Arabic. They are superior to most African nations, and their manufactures of carpets, 
parchments, iron, and brass ware, leather, &c., show a good deal of skill. They have, also, 
authors, and even piunters. The Abyssinians are Christians of the Greek church ; the priests 
are not well informed ; nor are the people, in general, well bstructed in toe principles of the 
Christian religion ; but the sacraments of baptism, and the Lord's supper, are administered in 
a decorous manner, and the ceremonies are conducted with much decency. Polygamy is com* 
monly practised, and the secular clergy are allowed to marry once. The Jews, who form a 
considerable class, settled here in remote ages, and have nearly lost the Hebrew language. 
They are considered as sorcerers, and it is believed, that they can transform, themselves into 
hysnas. They are generally smiths, weavers, and carpenters. 

The Abyssinians dwell in round hovels, with conical roofs, to conduct ofi* the heavy rains. - 
The children go naked, till the age of 15. The common dress is a loose one, of cotton cloth. 
The various grains supply a chief article of food, and the savage gayety of a feast is heightened 
by draughts of hydromel, tinctured with opium. At the feasts, beef is eaten in its raw state, 
swimmmg in blood. The soldiers, in a march, cut slices from the thighs of the cattle, cover- 
ing the place over with skin, and drive them on. It does not seem to be certain, that, at the 
common feasts, it is usual to cut the steaks in this manner, from the living animal, though it is 
recently killed. The great lords are fed by servants. 

The manners and customs are those of a barbarous people. Their religion is mixed with 
Jewish practices. Circumcision is practised, and the Jewish and Christian sabbaths are ob- 
served. Saints, angels, and especially the Virgin Mary, are objects of worship, and there is 
a belief in transubstantiatiop, pomts derived from the Portuguese. The Abyssinian bible con- 
tains an additional book, called the book of Enoch. The priests are permitted to marry. It 
will be perceived, that the religion is Christian, rather nominally, than practically. There are 
several negro tribes in Abyssinia, who have preserved their independence. Although speak- 
ing distinct languages, they are all called ShangallaSy by the Abyssinians. Some of them live 
part of the year in caves, and the remainder under the trees, feeding upon locusts, serpents, 
ko. They are hunted like wild beasts by the Abyssinians, and there are many ShangalHi 
slaves in Tigre and Gondar. 

The ChiUa$ are a brown raceÂ« noted for their ferocity and deep barbarity. Some of tbtm 

66 



htve, ID a great measure, adapted Al^ssinian numners ; but manj of the tribes are ^ 

shepherds aod warriors : they are of small stature, but have long hair ; maoj of tbem bsva 
embraced Mahometaoism, and they have become the ruling people in several of the AliyasiDiM 
Suites. They seem to hive emigrated firom Central Africa. 

U . History. Abyssinia was little known to the ancients, and the tradition which makes As 
Queen of Sheba an Abyssinian princess, and the monarchs of the country descendants of Sol- 
Stton^ seems to be a mere fable. In the 4th century, the nation was converted to Cbriatkoity ; 
in the 1 5th century, it was visited by the Portuguese, whose attempts to convert the A^yssi- 
nians to the Roman Catholic faith, led to furious civil wars, and since that period, Uttle inter* 
course has been maintained with Europe. Abyssinia was governed by native princes, imtfl ffae 
inroads of the ferocious Gallas, who have made themselves masters of neariy the whole ceon- 
|ry, and even they generally seat one of the native princes on the throne, to whom they leave 
the form and shadow of sovereignty* 

CHAPTER LXXXIL NUBIA. 

1 â€¢ Boundaries and Extent. Nubia is bounded north by Egypt, east by the Red Sea, souih 
by Abvsainia, and west by Darfoor and Cordofan. It extends from 129 to 24^ N. fartitude, 
comprising an area of about 375,000 square miles. 

2. Mountains^ Rivtn, &c. From the borders of Egypt, the land rises gradually to ifaa 
south, through this whole country. In the south and east, are some high mountain riches. 
The land is everywhere intersected by large and small valleys. The Bohr el â€¢Szrekj from the 
east, and the Bohr el Miad or finite Atver, from the west, here unite to form the Atle, 
which, with its numerous head branches, traverse the country from south to north. In the 
upper part of its course, this river flows between high rocks, which confine it to its bed durioe 
the period of its highest inundation, and here it forms several rapids and cataracts* Part ol 
the country is a desert, covered with deep, loose sand, and sharp, flinty stones. In some 
places the soil is sprinkled with rock salt. The water, during the rainy season, is black and 
putrid. The climate is intensely hot, but healthy. A great part of this extensive region is 
BOW subject to Egypt, but the submission of some ef the tribes is merely aominal. 

3. Towns and Divisions. Sennaar^ lately the capital of an independent and powerful State, 
has .about 10,000 inhabitants. It is now merely a mass of mud huts and cabins, but there are 
ruins which show it to have been formerly a considerable town. The kingdom of SennaoTy 
which extended over a great part of southern Nubia, was conquered by the Egyptians in 1822. 

Shendy^ a small and meanly built town with about 7,000 inhabitants, is the commercial em- 
porium of Nubia and the greatest slave-mart in the country. In the neighborhood are the 
ruins of Meroe^ anciently the seat of learning and science, and which some suppose to have 
been the cradle of Egyptian arts and letters. Below Shendy is the country of the Shtygyas^ 
a nation of warriors and freebooters, containing no considerable town. 

Dongola^ capital of a small State, which previous to the Egyptian expedition had been con- 
quered by the Mamelukes, was formerly the richest and largest city of Nubia, but is now 
reduced to a few hundred inhabitants. The northern part of Nubia, or Lower Nubia, called 
also the land of the Barabras, contains Derry with about 3,000 inhabitants, chiefly of Turkish 
origin, and Eibsamboulj a petty village, remarkable for the magnificent cave-temples in lU 
neighborhood, enriched with historical sculptures and paintings, colossal statues, and columns. 
Numerovis ruins line the banks of the Nile throughout this region. Tlie country between the 
Red Sea and the Nile valley consists of vast deserts and rugged and sterile hills, occupied 
by numerous wild and wandering tribes. Suakim^ on the Red Sea, is an important commer- 
cial place, and a great slave-mart ; population 8,000, chiefly Arabians. 

4. â€¢Agriculture.' Dourra and bammia are the principal grains cultivated ; cotton and tobacco 
are raised in some parts. The Nile does not rise sufficiently high to overflow its banks, and 
the land is irrigated by means of water-wbeels, as in the following cut ; the machinery is turned 
by cows. The inhabitants make palm wine, beer, and distil a spirit from dates. Sooie 
cotton ck)th is manufactured. The chief articles of export are dates and slaves. The popu- 
lauon IS about 250,000. 

5. Inhabitants. The inhabitants of Nubia are composed of various races. Tbe Nubiam 
proper, inhabiting the valley of the Nile, consist of two branches, the Kenoos and the Nubahs* 



NUHA. S8S 

They speak difiereot dialects of tbg 
same language, and are called by the 
Arabs Berbers or Barabras. They 
have long been subject to roreignera, 
and are poor and ignorant. In the 
villages, round huts of mud or loose 
slones, and in towns, houses around 
ao open court, in the Egyptian Tasb- 
ion, are ifaeir habitations. A few 
earthen jars and dishes, a hand- 
mill, a hatchet, and some slicks to 
form a rude loom, constitute the 
whole furniture. A blue shirt or a 
woolen cloak and white cap are the 
attire of the men ; the women are 
wrapped up in linen rags or woolen 
gowi;s, with earrings and bracelets 
of glass or straw. The weapotn 
ere a club, a lance, and a shieU 
Water^BkaU. (FagtfSa.) covered with hippopotamus skin. 

The Nubians are well made, muscular, strong, and handsome, with thick but not woolly hair, 
â– id little beard. The women are often handsome, and have generally a sweet expression and 
engaging manners ; they are favorably distinguished fiom the Egyptians by their superior 
morality. The complexion of the Nubians is quite dark, but they have not the negro physi- 
ognomy. Coarse woolen mantles and mats, drink ing-cups, and dishes woven irom palm 
leaves, are their only manufactures. Most of the Nubians are Mahometans ; but in the soudi 
are some heathens ; the Arabs, who are the ruling people in many of the Slates, are also 
Mahometans. The ruling people in Sennaar are ihe Sbillooks, a black race from Nigritia, 
#ho conquered the country in the ICtb century. The wandering tribes of the eastern deserts 
ire Biiharians, Mabdes, &c. They are often at war with each other, and are faithless and 
treacherous to strangers. 

The chief anicle of food is a coarse cake made ofdourra. Much tobacco is raised. Palm 
wine is used, and also a liquor called btnua, resembling beer, and made of dourra or barley. 
Burckhardt describes the Nubians as a well-formed race, though lean, and the women, though 
not handsome, are the most virtuous of all the females of the East. The inbabiiants with 
whom Burckhardt traveled were oot addicted to plundering or pilfering. That part of Nubia 
wbtch borders on the Nile, is strewed with antiquities, generally subterranean, or excavated 
from rocks. One of the most interesting is the temple ai Ebtambal ; it is cut from a perpen- 
dicular cliff'. At Ihe entrance are six erect colossal Ggures, measuring, from the ground to the 
knee, six feet. Near the temple are four other statues nearly buried in sand. The one which 
ii the most exposed, measures seven yards across the shoulders. 

The people of Sennaar are nearly negroes. Some are idolaters, others Mahometans, but 
ibey eat pork freely. Sennaar is included in the recent conquests of the Fasha of Egypt. 
The Shiilooks, a race of negroes, in 1504 invaded the country and rendered the inhabitants 
tributary. 

6. Hittory. Nubia was known to the ancients under the name of Ethiopia, and appears to 
have been at a very early period, the seat of a powerful empire and a civlhzed people. 
Egypt was repeatedly conquered from this quarier, and, indeed, according to some, she derived 
her arts and wisdom from Ethiopia. Neither the Persians nor the Romans, the Saracens nor 
the Turks who reduced Egypt, were able lo subdue this country, wbitji early received and 
long retained the Christian religion, but by some unknown agency has in modem times become 
Mahometan. But split up into numerous petty Stales, and torn by the dissensions of rival 
chieftains, Nubia has sunk into a low state of barbarism, and the tale conquest by Mehemet Alt 
may he the first step of its regeneration. 



EGYPT. 
CHAPTEtt LXXXIII. EGYPT. 



ArddUetart of AnatM EgypL 



. Boundaria. Egypt is bounded north by the Mediterranean Sea ; east by Arabia, tixi 
Red Sea ; south by Nubia ; and west by the Great Desert. It extends from latitude 33Â° 
to 32'^ N., and from longitude 24Â° to 35Â° Â£., being about 600 miles la length from norih to 



â€¢outb, and about 400 in breadib ; and having an area of 186,000 square miles, and a popidi- 
6oa of 3,600,000 inhabitants. 



Fitw Ml tU JiUt. 



"EGYPT. 'Af^ 

S. RiMn. The only riTer ii tbe Mfc, which is fornied in Nubia by ibe junction of two 
great itreBDis, the SaKr el ^tnk, which rises in Abyssinia, and tbe Bahr el Jltiad, which is 
supposed to have its sources in tbe Mountains of the Moon, to tbe southwest. Trareraing 
^SJP* ("")> south to north, the Nile, below Cairo, divides into several branches, which dis* 
cbai^e its waters into the Mediterranean. Tbe two principal mouths are that of Roiella on 
the west, and that of Damittta on tbe east. Its length ia about 2,400 miles. It annually 
overflows, and fertilizes the country upon its banics during the summer months. 

3. Surface and Oatet. The northern or lower part of Egypt consists of a rich alluvial 
plain. Egypt to the south of Cairo, is a long valley, through which the Nile flows, shut in by 
nountains, beyond which, on both aides, are vast sandy deserts. In some parts of these 

deserts, at the distance of 100 miles 
or more to tbe west of the Nile, are 
amall fertile spots of cultivated land, 
situated like islands in the midst of 
an ocean of sand ; they are called 
oautf the name by which they were 
known to tbe ancient Greeks, and by 
the Arabs Elaak or Wady. The 
Great Oasis west of Thebes, is 100 
miles in length from north to south, 
and 15 or 35 in breadth. That of 
Siwah is about 6 miles long, and 4 
wide. A large proportion of this 
space is Glled with date-trees, which 
aSbrd the chief food of the inhabit- 
ants. The dates are gathered in the 
manner represented in the subjoined 
cut. There are also cultivated pome- 
granates, figs, olives, apricots, and 
plantains, and the gardens are remark- 
ably flourishing. A considerable 
quantity of rice is cuhivated here. 
This has been supposed to be tbe 
oasis where tbe famous temple of 
jjgjij,-;-, natt. Jupiter Ammon formerly stood. Mr. 

^'^â„¢* Browne found here the ruins of an ed- 

ifice which appeared to be the work of the ancient Egyptians, as the figures of Isis and Anubit 
were conspicuous among the sculptures. Here are also catacombs, or ancient places of 
sepulture. 

The motiniatns, which border the Nile, in Lower Egypt, are of a calcareous nature ; but 
this composition ceases about 60 miles to the northward of the cataracts, and is succeeded by 
freestone, in beds ; and, near Syene, granite and syenite, which takes its name thence, are 
the chief component parts. In the eastern chain, abrupt precipices frequently appear, resem- 
bling long walls, and apprnacbing tbe banks of the river. 

4. Laluf. In Lower E^ypt are several lakes, the largest of which is the lake of MttizaUk^ 
vhich is separated from the Mediterranean only by an extremely narrow ridge of land, and 
communicates with that sea, by 1 or 2 ouileis. It is 50 miles long, and from 2 to 13 broad. 
The lake of Bourloi, which adjoins, in like manner, to the Mediterranean, between Damielta 
and Rosetta, is 25 miles long, and about S broad. The ancient lake of MareoUt, is now 
â– Imost dry, although the sea has been admitted into it. Tbe JVbtron Lakei, in the desert, 
produce natron, or soda, a substitute for barilla. 

5. Jlftnero^. Egypt appears not to be productive of any metals, except a small quantity of 
"^0 ; but tbe mountains contain various kinds of marble, as porphyry, the celebrated verde on* 
tico, or green marble, with white and dark spots, and many valuable gems, as the emerald, to- 
Pn, chalcedony, onyx, &c. 

6. Climate. Rain rarely falls in Egypt, and only in light showers, for s few minutes ; thun- 
der and lightning are equally unfrequent. During 8 monibs in the year, from March to Novem- 
ber the heat is almost insupportable to a European. The other months are comparatively 
fmperatfl. Tbe southerly winds, which sometimes blow in Egypt, are, by the natives, called 



EGYPT. 

kk&mmmiy dnt is, Ae hoi winds ofihe dM$erL Tbej a#e of sach ntreme beat and arMky,' thu 
no animated body, exposed to tbem, can withstand tkeir peniicioos influence. Darilig Ae 3 
days of the southern blast, the streets are deserted ; and woe to the traveler, wboiD this wind 
surprises, remote from shelter ; when it exceeds 3 dajs, it is insupportable. Very freqdenllf, 
the mhabitants are almost blinded with drifts of sand ; but these evUs are, in a great measore, 
remedied, by the rising and overflowing of the Nile. 

7. Canah. Egypt contains a great number of canals, many of which are only adapted far 
nurposes of irrigation. The principal canals of navigation, are JostpVn Canal, about 100 miles 
m length, and from 50 to 300 feet broad ; the Canal of Cleopatra, recently restored, under die 
name of the Makmoud Canal, connecting the Nile with the Mediterranean, at Alexandria, 48 
miles long, but so unskilfully constructed, as to be already choked with mud ; and the AbuMt- 
neggy Canal, passing from the Nile to the sea, on the northeast, about 100 miles in length. 

8. Towns. Cairo, or Kahira, in a sandy plain, on the banks of the Nile, is a large toiOL, 
of the most irregular construction. The streets are so narrow, that the balconies of the oppo- 
site houses often touch each other, and many ^f them are roofed quite over. A part of tbe 
town is annually inundated. The houses are, in general, built of mud and bricks, of 2 or 3 
stories high, and, being without windows on the street side, they present a gloomy appearance. 
Those of the public dignitaries, have a basement of stone, each layer of which is painted red, 
or green, and each story is provided with a balcony. In the basement story, is a large hal, 
where the master gives audience, and also another hall, paved with marble, and supplied with sofas 
ttnd jets d^eau, A great number of mosques, many of which are elegantly decorated with an- 
besques, and light and rich minarets ; 1,200 coflTee-houses ; 31 bathing-houses, remarkable for 
their size or ornaments ; tbe vast cisterns, or reservoirs, containing a supply of water, for tbe 
people, many of which are adorned with marble colonnades, and bronze balustrades, and hare 
schools attached to them, &c., deserve notice. Cairo is the centre of an extensive traffic be- 
tween Asia and Africa, and contains about 300,000 inhabitants. The viceroy resides, gener^ 
ally, at Shoubra, a little village in the vicinity, where he has built a splendid palace, with fine 
gardens. 

A little higher up the river, are the ruins of the ancient Memphis, once the capital of Â£gypÂ£, 
and the centre of Egyptian wealth, commerce, and art. 

Mexandria stands upon the Mediterranean, and has a double harbor. Its site is a narrov 
neck of land, between lake Mareotis and the sea. It communicates with the western arm c^ 
the Nile, by a canal. This city was founded by Alexander the Great, and soon rose to wealth 
and greatness. It was the capital of the Ptolemies, and, for science and literature, was second 
only to Rome. It contained, at one time, 600,000 inhabitants. After its capture, by the Sa- 
racens, it began to decline, and the discovery of the passage to India, by the Cape of Good 
Hope, destroyed its commercial importance. At present, it consists of narrow, crooked, and 
dirty streets, and is surrounded by a high stone wall. It has considerable commerce, and its 
markets are well supplied. Population, 25,000. The remains of ancient art, in Alexandria, 
are not of Egyptian, but of Grecian or Roman origin, and, in comparison with the pyramids, 
are quite modern. What is called Pompey's Pillar, is a Corinthian column of porphyry, about 
120 feet high, of uncertain origin ; Cleopatra's Needle, is an obelisk of granite, about 64 feet 
in length, and covered with hieroglyphics. 

Rosetta stands on a branch of the Nile, 4 miles from its mouth. It is completely environed 
in groves of orange, sycamore, date, banana, and other trees. The city has a considerable 
trade, and upwards of 50 caravanserais. Population, 10,000. Damietta is situated between 
the eastern branch of the Nile and the lake of Menzaleh, 10 miles from the sea. The hous^ 
are all white, and are built in a crescent, around a bend of the river. The appearance of the 
town is beautifully picturesque, and the country in the neighborhood is the most fertile and 
best cultivated in Egypt. Here are vast magazines of rice, belonging to the government. 
The commerce of the place is very active. Population, 25,000. Suez, on the shore of the 
isthmus of that name, on the Red Sea, has a large trade with Arabia, by caravans and vessels. 
It is surrounded by a sandy desert. Population, 5,000. 

Ascending the Nile, from Cairo, we come to Medinet el Fayoum, the ancient â€¢Srsinoe, with 
12,000 inhabitants, and connected with the river by a canal. Siout, remarkable for its sepul- 
chral grottoes, is a considerable town, with 20,000 inhabitants, from which the caravans of 
Nubia and Nigritia start. Esne, with 4,000 inhabitants, is the rendezvous of Sennaer and Dar 
fur caravans. Jlssonen^ the ancient Syene, is the last town in Egypt, as you ascend tbe Nit

^juxoTj jEme, SyeiUj Ekphantinej PhiUz^ Ghizeh^ and many others, are remarkable for their 
iitiquities. 

9. â€¢%rictt&iire. Whoever is in the least acauainted with geography, knows, that the vast 
srtility of Egypt is not produced by rain (little ialling in that country) but by the annual over* 
lowing of the Nile. It begins to rise when the sun is vertical in Â£thiopia, and when the an* 
lual rains fall there, from the latter end of Mtg to September, and sometimes October. At 
he height of its flood, in the Lower Egypt, nothing is to be seen in the plains,-but the tops of 
Drests and fruit-trees, the towns and villages being, for that reason, built upon eminences, either 
atural or artificial. When the river is at its proper height, the inhabitants celebrate a kind of 
jubilee, with great festivity. The banks, or mounds, which confine it, are cut by tbe Turkish 
lasba, attended by his grandees ; and, after this ceremony, the water is led into what they call 
be khalij, or grand canal, which runs through Cairo, whence it is distributed into cuts, for sup* 
ilying the fields and gardens. The irrigation is effected by machinery. This being done, and 
he waters beginning to retire, such is the fertility of the soil, that the labor of the husbandmao 
3 next to nothing. He throws his wheat and barley into the ground in October and May. He 
uros his cattle out to graze in November ; and, in about 6 weeks, nothing can be more charm- 
Dg, than tbe prospect which the face of the country presents, in rising corn, vegetables, and 
erdure of every sort. Oranges and lemons perfume the air ; dates, grapes, and figs, cheer 
he eye ; and palm-trees, which aflford the means of making wine, are blooming and abundant. 
Che culture of pulse, melons, sugar-cane^, and other plants, which require moisture, is sup* 
died by small, but regular cuts, from cisterns and reservoirs. March and April are the har- 
dest months, and they produce 3 crops ; one of lettuces and cucumbers (the latter being tbe 
ordinary food of the inhabitants), one of com, and one of melons. The Egyptian pasturage is 
Kjqally prolific, most of the quadrupeds producing 2 at a time, and the sheep 4 lambs in a year. 
^oiODg tbe vegetable products of Egypt should also be mentioned the papyrus, of which the 
incients made their paper, though their mode of preparing it is now unknown ; and the lotus, 
i kind of water-lily, abounding in the Nile. The pith of the papyrus is said to be a nourishing 
bod. The trees are the sycamore, acacia, willow, &c. 

The Egyptian mode of hatching chickens in ovens b very curious, and has been practised 
n Europe with success. Npt less extraordinary and ingenious is the manner of raising and 
naoaging bees in that country. When the verdure and flowers fail in one part of Egypt, the 
proprietors of bees put their hives on board of large boats, each marking his own hive. The 
batman proceeds with them gently up the river, and stops with them wherever he perceives 
lowery meadows. The bees swarm from their cells at break of day, and collect honey, 
returning several times loaded with what they have obtained, and in the evening reenter their 
tiives, without ever mistaking their abode. Cotton is raised in great abundance in Egypt. It 
is sown in April, and the land is irrigated by the Nile. The neighborhood of the river is 
preferred for its cultivation. Tbe plough is generally used. The cotton is of two distinct 
kinds, the common Egyptian cotton, and the maho ; both, however, are native. 

10. Commerce. The exportation of cotton promises to constitute in futtire an important 
item in the commerce of Egypt. Until 1822, the cotton raised here was of an inferior quality. 
Since then a better sort has been introduced little inferior to the Sea Island. Tbe crop is 
now 20,000,000 lbs. Caravans perform the trade with Abyssinia, Darfur, Sennaar, Barbary, 
and Syria. There is also a trade with the ports on the Red Sea. 

11. Manufactures. The present sovereign of Egypt has made strenuous exertions for the 
promotion of manufactures. Cotton and woolen cloths are made in Esneh, Boulak, and other 
places. Linen is manufactured at Siout. There are ako some manufactures of silk, salt- 
petre, and earthen ware. 

12. PopukUion^ Mtlitary Force^ Revenue^ &c. The population is about 2,500,000. The 
military force is 75,000 men, disciplined and armed in the European mode, beside the irregu- 
lar forces of the country. The troops are chiefly Arabs and Syrians. The navy was nearly 
annihilated at tbe battle of Navarino, but still consists of 12 ships of tbe line, 15 frigates, and 
40 smaller vessels. The revenue of the government is estimated at 20,000,0Ck) dollars. 

13. Inhabitants. The inhabitants of Egypt are various and distinct. The most numerous 
are tbe Fellahs or Arab cultivators, the descendants of the ancient conquerors, who form 
more than four fifths of the whole population. These are well-formed and active, though lean. 



They bare fine teetb, and sunkeD sparkliog eyes. The Copts are geDerally considered 

as the descendants of die mem 
Egyptians, though it is said, ibit 
(be ancient sculptures, and Itie 
skulls of the mummies, hire i 
greater resemblance to the beidi 
and features of the Nubians Uud of 
the Copts. The Copts are neirlj 
of the same color with the malti- 
toes. They have small black eyet, 
high cheek bones, shoil, elersled 
noses, large mouths, thick ti[e, 
slighl beards, and half-woolly biif- 
Some of the females are fair and 
handsome, and they are genenlty 
distinguished for a graceful ta- 
riag^. The Copts reside cbieB; 
in Upper Egypt, and do noi ex- 
ceed 160,000 souls. Besides [beie, 
there are in Egypt Arabian Graek^ 
Jews, Syrians, Armenians, '^^â–  
Syrian. Egyptian Woman. Kurd. and Albanians, Frank?, Eojlp 

ans, &c. .1' 

The Mamtlvkci, till lately, were a fourth race of people that inhabited Egypt. This Â«>Â»â–  
ordinary race consisted of Georgian and Circassian slaves, who, under the Fatimite KMui 
were brought into the country, and being trained to arms became part of the 
of the state. They were thus enabled to rise against their masters, to mas 
them, and to assume the dominion of Egypt. By an unheard of caprice they tr 
power, not to their children, whom they despised and neglected on account 
reared in a harem, but to new bands of slaves, brought from the same place, a 
manner as themselves. They were the rulers, indeed, but might with mor 
styled the plunderers of Egj'pt, filling it with scenes of violence, and exlon 

without affording any of those henefits or that protection which a governmei.. -. 

subjects. They excelled, however, in feats of arms, and formed the best cavalrj is Â» 



â–  EGYFt. Oft 

Turkish empire. They nukle b most rigo- 
rous resistance to the best troofs of France, 
but were considerably brolcea by repeated 
defeats during tbe invasion by that power. 
Afler the evacuation of Egypt by tbe Brit- 
ish, a war of esterminatJon ives waged by tbe 
Turks against the Mamelukes. Ali Pashi 
baviog succeeded in drirlnglfaem from Ibrim, 
where they made their last sMnd, compelled 
them io retreat lo Dongola the capital of Nu- 
bia, end, still more recently, into Darfur, 
where it is probable they will soon beconw 
extinct. 

14. Drt$$. The modes of dress are at 
TBnous as the classes of people, and the co>- 
tume of many nations gives a lively appear- 
ince to the streets of Cairo. The usual dress has considerable resemblance to that of Turkey. 
The Arabs, nbo are tbe most numerous class, wear trowsers of blue or white cotton, and a 
long tunic of tbe same. Those who are able wear a red woolen cap. Turbans also are worn. 
Tbe females in public are closely veiled. The present ruler, however, has made great efforts 
to introduce the European costume, and many of tbe inhabilaats have substituted the hat for 
tbe cap, and retrenched the fulness of tbeir dress. 

1 5. Langaage. The common language is the Arabic, and among merchants tbe Kngtta 
franca. The Coptic is the most ancient tongue, but it is not spoken. It is used by tbe 
Copts in norship, and there is in it a version of the Scriptures. It is the oldest language, 
being that of the ancient Egyptiuis, though it is mixed with Greek and Arabic. 

16. Manner of Building. In the towns, tbe bouses are generally square, with flat roofs, 
and built without much regard to elegance. Many of the Arabs live in tents, or rude huta. 
The Arabs of Goornoo live in the passages of the ancient tombs, which they divide with par- 
tiiions of clay. 

17. Pood and Drink. Egypt is the land of abundance. In many places, there are 3 har< 
rests. Food is extremely cheap, and yet many inhabitants suffer under privations The 
common food is pilau, or boiled rice and rancid butter, bread of millet, and dates. Some 
mutton and poultry is consumed, and much bufTalo-milk. The water is (bat of the Nile, col- 
lected in cisterns. It is considered very salubrious. Raktt is consumed in considera- 
ble Quantities, and many driok it to intoxication. Smoking ts as general as i( is in Turkey. 
Id Upper Egypt, 1,000 eggs, or 14 fowls, may he purchased for a dollar. The same sum, 
will purchase a great number of pigeons. 

18. Diteattt. Tbe mosf 
common .diseases are fayarocele 
and ophthalmia ; the most fatal, 
plague, dysentery, and fevers. 
European physicians are in great 
request ; though barbers are 
generally the chief suFgeons. 
Charms and amulets are resorted 
to, in cases of disease. 

19. Travtling. Thegeneral 
mode of traveling, is on csmels, 
horses, or in boats on the Nile. 
Tbe caravans will be described 

I under Asia. At present, trav- 

elers may go safely, though not 
with much comfort, to the most 
interesting ruins, including The- 
bes, Slwah, and Elephaniiue. 

20. Character, Manntrt, &c. 
~*^* C a m mrtubtfint^. Tbe people are so various, (bai 

67 



â€¢ 
ihe custom* me ihereAnre diSbrwaXj to the tlifferent cladses. Tlie Arabs are cbc^ul, qwt, 
and have many good qualities. "The Jews are filthy and avaricious. Tfaey, with the Cofb, 
are geuerally paercbants and officers of the customs. The Bedouins, or pastoral Arabs, ire 
warlike and freie, living by plunder, as much as by industry. The inhabitants of tbe citiaae 
indolent and sensual. They have little employment, and their amusements are of a depnyj^ 
kind. Women are veiled and. secluded, as in all oriental countries, but they have stifl oradi 
freedom. Beauty is esteemed by weight, as in many Mahometan countries. The moden 
Egyptians are so inert, that they have hardly a national character. They have many tbi^ia 
common with the mass of orientals. The Copts are dexterous and adroit, and receive sdE* 
cient education for clerks and accounAmts, find they generally fill these offices. As in otber 
Mahometan countries, tbe Christian remarks various trifling practices, totally at variance witli 
chose to which he has been accustomed. He will remark, that the beard is worn, and tbehir 
shaven ; that the men wear petticoats and tr^wsers, and the women trowsers. Fingers supplj 
the place of forks, a cushion is used instead of a chair, and a tray, instead of a table, is set 
upon the floor. To inquire for the health of the ladies of a family, is a mortal aflfroot to tbe 
naster, and to praise his cbiMreo, 16 to be suspected of fascination, and the ^^ evil eye." Fe- 
males hide their faces, and diaplay their bosoms. Many things seem to be studiously adbetd 
to, because they are at variance with European usage* The morality and religion differ n 
less than the manners ; and an EagtishmaD, says Madden, calls oriental courage, ferocitj ; n> 
Kgion, fanaticism ; wisdom, craft ; policy, perfidy ; philosophy, taciturnity ; dignity, im- 
gance ; sentiment, sensuality. Oa the other hand, a Mahometan considers European mora% 
to be infidelity ; science, witchcraft ; precaution, impiety ; peacefuhiess, imbecility, &c 

21. â€¢Smu$enUfUB. In Cairo, the inhfibitants delight in the exhibitions of wrestlers, fop^ 
dancers, &c. Swimmink is a cotntton amusement, and it is common to see^a party of yooik, 
awimraing far into tbe Nile, to visit a distant village. Sometimes they float downwards, oe 
their backs, holdidg a pipe in their mouth. The exhibitions of the serpent-charmers are ter- 
rific. They handle the serpents with perfect familiarity, and are seldom bitten, or bate de- 
frived tbe reptiles of the power to do harm. The dancing women are numerous. Tbejper* 
K>mi in public, and also in tbe harems. Their exhibitions conform to the state of moral seoi- 
ment, and are, of course, such as would not be tolerated in Europe. 

22. Eduet^n. Among otber means of raiding tbe character oif the people, the present rokr 
has established a college at Boulak, near Cairo, which, several years since, had 700 students. 
Various books were translated for tbe use of the institution, and instruction given in the Freod 
and Italian languages. The genend mass of the people, however, are sunk in ignorance. Tbe 
arts are in a state equally low. 

23. Religion. The generd religion is the Mahometan. Tbe Copts, however, profes 
Christianity,*though they practise circumcision. They have auricular confession. Maniages 
are generdly contracted by the intervention of friends, and frequently the parties do oot see 
each other till the ceremony. The wedding is attended with rejoicings. The females an 
jfAon married at 1 5, and at an earlier age, and are past their prime soon after 20. 

t4. Government and Lawi. Egypt is under the rule of a Pacha, nominally subject lo 
'Turkey, but substantially independent. Ali Pacha, the late ruler, passed many good and usefol 
â€¢lawfif but the country is, nevertheless, much depressed. Various losses had compelled Mn to 
raise a revenue from the small gains of the industrious, and tbe Fellahs receive so little of tiw 
crops, that they would cease to cultivate the earth, unless compelled to plant and to sell tbe 
.produce to the Pacha. Of coarse, he sets the price ; and, moreover, makes a part of the pay- 
ment in his own merchandise. Ali mistook the resources of the country, and the disposition of 
the people in establishing his immense manufactories of cotton. Agriculture is tbe true weahb 
of Egypt, and the muiufectures hive impoverished the country. To Egypt belong, beside the 
country of Egypt proper, part of Nubia and Nigritia, and the ble of Candia. Syria aod 4e 
Arabian provinces have been restored to Turkey. These possessions contain about 400,000 
square mUea, and 400,000,000 inhabitants. 

25. AntiqmUei. Egy^it is to be seen in the past more than in the present ; in the vast ain 
wonderful masses, shaped by labor and art into structures, that defy tbe power of time. Â£v*T' 
thing raised by the ancient Eigyptians seemed to be designed for the latest P^st^T* 
;ihe designs wefe vast, all their remaining edi6ces present a sort of barbaric grandeur. Tte >*â€¢ 
chanical labors and monuments of the ancient Egyptians were designed wholly for poa^ ^ 
jhow, liitlt io itbe spirit of modem times. The traveler, laadiqg at Alesupdria, will see, aiaoRf 



other niJaa, Uss fistiiict, tbe pillar which bean the nama of Fompsy, and the obelisk, 
called Clflopatoa's Needle. Alexandria has other magni&ceDt remains, such as prosirate 
rows of marble columns, and mutilaKd capr- 
tals. Pompey'spiUar stands upon a pedestal, 
13 feet high. The shaft is roond, and, with 
the Corinthian capital, 100 feet in height. 
The diameter is 9 feet. Cteopatra'a Needle 
is of one shaft, of granite, covered with hiero- 
glyphics. It is about 64 feet high, and 8 feet 
square at the base. The ruins of Alexandria 
would, in any countnr but Egypt, be, them- 
selves, antiquities ; but, in (be country of 
ibe pyramids, tfaey are comparMively recent. 
Tbcwe are great numbers of pyramids scattered 
ever I^pt, but tbe most remarkable are those 
of Djizeh, Bakbara, and Dashour. The most 
wonderful of ail are those of Djizeh. When 
ceveral leagues disunt fiom the specutor, they 
seem near at haod, and it is not tiH after hav~ 
mg traveled several miles, that be is fuHy sen- 
sible of their size. They are on the platforni 
of a rock, situated ISO feet above the level of 
tbe desert, The largest is ascribed to Che- 
ops. Ten years were consumed in preparing 
, a road, whereon to draw tbe immense blocks 

of stone, and the labors of 100,000 men were 
\ employed, who were relieved once in three 

: months. Such is the account of Herodotus. 

, Thegreat pyramid covers an area of about 11 

acres, and rises 137 feet above tbe cross of 
St. Paul's, in London, or 460 feet. The base 
is '750 feet. The pyramids face the cardinal 
points, and the entrances in those which have 
been explored, descend at exactly the same 
nmfatia'i JfttM*. angle, and at the same part of the fabric. Vari- 

ous passages and chambers have been discov- 
ered by ^Â«at labor, and wells or shafts coaducting from above to the lower apartments. The 
. entrances were artfully concealed in tbe wall, 30 feet or less above the base. Tbe passages 
were soBietimes stmiped with a solid block of granite, made, however, to slide upwards, by the 
fbree of a levw. In the Pyramid of Cephrenes, Belzom found the central chamber 46 feet 
id lef^, about 16 feet wide, and nearly S4 feet high, hewn from the solid rock. The pyra- 
Btds are oomposed of immense blocks of stone, laid upoo each other in the receding manner 
Â»f steps. It IS supposed thai these steps were formerly filled up with stones, which Inve been

Tbe site of Memphis has been disputed, for Egypt has so many ruins, ihkt ibe qaeatue 
lulght easily arise. It has, however, been decided, by finding the remains of one of the Co- 
bfisi described by Herodotus ; that is, a wrist, which shows that the entire statue must hare 
been 45 feet high. Dendera, tbe ancient Tenlyra, has some magnificent remains, particularly 
the gateway leading to tbe temple of Isis, and the temple iiself. The edifice is nearly entire. 
The portico has 24 columns in three rows, each 32 feet high, and more than 33 feet in cir- 
cumference. The sculptures have much 
expression in them, and are executed Â«kh 
great skill. All travelers unite in exMl- 
ing this temple. At Thebes, " tbe hl|Â»' 
dred gated," there is a vast extfl^^i 
ruins. Thebea is now to be'-tn â– **" 
four small hamlets, for the 
have built their villages among tb^ll 
of temples. These villages are &M 
Luxor, Medinet Abou, and Gomov. ^ 
description, or paintiag, can conn 
idea of the profusion of pillars att 
prostrate, or reclinJag against each 4 
at Karnac. These pillars are con, 
Ruiit tf TluitM "'^'' sculptures, not urniatural anS gro- 

tesque, but, though much larger than life, 
they are full of beauty and grace. The temple here has uo parallel for magnitude and beauty. 
The masses are prodigious. There are 12 principal entrances, each of which is composed 
of several propyla and colossal gateways, in themselves larger than most other temples. The 
sides of some are larger than the bases of the greater number of the pyramids of Middle 
Egypt. On each side of many of these are colossal statues of granite, and basalt, from SO to 
80 feel high. Of tbe avenues of sphynxes, that lead to the temple, across tbe plain, one ex- 
tends 2 miles nearly to the temple at Luxor. There are other columns before the traveler 
reaches the body of the temple, after which are 4 beautiful obelisks, marking the entrance (o 
the adytum. The sanctuary has 3 apartments of granite. The roof of the central room, 
which is 20 feet long, and 16 wide, is composed of 3 blocks of granite, for the arch was 
unknown to the Egyptians. The imagination can hardly embrace the magnitude of this tem- 
ple. Of the hundieds of columns, the smallest is 7^ feet in diameter. The field of ruins it a 
mile in diameter, and the temple itself, grand as it is. sinks into insignificance, when compared 
with tbe number and size of the surrounding monuments, gateways, subordinate temples, and 
rows of sphynxes. In approaching the temples of Luxor from the north, the observer comet 
first upon a stately gateway 200 feel long, and 57 feet above ibe present level of the soil. la 
&oot are two of tbe most perfect obelisks in the world, each of a single block of red grant*. 



EGYPT. 533 

â– botit-6 feet sqmre at tbe hne, ud 89

statues, also of red graniie, buried in the 
sand to tbe cbeat, but measuring 23 feet 
from thence to the top of the<r miires. 
Having passed tbe gateway, which is it- 
selfa vast monument, adorned with groups 
of good sculptures, ihe traveler enters a

of die rirer are structures equal in their style of architecture. The Memnonium, or Temple 
of Memnon, looks towards the east, and is 
fronted by a stupendous propylon, of which 
S34 feet are still remainii^. The alatae of 
Memnon is overthrown and shattered. It was 
26 feet broad between the shoulders, 54 feel 
round tbe cbest, and 13 from the shoulder to

by many writers who heard it, but the reasoo.it 
is bard to explain. The Necropolis or city of 
tbe dead, is connected with the great Egyptian 
capital. The mountains were hollowed out for 
the tombs of the inhabitants. These excavated 
mountains contain halls and rooms innumerable. 
The walls are freshly painted, and some of the 
sarcophagi were monundents of art. The mum-

of the country has passed sticcessivdv through the hands of its native princes, the Greeks, Sa- 
mara, Saracens, and Turks. It was invaded by the French, under Bonaparte, in 1798 ; bu a 
1801, the country submided to the British, and at the peace of Amiens, it was resiored to tit 
Ottoman Porte. Ali Pacha was compelled by the allied powers to acknowledge ibÂ« sow- 
cignty of Turkey, but Egypt is substantially independent.

CHAPTER LXXXIV, AFRICAN ISLANDS. 

1 . Op the African island^) some lie in the Eastern or Indian Ocean, and some in tbe Weat- 
era, or Atlantic. We shall be|;in with those in the Indian Ocean ; the chief of which are^ 
Socotra, the Comoro islands, Madagascar, Mauritius, and Bourbon. 

2. Socotra is situated 30 lewies to the eastward of Cape GuardeAu. It is 80 nu'Ies loa^, 
^gkd 50 broad^ and has 2 good harbors. It is very i^ell peopled, and yields most of the fruitp 
and plants, which are usually found witbb the tropics, with frankincense, gum-tragacanth, an4 
aloes. The inhabitants are of Arabian extraction, and are under the government of a prince^ 
or abeik, who is dependent upon the Imam of Mascat. 

3L The Conwro hUf are five : Joanna, Mayotu, Mohilla, Angazei, and Comoro. TbQ 
Gimd Comoro is 50 miles ^m%% ftod 15 broad, and is chiefly composed of ipountains, whicii 
unite near tbe centre^ where the summit is about 7,500 Â£eet in height. Joanna, or Uinzuao, la 
about dO miles Ipng, and 15 broad, and affords plenty of provisions and tropical fruit. The 
inhabitants are PVtly of Arabian descent, and partly of African origin, and are, in general, mild 
ipd hiimane. This .^oup was forn^erly popmoua and flourishing, hut is now rendered almost 
({esohte, by the piratical mcursions of Madeoassee pirates, who have carried ofl!* great numbera 
of the inhabitants, as slaves. MmiraUy iUe#, to tbe northeast, are a group of 1 1 uninhabited 
i^^ts, belonging to the English, which are merely visited for catching turtles. Tbe S$ytkeUm 
ife a cluster of 30 islets, also belonging to the English. 

4. MadagoMcar is the hu'gjest of the African islands, being above 900 miles in length, bom 
qortb to south, and generally between 200 and 300 miks broad, with an area of 200,000 square 
loiles. It is traversied by a lofty chain of mouataias, somf of the summits of which reach \bt^ 
height of 11,000 feet. The sea rolls with great rapidity, and b extremely rough, between this 
taland and the oontioeot, (orming a channel or passage, through which European ships, in th(Btr 
wnge Is and from Ipdta, freouently sail. 

Mttdagfscar is a ploaaant and fertile conatry, abounding in si^r, honey, fruit-irefs, valuabte 
gams, corn, cattle, noultry, precious stones, iron, some silver, copper, and tin. It afibrda wpk 
apeeable variety or hiUa,, valle{ysÂ« woods, and plains ( and it is watered by nnmenQus rivms. 
Xfie air is generally temperate, and said to be very healthy, though hi a hot climate. Amonft 
tM inhabitants are white and black tribes, and also peojple of color. The whites, and those oT 
li tawny complexion, who inhabit tb? coasts, are the ofispring of the Arabs, as b evident from 
t|Mr language and their religiouf rites ; but here are no mosques or temples, nor any stated 
iVtfahin, except that they offer sacrificea of beasts on particular occasioDe ; as when sick, when 
tkey plant ^a|us or rice, when they hold their asiembliea, circumcbe their children, declare 
iffir, enter mio new-built houses, or bury their dead. Some of their ceremonies and practicea 
resemble tbe Jewbh, whence il bad been conjectured, that they are the posterity of Jews, who 
formerly setiled here. But the Madecassees, who are of Malay extraction, form the bulk of 
tbe ipbabitants. Some of the black tribes have woolly hair, but whether they are the abori- 
dnea, or of African origin, b unknowp. This island was discovered by the Portuguese, and 
3e French took possession of it in 1641 ; but, the people disliking the government, they were 
c&iven out in 1652 ; since which time, the natives have had, with the exception of a few set* 
llements of Europeans, tbe tole possession of tbe island, under a number of pet^ princes, who 
OMke war upon eifeh other (or slaves and plunder. In 1828, the kingdom of Madagascar was 
a powerful state, which had reduced to subjection the greater part of the island ; the prince 
waa an intelligent man, who sought to civilize hb subjects by inviting missionaries into the 
kingdom, and sending some youoÂ£ men into European countries to be educated. He had, also^ 
introduced horses and firearms mto his army, which was organized oa the European model 
But he was unfortunately poboned by his queen, and hb death waa a signal for insurrection 
m^ eivil war. 

5. Mauritiw was so called by tbe Dutch (who first touched here in 1598), in honor of 
pcioce Maurice, their stadtfaolder ; but it b now ^nerally styled the Isle of France. It is 
ahout 400 miles east of Madagascar. It is of an oval form, about 140 miles in oirciunferencei 
with a fine harbor, secure against any wind that blows, and 100 fathoms deep at the entrance. 
Tbe climate b healthy and pleasant. The mountains, of which there are many, and some sa 
Ugli) that their tofa are covered with snow, produce excellent ebonv, beside varions other 
kuds of valuable wood, two of wbic^ greatly reaeadrfe ebonf in quahty ; ont md, the otbei

jallow. Tbe island is well watered, and tboogh the soil is not tbe most fruitfid, jields pko^ 
of tobacco, rice, fruit, cotton, indigo, sugar, and cloves, and feeds a great number of emk^ 
deer, goats, and sbeep. It was formerly subject to the Dutch ; but the French gained pai- 
session of it ip 1715. B7 the English it was taken in 1810, and is still in their possesaiea. 
Population, 100,000, three fourths of whom were slaves, previous to the general emancipate 
in the British colonies. 

6. Bourbon is situated about 300 miles east of Madagascar, and is about 90 miles in circuit. 
There are many good roads for shipping, round Bourbon, particularly on the .north and soodi 
sides ; but hardly a single harbor, where ships can ride secure against those hurricaoes, #falcb 
blow during the monsoons. Indeed, the coast is so surrounded with blind rocks, sunk a few 
feet below the water, that coasting is at all times dangerous. On the southern estremity b 1 
volcano, which continually throws out flames and smoke, with a hideous roaring noise. The 
climate, though extremely hot, is healthy, being refreshed wilh cooling gales, that blow in the 
anorning and evening, from the sea and land ; sometimes, however, terrible hurricanes shdw 
the whole island almost to its foundations ; but, generally, without any other bad consequence, 
than frightening the inhabitants. The island abounds in springs and brooks, and prodaces 
iloes, white pepper, ebony, palm, and other kinds of wood, and fruit-trees. Many of tlie 
trees yield odorilerous gums and resins, particularly benzoin of an excellent sort, in great fdee- 
ty. The rivers are well stocked with fish, the coast with land and sea tortoises, and everj 
^rt of the country with homed cattle, as well as hoes and goats. Ambergris, ccyral, and the 
most beautiful shells, are found upon the shore. The woods are full of turtle-doves, perro- 
quets, pigeons, and a great variety of other birds, beautiful to the eye, and pleasant to tbe pri- 
ate. The French first settled here in 1672 ; and, though they were dispossessed of tbe island 
by the English, in the last war, they regained it by the treaty of peace. Population, 100,000, 
most of whom are slaves. 

7. The following islands lie on the western coast. The Guinea Islands. In tbe Ghilf of 
Guinea are several islands, the largest of which are St, Thomas^ Princess Island^ and JtmaMb 
Po. The first 2 belong to tbe Portuguese. On Fernando Po, the British have formed a 
settlement. 

8. SL flefena stands entirely detached from Any group, and about 1,200 miles from die 
aearest land, on the coast 6f Southern Africa ; latitude 15^ 55' S. ; longitude 5^ 49^ W. h 
is 10} miles long, by 6} broad, and about 28 miles in circumference. It presents to the sea, 
throughout its whole circuit, nothing but an immense wall of perpendicular rock, from 600 to 
1,200 feet high, like a castle in the midst of the ocean. There are only 4 openings in the 

Sreat wall of rock which surrounds St. Helena, by which it can be approached with any 
icility. These are all strongly fortified. The climate is moist, and liable to strong gusts of 
wind. The principal plain in the island, called Longwoody has become celebrated by tbe resi* 
dence of Napoleon, who died here in 1821. His tomb is in a secluded recess, and is sur- 
rounded by a fence, inclosing a piece of ground containing weeping willows. St. Helena was 
granted to tbe English East India Company, by Charles the Second, and still remains in tbeir 
possession. It is frequently resorted to as a place of refreshment, by vessels returning from 
India. Jiscsnsion is a small island, situated to tne northwest of St. Helena, in latitude 8^ 8r Q^ 
longitude 14^ 28^ W. It is entirely barren and destitute of water, but has an excellent har- 
bor and abounds in fish, sea-fowl, and turtles. It is occupied by fbe Britisb government if a 
miliury station. The island of St. Matthew lies north of Ascension, in latitude 1^ 24' 8^ 

9. The Cape'Verde hlands^ further north, are so called from a cape of that name, neartte 
river Gambia, over against which they lie, at the distance of 300 miles. They were first.db* 
covered in 1460, by the Portuguese, and are about 20 in number ; but some of them, bdhg 
only barren, uninhabited rocks, are unworthy of notice. Sant-Iago, Antonio, and Nicola/|ffp 
the most considerable. One is a mere volcano, and is therefore called Fogo. The air tt 
quently very hot, and, in some of these islands, very unwholesome. They are inhabit 
Europeans, or the descendants of Europeans, and negroes. 

Sant-Iago is 140 miles in circuit, and is the most fruitful ; yet it is mountainous, 
much barren land in it. Its produce is sugar, cotton, some wine, Indian com, coci 
oranges, and other tropical fruits, plenty of roots, and garden vegetables ; but the plant of 1 
consequence, is the madder, which grows in abundance among the clifi^s. Praya is on 
side of the island, has a good port, and is seldom without ships, those outward-bound to Guinea, 
or to the East Indies, often touching here for water and refreshments.

Â« 



Iq the i^nd of Mayo, belonging to this group, tramenBe quantide* of salt are made by the 
Hat of the BUn, from the sea-water , which, at spring-tides, is received ioto a son of pan, form- 
id by a sand-bank, tbat runs along the coast for several miles. Here the Kngltsb and Aineri- 
Â»ns carry on a considerable trade, for salt. The salt costs nothing, except for raking it to- 
;ether, wheeling it out of the pond, and carrying it on astes to the boats, which is done at a 
rery cheap-rate. Asses are also an article of trade at this island, whence ,tbey are conveyed 

the West Indies. These islands are subject to great droi^hts ; during which the thin, dry 
loil, yields no harvests, and the inhabitants suffer all the horrors of famme. They belong to 
Portugal. 

10. The (^anaria, anciently called the Fonunate Islands, are situated at the distance of 
50 miles southwest of Morocco. Tbeir particular names are, tbe Grand Cauarj, Teneriffe, 
!*alma, Gomera, Hierro or Ferro, Fuerie-Ventura, and LanceroU. These islands enjoy a 
Mire, temperate air, and abound in the most dolicions fruit, especially grapes, from which a 
ich species of wine is made. Tbe Canaries also produce those beautiful birds, which bear 
heir name, and are now so common in Europe and America. They belong to Spain. 

Teneriffe, the largest island of this group, is about 120 miles in circuit ; a fruitful countiy, 
ibounding in corn, wine, and oil, though it is encumbered with mouniaius. The highest poial 
s called the Peak, or Pic. The ascent to this elevated spot, is not so very hazardous or dif- 
icult as it was long imagined to be. From Oraiava a deep ravine commences ; a chestniK 
(H>est then appears, covering tbe flanks of those moudtains, which form a central chain across 
be bland. A series of verdant hills follow ; after which the track leads across a steep mass 
if lava rock, worn into ravines, and eshibiiing a thin surface of yellow pumice. At length aq 
â– adulated plain spreads itself, like a fan, to a great extent, until it terminates in the second 
egion of the peak and a range of precipices. A steep mountain of pumice is next ascended, 
ind varied masses of lava require to be passed, before the summit of this siago of the moui)> 
un is attained. The foot of^the cone is then reached ; and the subsequent ascuit is rendered 
roublesome and fatiguing by the excessive steepness of tbe cone. Tbe feet of adventurous 
'isiiers sink into the ashes at every step, and tiuantitiea of pumice and lava are rolled down , 
ipoD them. Of the highest part, the superficial extent is about an acre and a half; and this 

1 itsdf a small crater, m which sulphureous heat is observable. Tbe height of the Fie is cal- 
nilated at 13,000 feet. Santa Cna is the capital of Teneriffe, and tbe seat of govemmaBt 
or all the seven islands. Though not large, it is a well-built city, with 8,000 inhabitants. 
Lagwia exceeds it in magniiude, but has a mean appearance. Out of 150,000 persons, who 
iorm the whole population of the Canaries, 60,000 may be assigned to Teneriffe. 

Fuerte-Vintura is larger than the Grand Canary ; but it scarcely contains 9,000 inhabiiaoti, 
nhile the latter has about 45,000. One island is remarkable for drought ; ihe other has a 
nifficient supply of moisture to produce such fertility, tbat there are two, and sometimes three, 
liarvesis of wheat and maize in one year ; hence the Great Canary is celled tbe granary of the 
iuulai group. Poinuti, the chief town of the latter, iias 10,000 inhabitants. 

11. Madtira is about 60 miles long and 40 broad, and consists of one co.itinued hill of a 

considerable height, extending from 
east to west ; tbe declivity of which, 
on the south side, is cultivated, and 
ioterspersed with vineyards. In tbe 
nidstof this slope the mercbanis hard 
fixed their country-seats, which form 
a very agreeable prospect. Tba 
chief town, named Funehal, stands 
on the southern side of the island ; 
toward the sea, it is defended by a 
bigh wall with a battery, and it is tbs 
01^ place where it is possible for a 
boat to land ; and even there tbe 
beacb is covered with large stones, 
and violent surf continually beats up- 
.on it> Of the bay, on which the 
town borders, the extremities are

are ntmieroos ; but they are not remarkable for beauty or magoificeiiGe, thou^ soni^ 
mere particukrly the cathedral, are richly deeomted. The populalioo of the town is iT 
90)000 ; and of the whole island, 98,800. This islaad is bdd by the Portuguese, aad; 
duces wine and fruit in great abusdanet. It is less fruitRil in corn, from the rocky natQtj 
the soil. Sugar-canes used to thrive in it ; but they are not at present much cultivated. T 
inhabitants make excellent sweetmetfa, and have the art of presenriag citrons and oranjesti 
making marmahMk and perfooied pastes, which exceed those of Geooa. The littb sug^r ^9 
make is very fine, and has a fragrant odor. This, indeed, is saU to be the first place ialv 
west where that manufacture was set on foot ; whence it was carried to Brazil. 

The climate of Madeira is v)ery hot for a great part of the jBUtf but is so far from 
msalubrious, that invalids resort to it from other countries ; aod^ not^ithstauding its hea^; 
remarkably free from venomous animals. It has a rainy seaspy, which necessarily vr-^

over the island, and swelled the rivulets to such an excess^ tbait dreadful inundations 
The country, and the environs of the eity, were ravaged by the torrents ; houses an< 
were washed away, and many lives were lost*

MI&OBLLANEOUS NOTES. 



The Setif^ ManHe contains few islands ef ao^ sise, and no Unto of anjr eonse^ueacei H 
Â§m MrA JiUaniic abounds in large istaods, and u deep and numeroos inland seas* whick pen^ 
Mte (kr on each side into both tfae oU and new worlds, and have fitted it for the meat axtai^ 
the commerce on the jglobe. On its easOem shores it receives (mn laige rivecs except ihaK- 
ger ; but on the west it receives the Plata, Orinoco, Amason, Miasiasippi, and St Lawni^ 
*â€” the hirgest rivers on the face of the eardi. 

The tÂ«rtiaZ color which sea-water exlribits is a bkiish green, of various shades. 6eae aah 
lÂ»n, that this is its true and nroper color ; others, that it is an optical illusion, oocasiooad kf 
Ae greater refranglbility of toe Uue n^s of light, â€” opbions which may both be true to â€¢ â‚¬9* 
taia extent. The ocean seems often to ftssume various other colors ; some of them no (bah 
real, but as often illusory. Among die more general soiu-ces of deception, may be recifODed 
the aspect of the sky ; thus, an apparently dark-colored sea is a common prognosdc of an ap* 
proaching storm ; not that the water then is really blacker than usual, but tne dark coh)r of the 
clouds indistinctly seen in or reflected fiiom the waves, is mistaken for the color of the set itseV 

The variety of color f in the sea nay probably arise from animal and vegetable matters diffa 
ed through the waters m a putrescent state, and communicating various tints. The yeUowvl 
bright green shades seem to be owing to living marine vegetaUes, which grow at tne bottOA) 
stretch their fibres through the water, or spread over the siirface. 

The phospkoresctnee of the sea is a common but very remarkable phenomenon, concsrstf 
the cause of which authors are not agreed. But most probably, as Newton conjectured, it Jt^-

bended by Gallileo, and ouiers. The eighth and outemioet satellite of Satom, Japetus, was 
diÂ»covered in 1671 ; the fi^h, JBlhaa, in 1673 ; and tbe third, Teth]/r, and fourth, Dion, in

May 13, 1781, Sir Wiltiam-Harschel discovered a new primary planet exterior to Sat- 
urn, and now known by his name, or more commonly callea TIraitut. In 1797, he 
discovered two satellites of tbat planet, tbe second and louttb in diatance from it In 
1789, he dJBCoveied the two satellites of Saturn, JUtnot, and thucladus, nearest to that 
planet. In 1790, he diwovered tbe first and Siih, and In 1794, tbe sixth and the third 
sateUites of UraoM. 



8 ASTRONOMICAL DISCOVERIES. 

Kepler had long ago pointed out something like a regtdar progression in the distances 
of the planets as far as Mars, between which and Jupiter there intervened a distance of 
no less than 350,000,000 of miles, in which no planet was then known to exist; and bad 
suggested the existence of another planet in that space. This idea of relative dlstanoe 
seemed to be confirmed by the discovery of Uranus, and Kepler's notions -were revhcd 
by Bode, of Berlin, who concluded from the relations of all the known planets to thdr 
nearest neighbors, (that of Jupiter and Mars to each other excepted), that the distanoe 
of each planet from the Sun is about double that of the next interior one, and half that 
of the next exterior one. Guided by this rule, which, roughly speaking, held good as to 
the mutual relations of all the known planets, except Mars and Jupiter, the space in the 
heavens between them, where agreeably to Bode's law, an undiscovered planet ought to 
exist, was rigorously examined ; and not without success. 

The small primary planet Ceres, intermediate between Mars and Jupiter, and in a 
position pretty conformable to Bode's law was discovered by Piazzi at Palermo, Jan. 1, 
1801 ; Pallas, another small planet by Olbers, at Bremen, March 18, 1802 ; Jitno, a 
third, by Harding, at Silienthal, Sept 1, 1804 ; Vesta, a fourth, by Olbers, at Bremen, 
March 29, 1805. 

The number of known principal planets was thus raised to 11, and of secondary plan- 
ets to 18, or 29 in all, â€” at which numbers they stood for 38 years, and till after the publi- 
cation of the work to which this is a supplement Olbers had continued a systematic 
search for eight years after the discovery of Vesta, but without finding any additional 
planets. He dropped it in 1816, and for 14 or 16 years the subject attracted little atten- 
tion. The search was resumed about 1830, by M. Hencke, an amateur astronomy at 
Dreissin in Prussia, and after 16 years of diligent survey, assbted by the Berlin chart of 
the heavens, he commenced in lo46 a new career of planetary discovery,' by which the 
number of principal planets has been more than doubled, and which does not appear to 
have yet come to an end. ^ 

Towards the close of that year, Dec. 8th, he discovered Astraea, a fifth member of the 
group of small planets or asteroids situated between Mars and Jupiter, and of which 
only four had hitherto been known. Following up the search, a sixth of these small plan- 
ets, named Hebe, was found by the same astronomer, July 1, 1847. Other observen 
bad now engaged in the search, and Aug. 13th, of the same year Iris, and Oct 18th, 
Flora, two new members of the group were discovered by Mr* Hind of London, hav- 
ing charge of a private observatory erected by Mr. Bishop, in the grounds of his private 
residence in Regent's Park. On the 25th of April, 1848, Metis, a ninth asteroid was 
discovered by IVG. Graham at the private observatory of Morkin Woth, in Ireland. Dt 
Anabal de Gasparis, assistant astronomer at the royal observatory at Naples, discovered 
a tenth, April 12, 1849, called Hygeia, and an eleventh called Parthenope, on the Uth 
of May, 1850. On the 13th of September of the same year. Hind discovered a 12th 
called VICTORIA, and Nov. 2nd, G(asparis added a 13th, named Egeria. On the 19tb of 
May, 1851, Hind found a 14th called Irene, which was also discovered four days later 
by (Jasparis at Naples, who, on the 29th of July following, found a 15th called Euno- 
MIA, and on the 17th of March, 1852, a 16th called Psyche. Just a month later, on the 
17th of April, a 17th called Thetis was discovered by Luther of Bilk, in Gtermany ; on 
the 24th of June, an 18th called Melpomene, by Huid ; on the 22d of August, a i9th 
by Hind, called Fortuna ; on the 9th of September, a 20th by Charconnac, of Ma^ 
seilles, called Massilia; on the 16th of Nov. a 21st by Hind, called Calliope; on the 
25th of Nov., a 22d by Groldschmidt at Paris, called Lutetia ; and on Dec 15th, a 23d, 
also by Hind, called Thalia. The discovery of a 24th, called Phocea, was made 
April D, 1853, by Charconnac of Marseilles, and of a 25th, on the 5th of May, 1853, by 
Luther of Bilk. 

These rapid discoveries of telescopic planets, are less to be ascribed to perfection of 
telescopes, though great improvements have been made in these instruments, than to tiic 
industry and dexterity of tne observers, and especially to the improved charts of the 
heavens, enlarged by the addition of fixed stars of the ninth and tenth magnitudes, none 
of these planets shining with more light than stars of the eighth magnitude, and several 
of them being still fainter. 



ASTRONOMICAL DISCOVBRIBS- 9 

The diatandive characteristics of the planets of this group between Mors and Jnpiter 
are, first* their small size, â€” so small thai; it is very diiSicult to measure it with any ex* 
actness ; though it is probable that the largest of them does not much exceed 600 miles 
in diameter, being thus more than 10 times less in diameter, 100 times less in surface, 
and 1000 times less in size, than the earth ; second, their interlacing orbits, and the incli* 
nation of these orbits to the plane of the ecliptic, which ri^es from 3 deg. 47 min., in the 
case of Hygeia, to 13 deg. 3 min., in that of Juno, 14 deg. 47 min. in that of Hebe, 16 deg, 
33 min. in that of Egeria, and even to 34 deg. 37 min. in that of Pallas. So intimate, 
indeed, is the connection of this whole group of smcdl planets, that if the orbits are sup- 
posed to be represented as hoops, they all hang together in such a manner that the whole 
group may be replaced by any given one, that of Iris being the intermediate bond which 
unites together what, if that were unknown, would appear to consist of two separate 
groups â€” a result the more unexpected considering the wideness of the zone which these 
orbits occupy in the solax system. This singular connection of these planets has served 
to give weight to the suggestion that they are but fragments of what originally was but 
one planet, but which, by some extraordinary catastrophe, was broken up into a multitude 
of parts â€” an idea first suggested by Olbers, while as yet only Ceres and Pallas were 
known as a means of accounting for their interlacing orbits, and which led him to con- 
jecture that the discovery of other similar fragments might be expected. 

It is not alone to this remarkable group of small planets, that the triumphs of modem 
theory and observation have been limited. The observed motions of Uranus being found 
to diner iirom the orbit ascribed to it by theory, the idea was suggested that this disturb- 
ance must be caused by the attraction of some planet, as yet unknown, .exterior to iL 
Two astronomers, Mr. Adams, of St. John's College, Cambridge, and M. Le Verrier, 
an eminent French mathematician, set themselves simultaneously, though unknown to 
each other, to calculate from the known perturbation of Uranus, and from the assump- 
tion that Bode's law of relative distences would extend to the undiscovered planet to 
which those perturbations were ascribed, the place in the heavens where that planet would 
be likely to be found. In consequence of suggestions founded on the calculations of Le 
Verrier, search was made by Dr. Galle of the Koyal Observatory of Berlin, on the 23d of 
September, 1846, and in the spot indicated a new planet was found, having the bright- 
ness of a star of the eighth magnitude. But this planet, called Neptune, thus wonderfiilly 
discovered, has not proved to be at that distance from the sun which Le Verrier had 
assumed, the distance falling short of that which the law of Bode would have required, 
by more than a fourth ; nor, consequently to be of the size, nor to have the period of rota- 
tion, ascribed to it by the theoretical ejaculation which led to its discovery. A satellite 
was discovered attending on this new planet, shortly after the discovery of the planet it- 
eeUf viz. in October, 1846. Mr. CÂ«assall of Starfield, near Liverpool, has since caught 
glimpses, as he supposes, of another. An additional satellite of Saturn, Hyperion^ the 
seventh and outermost but one in distence from the plaqet, was discovered in Sep- 
tember, 1848, by Mr. Bond of the observatory at Cambrioge in the United States, and by 
Mr. Lassall of Liverp>ool two or three days later. Mr. Bond has also noted, as well as other 
astronomers, additional divbions of the ring of Saturn ; and he has shown, by an elabo- 
i^ate calculation, that this ring must be composed of a fluid and not of a solid mass. Up 
to the middle of the year 1853, the number of known primary planets amounted to thirty- 
four, including the earth and the sun, and of secondary planets to twenty, â€” including, 
however, two satellites of Herschel, never seen except by that astronomer, and the 
second satellite of Neptune, the existence of which can hardly be considered as quite 
<;ertain. This whole number of fifty-four planets, or fifty, excluding those as to 
tlie existence of which any doubt may exist, is nearly seven times greater than the num- 
ber known to the ancients, and indeed the number of known planets has been increased 
by about two-fifths within the last eight years. The astronomers have applied them- 
selves with great diligence to the calculation of the elements of these new planets; but 
of course, our knowledge on this subject is as yet defective. The extreme smallness of 
the new planets between Mars and Jupiter makes it very difficult to ascertein their di- 
ameters. The information thus far obtained is embodied m the following Table.

2. Comets. â€” - Since the discoveiy of Encke's comet, in 1819, tiieee bodies ha?e sir 
iracted much attention. Si^t are now known, indudiog Encke'8, whose orbits are con- 
fined within i^se of the planets, with periods of from 3.3 to 7.4 years, and two othen 
whose periods of revolution are shorter than that of Neptune. Up to the year 1917) 
178 had been calculated ; of which that of Encke has the shortest period, completiiigifc 
revolution in 3.3 years, while that of the comet of 1680, the Ioiu;eÂ£^ extends to 88w4 jemi 
its aphelion, or greatest distance from the sun, reeunhing to 8^ times the distance fion 
the sun to the earth, with a motion of only ten feet to the second, while its perihelion,* 
nearest approach to the sun, in 1680, was only 138,000 geographical miles from thatltf- 
minary, or nearer to it than the earth to the moofti. Not kss than aix or seven hnixM 
eomets have been observed, and the search fcnr them still continues to be csurried on viA 
much vigor. The Chinese have a list of all comets seen in that oountty since B. G^3. 
Most comets are, however, telescopic ; of which, upon an average, two or three aie dv- 
eovered annuUly. In the three centuries and a half horn, 1500to 1860, ffty4wo ht^ 
appeared visible to the naked eye.

obaenrations of those bodbes which form our sblax Â«Y6temt hare done much towards pene^ 
trating into the infinite depths of space beyond, m addition to the seven moving heat^ 
enly bodies, called planets, visH:^ to the naked eye, there present themselves to the ob^ 
servation of the same naked eye, numerous other stars Which always preserve apparent^ 
the same relative pontion to each other, with no other motion, so far as the nahed eye 
can detect, except those of apparent ones, of which they all partake in common, caused by 
the motion of the earth on its axis, and in its orbit, and by the changing direction of m 
poles. In distinption frmn the planets, these latter were called fixed star^j not so tnuGii 
it would seem originally from any idea of their immobility, as from the notion that ibef 
were fixed or infixed in a crystalline sphere, the outermost portion of the visible heavens, 
by the motion of which they were daily carried round the earth, the plsmets being otct- 
ried in like manner by interior spheres of their own. At a very early period these staÂ« 
were separated into groups, called constellations, among which the whole visible heaviens 
were mapped out, the divisions of these constellations being founded on certain fiuMnfal 
resemblances, and their names derived partly from certain animals and partly from Ite 
personages of the heathen mythology. 

More accurate knowledge as to &e position of the fixed stars and their changed Was 
introduced by catalogues of them in which their places were determined by their dis** 
tance from the great cirdes of the heavens. The earliest of these catalogues appealed 
to have been made at Alexandria in Egypt, by the Ghreek astronomers Timodiasis alid 
Arylstillus, about 2160 y^irs ago. But the oldest catalogue which has come down to 
us, is that of Hipparchus, as preserved by Ptolemy, made 2000 years ago, and whioh 
tin within about ^90 years, emteaced with some few additions made to it by subsequent 
observers, the buU: m human knowledge as to the fixed stars. This catalogue an the 
form in which we possess it, contains 1025 stars. The exactness of knowlet^ on this 
subject was greatly inereased by the industry of that exoettent and laborious obserrcK, 
Tycho Brahe, to whose labors, previous to the invention of the telescope, so much wÂ«8 
due. But althou^ the position of Beveiral brilliant southern stars unknown to Hippat^ 
ehus, Ptolemy, and even to the Arabian astronomers, and first discovered by the circom- 
aavigators of Africa and America, were given by him ; his catalogue as revised and piib-> 
fished by Kepler, contained no more than 1000 stars, less than one fifth of the number 
aetaally visible to the naked eye, which may be reckoned at from 5,000 to 5,800, allow- 
ance being made for variations in sharpness of vision* These stars visible to the naked 
eye, were classified by the old astronomeis, and still are, into six magnitudes. Of the 
whole numb^ about 30 are reckoned as of the fiorst magnitude, 35 of the second ma^ 
uitade, 190 of the third magnitude, 425 of the fourth magnitude, 1100 of the fifth mag^ 
nitnde, and 3200, or Taore than three fifths of the wIkAb number, of the sixth magm- 
tade. It must be recollected, however, that only one-half the heavens can ever be seen 
at the same moment, and that to stationary spectators, it is only on the Equator that the 
whole of the heavens ever become visible, a certain intervening region round one or the 
other pole, sinking pennaaiently below the horizon as the spectator advances into higiKr 
latitudes. 

In our temperate zone, not more than 2000 stars are ever visible at the same momclttt 
to the sweep of t^e naked eye. The common idea of the visible stars being innumerable, 
has arisen in no small measure fit>m th^ scintillation and tiieir irregular difinsioo, 
which is pretty equal over the whole heavens, though on the whole, the norUiem hemis- 
phere preponderates as well in brilliancy as in number. The discovery of tbe telesec^ 
revealed, as its powers were increased, an increasing number of fixed stars, estimated at 
13,000, of the seventh magnitude, 40,000 of the eighth magnitude, and 142,000 of the 
ninth magnitude â€” or in the whole up to this limit about 200,000, being one star for each 
â€¢pace of the heavens of the apparent size of the moon ; of which number upwards of 
60^00 have been observed and noted, and tiieir places recorded in charts and catalogues 
This result will explain why in any given latitude the moon does not more frequeiitiy 
soneeal stars visible to the naked eye. JÂ£ the calcnlations of the occultations of stass 
were extended to those of the ninth magnitude, a stellar eclipse would occur on an 
average every 44 J minutes, that being the time which the moon takes to traverse a por*

tion of the heavens equal in extent to its own snrfaee* But these 200,000 stars of tk 
ninth magnitade and upwards, (the ninth magnikide being about the apparent size of 
the asteroids between Mars and Jupiter in telescopes of moderate power,) are but a yery 
small part of the total number of stars which the tdescope reveak to us. Under powÂ»* 
fhl instruments, the whole milky way is resolved into masses of small stars, which 
though not separately perceptible by the naked eye, or by glasses of inferior power, do 
yet, by their united rays, become visible as a bright nebulous circle, encompassing* the 
whole heavens at an angle to the Equator of 63 deg. This remarkable hebnlonsbeb, 
which the telescope shows to be composed of stars, the number of which is estimated 
by Sir William Herschel, who spent years in their study and observation, at no less than 
1d,000,000, does not form quite a great circle, since it divides the sphere into two some> 
what unequal parts, whose areas are nearly as 8 to 9, the smaller part containing the sum* 
mer solstice. 

The milky way varies considerably in breadth in different parts of its course; in its 
narrowest, and at the same time, most brilliant portion, nearest to the antarctic pole, 
its width is nearly three or four degrees. In other parts it is 16 deg., and in its divided 
portion as much as 22 deg. The milky way may be considered as being to the siderial 
world, what the ecliptic is to our solar system of planets â‚¬md comets, a plane or ring to 
which all the fixed stars, both those in it, and those out of it may be referred. 

In the field of view of powerful telescopes, the milky way appears as diversified in its 
siderial contents as it is irregular and indefinite in its outline and limit when seen by tk 
unassisted eye. While in some parts, it exhibits, throughout a great space, the greatest 
uniformity in ihe light and apparent magnitudes of the stars, in others the most 
brilliant patches of closely clouded luminous points are interrupted by granular 
or reticular darker intervals, containing but few stars ; and in some of these intervak 
in the interior of the milky way, not the smallest star (of the 18th or 20th mag^ 
nitude) is to be discovered, ^e field presenting a perfectly YAa^k fl^>pearanoe. In exam- 
ining the milky way with a field of view of 15 deg. ^nearly twice the apparent diameter 
of the moon,) fields presenting on an average 40 or 50 stars, are almost instantly aae- 
ceeded by others with from 400 to 500. Stars of the hi^er magnitudes often occur ii 
the midst of the most minute telescopic stars, while all me intermediate classes are s^ 
sent But perhaps those stars which we regard as belonging to the lowest orders of mag- 
nitudes, do not always appear as such, solely on account of their enormous distance, bÂ«t 
also because they actually have a smaller volume or less development of light The 
space-penetrating power of instruments â€” and according to the calculations of Sir Wil- 
liam Herschel, a 20 feet instrument ]>enetrates to a distance which would take light, 
which moves at the rate of 193,000 miles a second, 12,000 years to traverse ; while a 46 
feet telescope penetrates more than three times as farâ€” is sufficient to resolve, in majij 
parts of the milkv way, the whole star-cloud, and to show the separate luminous points 
projected on the daric starless ground of the heavens. It leads us, says Sir William He^ 
schel, '^ irresistibly to the conclusion, that in these regions we see fairiy through the 
starry stratum, a stratum when the sheet is composed of stars nearly of the same size, 
of no great thickness, compared with the distance which sepsirates them from us." Id 
otiier portions of the heavens, the existence of a starry stratum, shining at a remote 
distance behind all the stars visible, even with the largest instruments, is announced 
by a uniform dotting or stippling of the field of vision. 

It follows from the examinations of the two Herschels in the northern and southen 
hemispheres, that as we depart from the milky way in either direction towards what maj 
be called its poles, the number of stars rapidly diminishes. If indeed we limit our inves- 
tigations to the bright stars, those of the first three or four classes of magnitudes, and 
those therefore which particularly attracted the attention of the earliest observers, we 
shall find them distributed on the whole with tolerable unifonnitv, although in the sonth- 
em hemisphere, from Orion to the Soutliern Cross, they are locally crowded together in a 
splendid zone in the direction of a great circle. But with the stsurs of the fifth and sixth 
to the tenth and fifteenth magnitudes (particularly therefore telescopic stars,) it ia veiy

To the naked eye the stars are distinguishable as to color at most as white, y^ow 
end red, and these not very distinctly marked. The telescope not only brings out these 
oi^ors, showing some stars white as Rilver, others yellow aa gold, and othm red as drops 
of blood ; bnt it shows also blue, green and violet starH, â€” stars in ftict trf all the colors 
of the solar epeetrom, and various intermediate shades. Occasionally more than a 100 
â–¼arious colored, red, g^cn, bine and bluieh green stars are so dosely thronged together, 
that they appear in a powerful telescope, to borrow the description of Sir John Herschel, 
**!ike a superb piece of fancy jewelry." Nor are these colors always constant. Sirios, 
the dog star, one of the brightest in the heavens, is uniformly described by the old as- 
tronomers as a fiery red star. It nciw shines with a perfectly white light. But unfor- 
tnitately we are not able to trace the steps by which this change took place, nor do we 
know the time at which it became marked. Many other stars are found by modem ob- 
servers to vary not only in color, bnt in brilliancy also. This however, is a less remarii- 
Able circumstance than the appearance and disappearance of new new stars, a phenom- 
enon of which wehavÂ« more or less certain instances from the time of Hipparchns down- 
ward, but which became specially conspicuous in the century from 1572 to 1670 ; no less 
than eight of these stars having made their appearance in this period. 

In the 180 years since, only one of these remarkable stars has been observed, although 
in this long interval, the heavens have been most carefially observed, and its stars, down 
to the ninth magnitude, eonnted and catalogued. On the 36th of April, 1843, at Mr. 
Kshop's private observatory in the Regent's Part, London, Mi. Hind, the discoverer of 
so many of the lesser [Janets, made the important discovery of a new reddish yellow 
star of the fifth magnitude in the constellation Opiunchus ; nor has the actual newness 
of the star, and the invariability of its position, (which proves it to belong to the region 
of the fixed stars,) been demonstrated in any other case with greater precision. In 1850 it 
bad dwindled to the eleventh magnitude, and has since disappeared. Such has been the 
Case with other stars of this class, though some of them have shone at their first ap~ 
pearance with a brilliancy equal to that of Jupiter and Venns, and have remained visi- 
Me, though with diminished brightness, for much longer periods, while others vanishing 
for a time, have again once or twice reappeared, and have finally, though with diminished 
magnitude, continued to maintain their place in the heavens. 



14 ASTRONOMICAL DISCOVBEQB& 

Another remarkable phenomenon revealed by thfe telescope, and which has heen of 
late a subject of careful observation, is that of doable or more ptopeAy of multiple stais; 
mapy, wMch to the naked eye, appear as a single star, being resolved by the telesoope 
into two or more, in close proximity. Within the last century, the search for stan U 
this character has been diligently prosecuted ; a single astronomer, the elder Strove, bav> 
ing examined for this purpose, not less than 120,000 of the fixed stars ; and the number 
known of these multiple stars has been raised from about 20, a hundred years badr, to 
about 6000 at the present time. But this- common desi^ation of multiple stavs in- 
cludes, it is to be observed, two sets of compound stars, m which the relation â‚¬)i the 
components to each other is totally diiferent Some stars are only double optically ; that 
is, they are seen in close proximity, not because they are in fact near each other com- 
pared with their distance from us, out merely because they happen to occupy the same 
fine of vision, in the same way that the moon is constantly appearing to touch and does 
actually eclipse certain fixed stars, though her distance from tnem is not mat^ally less 
than that of the earth, or h^ relations with them more intimate. Others again of these 
multiple stars â€” and this is the class the study of whioh is principally interesting â€” aie 
seen occupying the same field of vision, because, as compared to their distance from nsi 
their distance nrom each other is reduced to nothing. That such is the relation of two 
stars to each other may be proved not only by a change of place as to each other, but also 
(as has been ascertained as to a considerable number), by a perfectly uniform nxotion 
through space of which thev both partake. For it has been abundantly proved as to 
many of the fixed stars, and may be rationally conjectured as to all of them, that so fu 
from being actually fixedy they are moving, and it must be with vast rapidity, as other- 
wise at their immense distance from us, that motion could not be perceived exoepi in 
the lapse of a vast period. But this is a subject of which we shall speak more at m^i^ 
in a subsequent paragraph. 

Of the 6000 known stars which are seen multiple, 650 are already known as to -wfaidi 
a mutual change of position can be incontestibly proved, and in the case of from 14 to 
16, the orbit of their revolution round a common centre of gravity has been established 
with periods of rotation of from 30 to 632 years. One of tibese, the star in the constel- 
lation Hercules, designated by the letter z of the Greek Alphabet, and which has tte 
short period of 30 years, has twice completed its orbit since the epoch of its first dis* 
covery as a double star, and during this period has twice (1802 and 1831) presented the 
phenomenon of the apparent occmtation of one fixed star by another. In the case of 
the triple star in the constellation Libra, designated by the Greek x, as well as in that 
in the constellation of the Crab, desiffnated by the Greek z, the periodical movement of 
the two companions has been ascertamed with gi^at certainty. The latter system coo* 
sists of three stars of the third magnitude, differing very little in brightness, aad tlv 
nearer companion appears to have a motion ten times more rapid than the remoter one. 
In the case of the star in Orion, designated by the Greek thy we have a combination of six, 
in which the' five smaller stars, though no change has as yet been observed in their rek- 
tive position, yet follow the proper motion of tiie principal star. 

The discovery of the proper motion of the fixed stars was first rendered practicaUf 
when it became possible to compare with one another results separated by a long series 
of years, and when the telescope was combined with graduated instruments ; thus byde 
^es advancing observations of the place of the heavenly bodies, from the accuracy of with- 
tn a minute of an arc, (to which Tycho Brahe after infinite pains had first of all observcn 
succeeded in obtaining by the naked eye) to the accuracy of a second or the part of a 
second. Halley, from a comparison of the positions of three very noted stars, Siiios, 
Aieturus, and Aldebaran, as determined by Ptolemy in his revision of the catalogue of 
Hip|Â»archus, 1844 years before, with his own observations of them in 1717, conaideied 
himself justified in announcing the fact of a proper motion in those three stars. The 
x^mparisons begun by Halley were continued by Mayer (1756) and Maskelyne (1770), 
and the proper motion of the fixed stars was in some degree regarded as a general hd 
even in the middle of the last century. But for the more precise and numerical detenoi- 
cation of this class of phenomena, we are indebted to the great work of Sir William 
Herscbel, in 1783, founded upon the observations of Flamst^, and still more Bessdi

and Argelanden's snooeasful oomparison of Bradley's ^ Positions of the Stars for ITSS,'' 
witik recent cataloraes. 

The discovery of the proper motion of the fixed stars has proved of so mach the greater 
importance to physical astronomy, as it has led to aimowledge of the motion of our own 
solar system through the starryrealms of space, cmd indeed to an accurate knowledge of 
the direction of this motion. We should never have become acquainted with this fact, if 
tile proper progressive motion of the fixed stars were so small as to elude all our measure- 
ments. The zealous attempts to investigate this motion, both in its quantity and in its 
dirisction, and to determine the parallax of the fixed stars, and thereby their distances, of 
Which we shall presentiy speak, by leading to the improvement and perfection of arc 
graduation and of optical instruments in connection with micrometric appliances, have 
contributed more than anything else, especially by the ingenious employment of great 
meridian circles, refracting telescopes and heliometers, to raise the science of observation 
to the remarkable height of accuracy to which it has attained, especially since the year 1830* 

The quantity of the measured proper motions of the fixed stars, varies from the 20th 
part of a second, to almost eight seconds. The more luminous stars have, in general, a 
slower motion than those from the fifth to the sixth and seventh magnitudes ; yet some 
bright stars have revealed an unusually great motion, among which are Arcturus, of the 
first magnitude, and a bright star of the constellation Centaur, also of the first magnitude. 
The accumulation of then: proper annual motion during 2,000 years, has amounted re* 
spectively to two and a half^and three and a half diameters of the moon. Three others 
of tiiese swift-moving stars, one in Cassiopeia, of the sixth magnitude, a double-star in 
constellation Eridanus, of between the fifth and sixth magnitude, and another double-star 
in the constellation of the Swan, of about the same apparent size, have a proper motion suf- 
ficient to reach, by accumulation through 2,000 years, in the first and second cases to three 
and a half, and in the third, to six diameters of the moon ; while this same proper mo- 
tion, in the case of three other stars, of from the sixth to the seventh magnitude, would 
reach, for the same period, to from seven and a half to eight and a half moon's diameters. 
These, however, are extraordinary cases. The arithmetical mean of the several proper 
motions of the fixed stars, would scarcely exceed one twenty-second of that of Arcturus. 
Since these proper motions are from one-twentieth of a second to seven seconds and 
seven-tenths, and consequentiy differ, in the least, in the ratio of 1 : 154, the relative dis- 
tances of the fixed stars from each other, and the configuration of the constellations them- 
selves, cannot, in long periods, remain the same. The southern cross will not always shine 
in the heavens, exactiy in its present form ; for the four stars of which it consists, move, 
with unequal velocity, in different paths. How many thousand years will elapse before its 
total dissolution, cannot be calculated. In the relations of space and the duration of time, 
no absolute sense can be attached to the terms great and smoB. 

In all calculations as to the proper motions of the stars, as deduced from observatioui 
allowance is first to be made for the aberration of light, a phenomenon first discovered 
by Bradley, in 1727. We must then allow for the apparent motion of the stars, produced 
by the nutation of the earth's axis, (also discovered by Bradley ;) a consequence of the 
attractive force of the sun operating upon the protuberance about the earth's equator and 
causing a vibratory motion in the eartn, by means of which the earth's poles, instead of be- 
ing always directed to the same points in tiie heavens, describe there, in a little less than 19 
years, a small ellipse, of which the greater is to the lesser axis, as 37 : 27, the length of the 
greater axis, in arc of a great circle, being 18.6 sec. To the effect of the sun's attraction 
(to which that of the planet Venus is also to be added),, operating upon this same protu- 
bewÂ«ice, is to be ascribed a much more important apparent change in the observed places 
of the fixed stars, discovered as much as 2,000 years ago, by the celebrated Hipparchus. 
though the cause was first explained by Newton. By comparing his own observations of 
tile longitudes of the fixed stars, that is, their distances measured on the ecliptic, arid follow- 
inff the course of the sun from the vernal equinox (still called the first point of Aries, though 
it has long since ceased to fall within that constellation), with the longitudes of the same 
stars, determined by Timochasis and AristiUus 150 years before, Hipparchus found that his 
own observations differed constantiy in one direction, with an increase of distances, at the 
late of about one degree in a century. Justiy referring this relative change of position not to 



Id ASTRONOMICAL DISCOVERIEa 

the motions of the stars, but to a change in the position of the points of intersection of tlie 
ecliptic and the celestial equator ; and because in reference to the circle of the earth's dirnntl 
movement the equinoctial points were carried forward, Hipparchus named this phenoro^ 
nonthe Precession of the Equinoxes; though, as the equinoctial points retrograde ontte 
ecliptic, thereby causing an increase in the distance of all the stars from the first point 
of Aries, measured upon that circle, it might with at least equal propriety have heea 
Cfdled the Retrocession Of the Equinoxes. We may conceive of this phenomenon as pit), 
ducing, or as represented by, the slow revolution of the pole of the celestial equator round 
the pole of the ecliptic, a revolution proceeding, at present, at the rate of about 60J sec 
annually, and which it takes 25.800 years to accomplish. It is a consequence of this mo- 
tion that, to spectators on a given point of the earth's surface, the fixed stars altematdj 
advance and recede, to such an extent that the Southern Cross, which now only becomes 
visible in the northern hemisphere within 30 deg. of the equator, might, 5,000 ago, baye 
been plainly seen in the latitude of London and Berlin. 

Correction made for aberration of light, nutation, and precession of the equinoxes, 
what remains of the observed motion of the fixed stars requires still another correctioa 
for the effect of their parallax ; that is, the change in the angle under which they are seen 
fromxlifferent extremities of a diameter of the earth's orbit ; which parallax, could it be 
accurately ascertained, would give us the distances of the fixed stars, the rate and direction 
of the motion in space of our solar system, and the true proper motion of the fixed stars 
themselves, â€” three great, complicated, and difficult problems, so closely connected with 
each other, that their already partially-successful solution depends upon the same means, 
every improvement in the instruments and methods of observation and calculation which 
are employed for the furtherance of any one of them, being useful also in both the othen. 
So lobg as accuracy of observation did not exceed the minute of an arc, (the highest point 
attained previous to the employment of telescopic means,) no perceptible changes from 
parallax could be observed in the position of the fixed stars, fi'om which it was concluded 
that the distance from us of the nearest of them must exceed 3,438 times the distance of 
the earth from the sun. This limit rose to 206,265 distances of the earth from the stUt 
when certainty to a second of an arc was attained in the observations of the great as- 
tronomer James Bradley. But it was only in the brilliant period of Frauenhover's instm- 
ments, by which the direct measurement of an arc of the heavens might be accuratelj 
made to within about the tenth of a second, that the means began to be possessed of as- 
certaining the parallax of any of the fixed stars. In consequence of the widely diffused 
opinion that the superior brilliancy of a star must invariably indicate a greater proximitr^ 
stars of the first magnitude were, for a long time, selected for observation, with but little 
success. An accurate and satisfactory knowledge of the parallaxes of a few fixed stais, 
onlv dates from between the years 1832 and 183Â». 

Although Peters, in his valuable work of the distances of the fixed stars (1846), esti- 
mates the number of parallaxes hitherto discovered at thirty-three, there are only loi^ 
which merit a special, though very different degrees of confidence. 

The parallax of the star Alpha, in the constellation of the Centaur, the finest double- 
star of the northern henMsphere, and the third in brightness of all the stars, has been cal- 
culated at 0.9128 sec. by the observations of Henderson, at the Cape of Good Hope, in 
1832, and by those of McClear, in 1839, a result which would give a distance from us of 
225,735 semi-diameters of the earth's orbit, a space which it would take light aboutthiee 
years to traverse. Still more reliable is the determination of the parallax of the star 61 
of the Swan, the distance of which is found to be about three times as great as that of 
tiie preceding. The parallax of the polar star has been fixed, by Peters, from a compari- 
son of many observations, made between 1816 and 1838, at 0.106 sec ; which would gi^ 
a distance between three and four times as great as that of the above-mentioned star in 
the Swan. On the other hand, the observed parallax of Sirius and of the star Alpha ifl 
the constellation liyra, would show a, distance half as great as that of the Pole star. 
Sir William Herschel found, from the mean of eleven measurements conducted with 
a prismatic apparatus, that the full moon was 27,408 times brighter than the star Alpha 
of the Centaur. According to Wollaston, the light of the sun is 801,072 times that of the 
full moon. It seems, therefore, very probable, when we take into account the distance 



ASTRONOMICAL DI800VBBIES. ,17 

of the star in the Centaur as detennined by its parallax, that its real luminosity is two 
and three-tenths greater than that of oni son. W oUaston foand the brightness of Krios, 
the brightest of all the fixed stars, and, according to Sir William Herschel, equal in light 
to about 200 stars of the sixth magnitude, to be 20,000 million times less than that of the 

. 8tu}, which, however, wouM still give to Sinus, if we are correct as to its distance from us, 
an absolute intensity of light sbcty-thr^e times greater than that of the sun. 

It does not appear, firom the results hitherto obtained, that the brightest stars are near* 
^6t to us. The nearest of all, as far as yet known, the star in the Swan, is only of the 

. sixth magnitude, and of course but bardy visible to the naked eye. 

After carefully allowing for all that is due to the precession df the equinoxes, the nu- 

. tation of the earth's axis, the aberration of light, and the changes of parallax caused by 
the earth's revolution round the sun, the remaining annual motion of the fixed stars com- 

. prises at once that which is the consequence of the movement of the whole solar system 
through space, and that also which is the resulj of the actual proper motion of the fixed 
stars. Bradley, in his treatise on Nutation in the year 1748, first suggested the idea of a 
movement of the solar system through space, and the most desirable methods of observ- 
ing it Subsequently, the mere possibility and the greater or less probability of sudi a 
movement, were referred to in the writings of Tobias Meyer, Lamberii^. and Lalande ; 
but Sir William Herschel had the great merit of being the first to verify the ooDJecture 
by actual observations. He found, in 1783, 1805, and ISCNS, what has since been confirmed 
and more precisely determined by many later and more accurate inquiries, that our solar 
svstem moves towards a point near to the constellation of Hercules, in about Right ascen- 
sion (distance on the equator from the first point of Aries) 260 deg., and between 30 deg. 
and 34 deg. of north declination ^distance north of the celestial equator). 

4* NebtUae.^^ In connection with the general subject of the fixed stars, their distance, and 
the relations of our own solar system to them, great attention has been recently given to 
a class of bodies known as Nebulae, or stellar dusters, scattered through the heavens in 
various directions, and which may be well enough described as milky-ways on a small 
scale, â€” a smallness, however, not so much perhaps owing to any actual comparative 

. fimallness of size as to greater comparative distance from us. Of these bodies, Ptolemy's 
catalogue of the stars mentions six only ; and though others were discovered and noted, 
in the course of the intervening ages, especially the celebrated Magellanic Clouds near 
the southern pole, yet down to the time of Sir William Herschel, the number known was 
very limited. Including those noted in the catalogues which he published in 1786, 1789, 
and 1802, revised with additions by Sir John Herschel, the number was raised, in 1833, 
to 2,307. To these have since been added, by Sir John Herschel's explorations at the 
Cape of Grood Hope, and those of other observers in the southern hemisphere, about 1700 

.more. 

A small part of these nebulae, appearing to the naked eye or to glasses of small power, 
like little fragments of the milky-way, are completely resolvable, like parts of the milky- 
way itself, into distinct, separate stars, and the resolution of some remarkable nebulae 
which hitherto had resisted all telescopes (especially one in the constellation Andromeda, 
resolved by George Bond of the Observatory of Cambridge, Mass., into more than 1500 
distinct stars), has led, of late, to the opinion that aU nebulae are of this character, and 
not masses of unconsolidated vapor (like the trails of comets), the elements of systems 
of worlds not yet consolidated and organized, as had been previously conjectured. 

The prevailing idea at present is that these nebulae, appearing even to powerful tele- 
scopes only like shining spots in the heavens, constitute each its starry world, like that of 
the milky-way to which our own solar system belongs. No idea is more calculated to force 
upon the mind the conception of the boundlessness of the universe, since, according to an 
ingenious calculation of Sir John Herschel, the light of these distant bodies, faintly visible 
to our most powerful telescopes, must have required not less than 2,000 years to reach 
our earth. 

From the number of observatories now established in various parts of the world, the 
perfection of instruments, and the zeal and care with which observations are made and 
recorded, it may be reasonably expected that, in the process of years, some very consider- 
able additions will be made to our present knowledge of the vast realms of space, with

II ASTRONOMICAL CAUSE OF THE SEASONS, AND OF VAEIATI0N8 

IN THE LENGTH OF THE APPARENT DAY, 

Astronomers, in speaking of the motions of the heavenly bodies, have nnfortaoately 
adhered to the unscientific language derived from the apparent motions of those bodies^ 
"vv^oh are altogether different from their real motions. Thus they speak of the zodiac u 
the path of the sun ; they speak of the sun as crossing the equator, at the spring and an- 
tumnal equinoxes ; approaching the tropic of Ccmcer, at the summer solstice ; and the 
tropic of Capricorn, at the winter solstice. This method of speaking ia very apt to con* 
fuse the minds of those not familiar with the subject, and to prevent them from formiog 
dear and distinct ideas as to the actual causes of variations in the seasons and in tk 
length of the days. 

It must always be borne in mind that the sun is stationary, or so nearly so that tbe 
centre of the orbit in which it revolves is, at all times, included within its own circuinfer- 
ence. The actutd motion is on the part of the ecurth, whidi, in the course of the year, de- 
scribes a complete revolution about the sun. The zodiac, therefore, is in fact not the path 
of the sun, but the path of tbe earth ; and when astronomers speak of the sun being 
in a certain sign, the real fact is, that the earth is in the opposite sign. If the sun seem 
to move through the signs of the zodiac in a certain direction, it is because the earth is 
actually moving through those signs in the opposite durection. 

Observe, also, that ti^ough the twelve signs, or portions of 30 degrees, into which the 
Bodiac is divided, were named originally after certain constellations, with which, at that 
time, they corresponded, thb correspondency does not now exist There is a slightriiregQ- 
larity in the motion of the earth in its orbit, occasioned by the irregular figure of the earth, 
flattened at the poles and bulging out at the equator, which has given rise to what 
astronomers call the precession of me equinoxes^ in consequence of which, the two equiÂ« 
noxes and solstices do not occur at the same points of the earth's course round tbe 
sun as formerly, but have, by very slow degrees, been moved considerably forward. The 
point where the vernal equinox occurs is, however, always considered the commencement 
of the first degree of Aries ; and all the other signs are reckoned in order from that 
point, including thirty degrees each| without any regard to the actual position of the con- 
stellations whose names they bear. 

In order to form a clear idea of the actual causes of the variations in the length of the 
days and the consequent variety of seasons, we must recollect that the axis of the earth, 
about which it performs its daily revolution, thereb}^ producing the alternation of day and 
night, is not perpendicular to the plane of the earth's orbit, but inclined at an angle of 
23j deg. If the axis of the earth had been perpendicular to the plane of its orbit, the 
plane which divides the enlightened from the dark side of the earth, would always have 
passed through the two poles, and would have constantly revolved on the same axis with 
the earth itself. The consequence would have been that the days and nights, in all parts 
of the globe, would always, at all times of the year, have corresponded exactly to each 
other, being precisely twelve hours each ; and that, so far as concerns this matter, the 
motion of the earth in its orbit would have produced no result at all. This would have 
affected not only the length of the days, but the climate also. The degree of warmth pro- 
duced by the rays of the sun, depends upon the perpendicularity with which those rays 
fidl. Thus at noon, when the sun is high in the heavens, its rays produce a much greater 
warmth than early in the morning, or at night, when they fall in a very oblique or slajit- 
ing direction. In the case above supposed, the axis of the earth being perpendicnlar to 
the plane of its orbit, the rays of the sun, at noon, would always have fallen perpendicn- 
hriy at the equator, the sun then being directly over head ; while toward each of the poles, 
the noonday height of the sun would have gradually diminished, till at each pole it 
would have remained, during the whole twelve hours it was visible, just in the horizon, 
with a small apparent motion from east to west The consequence would have heen,

tliat at the equator, there would faaye been fclt a coastaat summerytnnidi like whati3 
experienced there at present This summer would gradually have passed off, on both 
sides of the equator, into two zones of moderate temperature, whioh would have been 
gpradusdly succeeded by two zones of perpetual winter. 

The inclined position of the earth's axis, has produced a very different distaribution of 
the sun's heat At the vernal equinox, when this inclination of the earth's axis is nei- 
ther from nor towards the sun, it produces no effect whatever, and the distribution of 
light and heat is for the moment precisely the same which it would have been all the 
year round, had the earth's axis been perpendicular to the pktue of its orbit Of course, 
at that moment the days and nights are equal throughout the ^be. The sun is vertical 
at the equator, and visible, just in the horizon at both poles, ^ut the moment the earth 
leaves that point of its orbit, and advances onward in its course, the north pole begins to 
lean constantly more and more towards the sun, and the south pole to be withdrawn 
more and more from it, till at the end of three months, at the summer solstice, there is 
round the north pole a space of 23^ deg., in which the sun is constantly visible, not set- 
ting at all, but appearing to describe a small circle in the southern quarter of the heavens. 

At this period the sun is vertical at noon, not at the equator, but at the tropic of Can- 
cer, and the heat of this vertical sun is experienced for a period of thirteen and a half 
hours. Of course a greater heat is then felt there, than is ever felt at the equator. The 
belt about the equator is not therefore, as many are apt to suppose, the part of the 
earth's surface at which the greatest heat is felt It is never so hot there as it is in the 
two belts on each side of it, in the vicinity ol the two tropics. Not only are the days 
longer than at the equator, during the period at which the sun is verticcal at the tropics, 
â€” but in the belt on either side of the two tropics, extending from 15 deg. to 25 deg. of 
latitude, the period at which the sun remains nearly vertical amounts to nearly three 
months annually, and during that protracted period cf a nearly vertical sun, a great de- 
gree of heat is produced; whereas at the equator, though the sun is vertical twice in the 
year, the motion of the earth in its orbit, alters so rapidly the vertical direction of the 
son's rays, that the equatorial belt of 24 degrees, including 12 degrees on each side of 
the equator, does not enjoy a sun nearly vertical for more than two months iu the 
twelve, and those two months separately, at intervals of half a year, or nearly so. 

If, however, the heat of the equatorial belt never rises to so high a point as that of 
the two tropical belts, it is more steady and uniform. 

The greater de^ee of heat in the tropical belts, will seirve to explain why all the great 
burning deserts of the earth, such as Sahara, the deserts of Arabia, Persia, India, and 
the interior provinces of Mexico, and in the southern hemisphere, the burning deserts of 
northern Australia, of Bolivia and Peru, are all found within the tropical belts-*â€” by 
which we understand belts on both sides the two tropics, each including eighteen de- 
grees of latitude, extending from 12 degrees to 30 degrees. 

The ancients, when they approached the tropic of Cancer, and found the great degree 
of heat prevailing there during the summer solstice, reasoning from analogy, that Hie 
nearer the equator was approached, the hotter it must grow, came to the hasty conclu- 
sion, that the equatorial regions must suffer from a burning heat unindurable by man. 
The facts above stated, serve to explain how it happens ti^at this conclusion was not 
correct. 

While the earth remains with the north pole pointed towards the sun, the rays of the 
sun fall more perpendicularly upon all the northern hemisphere, and continue to enlight- 
en it for more than half of the twenty-four hours, leaving less than half for the other 
hemisphere. This, in all the parts of the earth north of the equator, is the period of 
long days, and of summer. Within the tropics, the days do not exceed thirteen and a 
half hours in length, but beyond the tropics, as the summer sc^tice approaches, the days 
become longer and longer, though they do not exceed twenty-four hours till the Arctic 
circle is passed. From the Arctic circle to the pole, the length of ihe day varies rapidly 
from twenty-four hours, to six months. Of course we here mean by a day, not the pe- 
riod of the revolution of the earth on its axis, which must be uniform in all parts of the 
earth, but the apparent day, the period during which the sun remains above the h<Â»rizon. 

Though at all times, in those parts of the earth greatly removed from the equatoTi tbÂ» 



90 CAUSE OF THE SEASONS. 

rays of the sun fall very obliquely, yet the length of the day makes up, to a great ex- 
tent, for the obliquity of the rays; so that even within the polar circle, duriiig that 
part of the year in which the sun remains constantly above the horizon, a great degree 
of heat is, mr the time, attained. But this does not last long. The earth passing on k 
its orbit begins gradually to withdraw its north pole from the sun, tiU at the end of three 
months more, the autumnal equinox occurs, at which period the earth is again situated, 
with respect to the sun, precisely as it was at the vernal equinox, only on the opposite 
side of.it; and the days and nights are again equal throughout the globe. Passing on 
in its orbit, the earth now begins to turn its north pole more and more from the sun. The 
pole itself is enveloped in a perpetual night, which lasts for six months, and this night 
gradually descends towards the equator, till at the end of three months more, at the win* 
ter solstice, it overspreads a circle of 23^ deg. of latitude from the pole as a centre. Along 
with this night comes a terrible winter, the cold increasing more and more the longer the 
sun is withdrawn. Meanwhile in those parts of the northern hemisphere, not within 
the polar circle, the days grow shorter ana shorter, till at the winter solstice, they be- 
come shortest. At the same time the ravs of the sun fall more and more obliquely, 
and of course afford less and less heat This period of the earth's circuit round the sun 
is thus, in the northern hemisphere, the period of short days and of winter. 

It is obvious that the position of the southern hemisphere is exactly the reverse of 
the northern. The south pole is now turned towards the sun, and all the results pro- 
duced under similar circumstances, in the northern hemisphere, now occur in the south- 
em. The winter in the northerik. hemisphere is the period of summer for the south- 
em hemisphere. What we call, from its effect upon us, the winter solstice, is to them 
the summer solstice. But the earth stops not; still it moves on in its orbit, and ap- 
proaches again to the point from which it started. The south pole now begins to be 
withdraT^m from the sun. During the next three months, the days in the southern hem- 
isphere shorten, and the perpendicularity of the sun's rays diminishes ; while in the 
northern hemisphere, the days lengthen again and the heat of the sun becomes moK 
powerfuL At the end of twelve months from the commencement of the revolution, the 
vemal equinox is again reached, and the variations in the length of the days and in the 
position of the earm with respect to the sun's rays, are completed. The year is finished, 
again to begin, and to repeat unceasingly the same course of revolutions. 

Two things, however, require to be specially noticed. One is, that the periods of 
greatest heat and greatest cold, do not correspond exactly with the periods of longest and 
shortest days, but occur, &;enerally, about a month later. It requires some time for the 
accumulated heat to proouce its greatest effect ; and on the other hand, the heat stored 
up in the earth's surmce during summer, is not entirely dissipated, till some time after 
theperiod of shortest days is passed. 

The other thing to be noticed is, that although the heat and cold of places depend 
primarily upon their astronomical position on the globe, that is upon the time for which 
they enjoy the rays of the sun, ana the approach of those rays towards perpendicularity, 
yet that the effects thence resulting are greatiy modified by several causes, of which the 
most important are : 1st, winds, by which the cold air of the colder regions, rushes in 
towards those which are heated ; its place being supplied by the warm air from those 
heated regions ; 2d, currents in the ocean by which the heated water is transferred to- 
wsurds the poles, and the cold water towards the equator; these two causes constant!/ 
tending to produce equality of temperature ; 3d, difference of elevation, isolated pointe 
raised high in the air, parting with their heat with great rapidity, not replacing it by the 
reflected or radiated heat of surrounding objects, and being greatly exposed to the coU 
winds ; and 4th, the relative position of any given portion of land or water, with i^nrdto 
other portions of land and water, capable of exercising an influence on its cwnate. 
These subjects, so important towards a correct idea of climate and its causes, will be 
considered in a subsequent article. [See Article 6th.] 

The orbit of the eartji is not a perfect circle, but an dUipse. The consequence is, that 
the portion of its orbit tzaversed from the. vemal to the autumnal equinox, is somewhat 
longer than the portion traversed from l^e autumnal to the vemal equinox. It thus btppenB 
thad the summer of the northern hemisph^fe is a little longer than the sommer of the

Bcmtheni hemisphere. It results however from this same irregularity, that the earth dur- 
ing our northern winter, is at its greatest distance from the sun, whereas during the south- 
ern winter, it is at its least distance. The difference in the quantity of heat, thus occa- 
sioned, is however very trifling. 

ni FIGURE OF THE EARTH. MAPS AND CHARTS. LATITUDE AND 

LONGITUDE. 

1. Figure of the Earth. It was long supposed that the figure of the Earth was that of a 
perfect sphere ; and when this was shown not to.be the case, it was still supposed that 
it must be a regular figure, the degrees of latitude yicreasing or diminishing in uniform 
proportion. But according to the most recent measurements, this is not the case. The 
earth is not a precise geometrical figure. It is so far flattened at the poles and so bulges 
out at the equator, that it is fourteen miles further from the equator to the centre of the 
earth, than it is from the poles to the centre. 

It results from this that the power of gravity is not so great at the equator as it is at 
the poles, and the intermediate points. A pendulum which beats seconds in our latitude, 
requires to be somewhat shorter in order to beat seconds at the equator. It also results 
that the degrees of latitude are not precisely of the same length, but that they diminish 
towards the poles. This diff*erence, however, is not great ; though upon maps drawn upon 
a very large scale it requires to be attended to. 

2. Maps and Charts. It is only by means of lines of latitude and longitude (which 
mean simply breadth and length) that we are able to determine the relative position of 
places on the earth, and so to delineate globes, maps and charts. By these means also 
the traveller through unknown regions, or the mariner traversing pathless seas, is able to 
determine, day after day, his precise place on the earth's surface, and to direct his course 
accordingly. It is by means of a great number of astronomical observations nfade in all 
parts of the earth, that the maps we possess have been brought to their present perfeo* 
tion ; and jt is principally by means of more exact observations constantly made, that 
these delineations are from time to time rendered more correct 

It must always be borne in mind, however, that our maps are for the most part, only 
approximations towards correctness. In some parts of Europe, especially in England 
and France, exact trigonometrical surveys have been made, and the topography of those 
countries has been laid down with mathematical exactness. A similar survey has been 
bad of the State of Massachusetts ; one is now in progress under the auspices of the 
Federal government of the sea-coast of the United States. But for large parts of the 
globe, the materials we possess for map-making, are far less to be relied upon. Only 
a few principal points have been determined with exactness. The outtines which we 
poBsess of Asia, Africa and America are tolerably correct;â€” but a large part of the in- 
terior of those countries is delineated from very insuflBcient information, and may strictly 
speaking, be said to be quite unknown ; and this is true to a still greater extent of 
Australia. Even the outline of several of the great Oriental islands, is yet unascertained. 
The same is the case with the northern coasts of Greenland, and America. 

3. Methods of ascertaining Latitude and Longitude. The methods of ascertaining 
the latitude and longitude, are among the great boons which astronomy has conferred 
upon geography ; and such is the perfection to which the instruments and tables de- 
signed to assist in these calculations have been brought, that they may now be easily 
practised by any one. The term longitude or length is applied to distance east or west, 
because that is reckoned through half the circle; distance from the equator, being 
reckoned only through a quadrant, is called latitude or breadth. 

The latitude is ascertained by observing, with a quadrant, the meridian altitudfe of the 
heavenly bodies. That point of the heavens towards which the north pole points, called 
the celestisd north pole, will always have an apparent elevation or depression, corres- 
ponding to the position of the observer upon the earth's surface. If the spectator is at 
the north pole of the earth, the celestial north pole will be directly over his head, that is, 
it will be elevated 90 degrees above the horizon ; if the spectator is at the equator, the 
celestial north pole will be just in the horizon, withoiit any elevation whatever. 9ot 



22 CAUSES OF THE SEASONS. 

every degree that he advances from the equator towards the north, the celestial north pole 
will be elevated one degree above the horizon. If, on the other hand, he goes south, the 
celestial north pole, for every degree that he goes, will be depressed one degree below tbe 
horizon. It is plain, then, that if we can ascertain, at any place, the distance of otur ze- 
nith from tiie celestisLl north pole, and thence the elevation or depression of that pole above 
or below onr )iorizon, we shall know exactly our distance from the equator, in degrees of 
latitude, and whether that distance is north or south. Now tables have been carefuUy 
calculated, showing the position of the sun each day in the year, with respect to the ce- 
lestial equator, and of course its position with respect to the celestial north pole ; so ^at 
by observing the apparent altitude of tbe sun at noon, we are able from that observation 
to calculate the elevation or depression as respects the place of observation of the celes- 
tial north pole, and thence to determine the latitude. Similar tables have been calcnlated 
as to several of tbe brightest fixed stars.. 

The determination of the longitude of a place as compared with some other place,â€” 
that is, the distance apart of those two places, measured on the equator, depends npoD 
tho faot that as the entire revolution of the earth on its axis is completed in twenty-four 
hoursy therefore in every hour the earth revolves through a distance of fifteen degrees of 
longitude, or one degree in four minutes. Thence it follows, as the motion of the earth is 
from west to east, that for every degree we go westward, the apparent time as shown by 
the sun and stars, becomes slower by four minutes ; and for every degree we go east- 
ward, the apparent time becomes faster bv four minutes : that is, the sun and the fixed 
stars nse ana set sooner by four minutes for every degree we go eastward, and later by 
fbur minutes for evÂ«ry degree we go westward. If therefore we observe an eclipse, or 
^y other phenomenon, which takes place for all parts of the world, at the same absolnte 
period of time, and if we know the apparent time iait which this phenomenon takes place 
at Greenwich for instance^ bv companog our observed time with this known time, the 
differenoe of time, allowing four mmutes of time for one degree of longitude, will show 
our longitude from Greenwich, which will be east longitude if the time at the place of 
observation be earlier than it is at Greenwich, or west longitude if that time fee later. It 
10 upon this principle that longitudes are calculated, not only from eclipses of the sun 
and moon, both of which methods axe liable to some uncertainty in practice, and which 
gaa only be employed a few times in the year, but from tbe eclipses of the satellites of 
Jiipiter, which are constantly occurring ; gr according to the method commonly used at 
sea, by what are called funar observations^ that is, measuring with a sextantthe angular 
distance of the moon from the sun, or from some particular fixed star, noticing the exact 
time of the measurement^ and then by means of tables, which show what the time was at 
Gree&wich, or some other place for which the tables are calculated, when the same angle 
WHS seen there, ascertaining the difference of time between our observation of a particn- 
kr ajigle and the occurrence of that sam^ angle at Greenwich, or some other fixed point 
from which longitude is reckoned. Knowing the difierence of time, of course we know 
tile difierence of longitude. Another, much simpler and more expeditious method of as- 
certaining the longitude, has come lately into use. This consists in having a chronome- 
ter, &t time-ke^er, regulated to keep exact time, and set to Greenwich time, or to the 
time of any other place from which it is proposed to reckon the longitude. This chro- 
nometer tlie traveller or mariner carries with him, and when he wishes to know his Ion- 
l^ude, he makes an observation of the altitude of the sun at the same moment that an- 
other person observes and notes the time by the chronometer. From the observed altitude 
of tbe sun, knowing the laktude, he calculates the apparent time at the place of observap 
tion, and comparing that time with the time of the chronometer, he thence determines his 
longitude* This method would be perfect, if chronometers could be rendered perfect ; and 
Ihe very great improvements which have of late years been made in the construction of 
those instruments, has caused them to come into almost universal use at sea. 

l%ere is no fixed point from which longitude is reckoned, as latitude is from the equator. 
Some meridibm is assumed as the first Thus the English reckon from Greenwich, near 
London, where the Boyal Observatory is ; and the French, from Paris. The Americans 
tOfifetiiEkes reckon from Washington. It is desirable that some first meridian should be 
assumed by the common consent of civilized nations, and that all should alike reckon 
from that

IV. CONTINENTa ISLANDS. TIDES. SALTNESS, COLOR, AND PHOS- 
PHORESCENCE OP THE SEA- 

1. Cantmentg. â€” All calculations as to the relative eictent of land and water, and the 
sizes of the different continents and islands, are to be received with some alloxvanoes. 
The extent of Ghreenland stiU remains miknown, and it is as yet undetermined how far 
the American, continent extends to the north, and what islands lie beyond li 

There are also strong reasoira for believing in the existence of a vast Antarctic oontl* 
nent, occupying a great extent about the south pole. Land has been discovered, at nume* 
rons different points, in about the latitude of the Antarctic cimles, by various navigators. 
The recent French and American Exploring expeditions sailed, for a ffteot distance, along 
what seemed to be the shore of a frozen southern continent, though the icy, inclement^ 
and precipitous coast prevented them from landing. This coast lav to the south of New 
Holland, in the latituae of the Antarctic circle, or about 66 deg. of south latitude. It is 
not easy to explain upon any other theory except that of a frozen Antarctic continent^ 
Hbe great degree of cold which prevails in high southern latitudes, far exceeding that of 
the corresponding northern latitudes. IS there were an open sea all south of the known 
continents, the high southern latitudes ought to be warmer than the corresponding north* 
em latitudes. 

Islands. â€” The number of islands, in the whole, is very great; they are of every siae^ 
from a mere speck or bare rock just elevated above the water, to those capable of furnish* 
ing a home for great nations, and even to the two great Eastern and Western continentB, 
which are only islands on a great scale. It is observed of islands, that they enjoy a more 
equable temperature than continents, from tiie circumstance that the water with which 
they are surrounded is not so good a radiator of heat as the land. To the same droum* 
stance is to be ascribed the land and sea breezes, the sea-breeze blowing during the morn* 
ing, and the land-breeze during the ni^t, which also tend to preserve an equality of teni* 
perature in islands. The more extended sea-coast which islands enjoy, is also a great 
advantage in several ways. The salt which the air brings with it, is a great fertilizer ; 
and to this, as well as the moisture from the same source, is to be ascribed the peculiarly 
verdant appearance which many islands present The facilities and excitements to navi> 
gation which islands offer, cause islanders in general to be sailors, and even those, such 
as the islanders of the Pacific ocean, who have made but trifling advances in civiliiation, 
have attained to more skill in navigation than in anything else. 

Though islands are to be found scattered here and there through all the oceans, it is to 
be observed, in general, that they are much fewer in the Atlantic than in the Pacific and 
Indian oceans. The seas, bays and inlets frt>m the Atlantic, such as Hudson and Bofr 
fin's bay, the Gulf of St Lawrence, the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean sea, and on the 
other coast the North sea, the Baltic, and the Mediterranean, contain indeed a large numbet 
of islands ; and many of those in the European seas especially, have played a very con^ 
spicuous part in the history of mankind. But in the main, open Atlantic, the number Is 
very small. North of the equator we find only the groups of the Azoresj the BermudaSy 
Madeira^ the Canaries^ and the Cape de Verds, South of the equator they are stiH fewer: 
Ascension Island and St. Helena^ occupied by the English, mere single islets of volcanio 
rocks, but of some importance, as affording stopping places to vessels bound to India, 
and the Falkland group, far to the south, also lately occupied by the English, are the 
principal. 

In that vast tract of ocean stretching from the eastern coast of Asia and Africa to ttie 
western coast of America, we find as it were an island world, to which the general title 
of Oceanica has been given. Besides Australia or New Holland, the size of which hat 
obtained for it the title of the third or southern continent, we have islands and groups of 
islands, endless almost in number, many of them small and uninhabitable, but others of 
very great size and capable of accommodatinff an immense population ; some of them, 
indeed, are already populous ; but as this portion of the world is as yet very imperfectly 
known, we cannot speak with any certainty as to the amount of their population. Be- 
ginning with Madagascar on the coast of Africa, large enough to be a great khiigteBi 



M CONTINBNTB AND ISLANDS. 

and having a large population, we notice Bourbon and MimrittuSy two small iskwds of 
about 600 square miles each, in the Indian ocean, which having been colonized bj En* 
ropeans and planted with coffee and sugar, have obtained on that account, an impo^ 
tance disproportionate to their size. Socotra near the entrance to the Red Sea, is fi- 
mous for its aloes ; Ceylon^ 20,000 square miles in extent, with a population of a nil- 
lion, celebrated for its cinnamon, and into whi6h the cultivation of conee has been moR 
recently introduced, is now possessed by the English. The Javan Group, or fianda 
Islands, besides the great islands of Java^ Sumatra^ Borneo and Celebes^ inclodes a Taal 
rtiaiw others, and among them many of great size and fertility. Java is possessed bj 
the Dutch, and of late years through the extended cultivation of sugar and coffee, has 
risen rapidly in commercial importance. The Dutch are also gradually extending tbek 
conquests over the principal islands of the group. East of Celebes lies the famous 
group of the Moluccas or Spice IslandSj where alone originally grew the clove and the 
nutmeg. Gilolo is the largest of these ; Temaie and TidorCj though very much smaller, 
are more celebrated in history and poetry. The Dutch have forts and factories bore. 
Still farther west, is Papua or New Guinea, a vast island very little known, with nianj 
other large islands belonging to the same group. Further west and south are the two great 
islands of New Zealand^ now beginning to be colonized by the English ; and off Hie 
southern extremity of New Holland is jiismania or Van Diema/n?s Landj also an English 
colony. To the north of Borneo, lies the group of the PhilippineSy including hesida 
MmcUmao and Luzonj several other large islands. The Spaniards possess a part of Ln- 
zon, â€” the others are independent. North of the Philippines, is Formosa^ a Chinese isl- 
and; and further north the celebrated group of the Japan Islands, the seat of a num^oos 
and remarkable nation, of which, however, we know very little. To the eastward of 
these groups of great islands, and between them and the American continent, lay scattered 
far and wide, a multitude of clusters of smaller islands, and uninhabited Islets, known by 
the general name of Polynesia. The extension of the whale fishery and of commerce, has 
of late yeâ‚¬u*s made us familiar with many of these groups, especially the Sandvnch ^ 
andsy the Society Islands and the Marquesas^ lately taken possession of by the French, 
the Naviffotors islands and Friendly islands. Imssionaries and merchants are daily 
poshing their way more and more among these groups. They are becoming better 
known, and the natives are acquiring the arts, and it is to be feared, too many of the 
vices of civilized life. PUcaim^s island derives an interest from the origin of its inhabi- 
tants, and the Pelew and Loo Choo islands from the full and interesting accounts whid 
we possess of the natives. But this is a subject to be more fully treated under the head 
of Oceamca^ 

3. Tides. As water is a substance so mobile, its particles are more easily drawn from 
their places than those of the earth, by the powers of gravity and inertia. Hence the 
ooean is raised up in a broad ridge or ring in that portion of it which is most directly ex- 
posed to the attraction of the sun and moon, and also upon the opposite side, where 
the earth is, as it were, drawn away from the water. As the moon, though so much 
smaller than the sun, is so much nearer the earth, and as the force of gravity diminishes 
with the square of the distance, the moon plays a much greater part in .the phenomenoa 
of tides than the sun. We may conceive two great tidal waves compassing the 
earth like broad rings; one caused by the attraction of the sun, and the other and much 
larger one, by the attraction of the moon ; the earth passing under each of these rings 
twice every 34 hours. Once a month the sun and moon are in conjunction, that is, they 
both attract in the same direction ; it thus happens that these two tidal rings coalesce, and 
thus are produced those monthly high tides called springs. Once a month the sun and 
moon are in opposition, they then attract in opposite directions, and the tidal rings tend to 
counterbalance and destroy each other ; hence result those monthly low tides, called neapt> 
The intermediate tides are high or low, in proportion as the time of springs or neaps ap- 
proaches. The lunar tides conform to the rismg of the moon, by following each other abont 
60 minutes later every day. The solar tides take place at the same hour every day, but 
their effect only becomes perceptible in their tendency, according as they combine or op- 
pose, to increase or diminish the height of the lunar tides. 

In giving this theory of the tides, we have supposed, for the sake of simplifyiog our 



TIDES. SS 

-view, the earth to be one uniform sheet of water. It iÂ» evident that the great maaees of 
the contaneot stretching from north to Bontb, most greatly interrupt the motion of the ti- 
dal rings, and modify taeir result It is to be observed tnat the effects of the tidal rin^ 
in raising the level of the water is not perceptible in tiie broad ocean, whue there it 
nothing to interrupt the gradual onward motion of the tidal wave. It is only when that 
â– wave encounters the obstacle, not of some petty island, but of a broad reach of land, 
that the water is piled up as it were in a wall, and being thus accumulated, tumbled 
upon the shore. Hence the shape and position of the land have a great effect upon the 
hei^t of the tides. 

Where the water of the tidal wave is ponied into a funnel shaped aperture, like the 
bay of Fundy, and the wide mouthed rivers on the west coast of England and Scotland, 
it sometimes rises to a very great height. The interruptions of the tidal wave by 
intervening lands, give rise to cuneuts, which themselves again greatly affect the tides. 
They are also much operated upon by winds, especially on shallow coasts. 

4. SaUness of the Sea. It is now pretty generally agreed that the saltness of the 
sea is produced by the salts contained in the earth, and which are dissolved in the mn- 
ning water and canied into the sea. The constant evaporation going on upon the aor- 
face of the ocean, takes up only the water, and leaves the salts behind. As this evap- 
oration ia much greater under the equator than about the poles, and aa the tropical rains 
must supply the rivers emptying into those seaa with a large proportion of salts washed 
from the earth's surface, we can easily understand why the saJtnesa of the sea is greater 
at the equator than in the polar regions, where not only ia the evaporation less, but tiie 
supply cooeists chiefly of melted snow and ice, containing but little if any salt. 

5, Color and Phosphorescence of the Sea. The usual color which sea-water exbibite 
is a bluish green, of various shades. Some maintain, that this is its true and proper color ; 
others, that it is an optical illusion, occasioned by the greater refrangibility of the blue 
taya of light, â€” opinions which may both be true to a certain extent. The ocean seems 
often to assume varioua other colors ; some of them no doubt real, but aa oftÂ»n illusory.' 
Among the more general sources of deception, may be reckoned the aspect of the sky; 
thus an apparently dark-colored sea is a common prognostic of an approaching storm ; 
not that the water then is really blacker than usual, but the dark color of the clouds in- 
distinctly seen in or reflected from the waves, is mistaken for the color of the aea itself. 

The variety of colors in the sea may probably arise from animal and vegetable mat- 
ters difliised through the waters in a putrescent state, and communicating various tints. 
The yellow and bright green shades aeem to be owing to living marine vegetables, which 
grow at the bottom, streteh their fibres through the water, or spread over the surface. 

The phosphorescence of the sea is acommon but very remarkable phenomenon, concern- 
ing the cause of which authors are not agreed. But most probably, as Newton conjeo- 
tared, it proceeds from a variety of causes. It has been aficribed to luminous animals 
and to the phosphorescence of semiputre- 
scent matter diffused through the ocean. 
It is well known, that various fishes and 
other marine animals, emit light, which 
does not in every instance appear to be 
voluntary, or to depend on the vital prin- 
ciple, as, in some of them, it continues, 
and perhaps increases, after death ; but 
\ motion seems to be either a principal 
cause, or at least an exciting one ; iot 
this light more rarely occurs, and ia macb 
fainter, in still water, whilst it becomes 
more and more brilliant as the motion 
increases. It is also more abundant im^' 
mediately before and during storms. It

SURFACE OP THE LAND. 



V. SURFACE OP THE LAND. MORAL EFFECTS OF ITS CONFIG. 
URATION. 

That the confignration of the eurfaoe of the earth must produce a great effect upon 
the i^anta and animals that inhabit it, and upon man not less than upon the rest, is a 
fact, the importance of which towards a correct view of the hiatoty, position and proe- 
pects of the human race, is only now beginning to be nnderstood. 

Taking the level surface of the ocean aa a common commencement or basis of 
reference, it ia an obvious fact, that the dry portions of all the continents, rise more or 
leas, though very irregularly, above the surface, bo that we can acarcely conceive of the 
existence of large regions in the interior of the continents of Asia for example, vhidi 
are surrounded by mountains, and depressed below the general level of the ocean. Facts 
of this kind do however exist, though indeed only as remarkable exceptions. Compara- 
tively few cases are well aacertained, such as that of the valley of the Jordan and the 
Dead Sea, which lies from 700 to 1300 feet below the level of the Mediterranean; a 
they escape our attention, because these depressions are generally filled with the waiera rf 
inland seas or of large lakes. Such is the case with tne Caspian Sea, of which the 
depth is unknown, but whose surface is some forty feet lower than that of the ocean. 
Thus also with the great fresh water lakes of north America, the bottoms of which are 
ftom 300 to 400 feet below the level of the sea. The bottom of lake Maggiore, at tbe 
southern foot of the central Alps, in Italy, ia likewise nearly 2000 feet lower than fbe 
surface of the Adriatic. 

The rise of the continent* from the shores of the ocean is very irregular. Sometimes 
it is so gradual, as in the plains through which flow tbe Amazon and the Missisuf^i, 
that the eye is unable to perceive it, and we infer its existence only from the flowing of 
the river. To ascertain it positively we must resort to the instruments of the engineer, 
which will indicate a rise of only a few inches in a mile. Elsewhere the masses of land 
rise at once to the elevation of several thousand feet, as in Mexico, and form high pla- 
teaus, more or less uneven in their surfaces. Here steep mountain chains shoot Itoih 
the coast, as in Peru, and send their summits into the region of the clouds. There de^ 
valleys separate the various ridges, or cut them through transversely as in those fearfol 

chasms of the Andes, known u 
guetrados, or sometimes, as is 
Oregon and the great plains at 
the eastern foot of the Bock/ 
Mountains, trace furrows onetH' 
two thousand feet deep in the 
solid unbroken mass of the pla- 
â–  teans. Yet notwithstanding 
the vast variety of ways in 
which the surfoce of every conn- 
f try is moulded and its relieb 
composed, they may all be le- 
feired to two great classes, eaA 
divisible into two well marked 
' : varieties, viz: 1. The elevation 

in one mass of large sarfacu, 
and 2. The elevation ia a rela- 
tively narrow line. BletatiMi 
of urge surfaces aie called 
plains, or low-lands, when they are level, and but little raised above the ocean. Th^ 
are called plateaus or table-lands when they present a vast onlKoken mass, wiia 
one elevated summit Â«â–  platform, the surface of which, whether level, rugged or moan- 
tunons, is still at a considerable height above the sea. Elevations in a relatively IIB^ 
BOW line form the various chains of mountains, and those at a single point, detached 
mountains. 



SURFACa OP THE LAND. Â» 

These four fonns of low plains, hi^ pkdns or plateaus, mountain ebains and detach- 
ed mountains, combine with each other in the most diversified manner ; though gener- 
ally the plateaus are associated with the mountains, which seems natural, as both are the 
Feralt of the most powerful upheaving forces. â€¢ It is the peculiar mode in which Ifaese 
forms are combined, which gives to each continent and tract of land its characteristic sur> 
Ikce and profile. Of how ^at importance this characteristic of a country is, much as it 
has been overlooked till within a quite recent period, will appear frona a few considem- 
tions. A little observation will satisfy us that vast as is the mass of the globe, and of that 
coating of atmosphere by which it is surrounded, organic Ufe exists only on the earth's 
surface. There, where the ocean, the atmosphere, and the dry land meet, at the contact of 
these three great combinations, reacting upon each other in a thousand ways, and aided by 
the beneficent influence of the heat and light of the sun ; there, and there only, vegetation 
springs up, and animal life comes into existence. But the range of this regipn of life is 
very nmited. As we depart from the level of the sea, whether ascending into the heights 
of the atmosphere, or descending into the depths of the ocean, we find that heat and aU 
the conditions of a strong physical life, gradually diminish, and we soon reach the cold 
and barren dominions of physical death. Even in the most favored pcurts of the tropical 
regions, at a height of from 15,000 to 17,000 feet, and much lower in other zones, vege- 
tation, after having lost, at every stage of its ascent, some portion of its vigor and luxu- 
riance, ceases entirely, and a uniform coating of perpetual snow and ice destroys its faint- 
est traces, and stifles the last breath of life. At the elevation of the highest peaks of the 
Andes or of the Himalaya, from 25,000 to 28,000 feet, the atmosphere loses two-thirds of 
its weight, and the cola and rarefied air is unfit to sustain the life of organized beings. 
At the depth of a few thousand feet, or even of a few hundred feet, the absence of light, 
the low temperature, and the excessive pressure, convert the ocean into a desert ad unin- 
habitable as the lonely summits of the mountains. A layer, of about five miles thick, is 
the only portion of the globe in which organized life is possible. Even under the most 
fieivorable circumstances, three miles is the height of the vertical zone in which vegetation 
exists, and in which man and animals can form a permanent abode ; while two miles 
and a half is the utmost limit within which agriculture can be carried on and extensive 
human societies can exist. 

The scale of altitude by which we pass from the hottest and richest to the coldest and 
poorest countries, from life to death, being thus so short, it is very easy to perceive the 
immense influence which the relative elevation of a country or place above the level of 
the sea must exert upon its climate and its whole nature. An elevation of from 300 to 350 
feet, which is not equal to the height of many structures reared by the hand of man, is 
si^cient to lower the mean temperature of a place one degree of Farenheif s thermome- 
ter, thus producing the same eflect as if it were removed one degree further north at the 
original level. On the slopes of the Andes, at an elevation of 2,000 feet, the hot region, 
with^ the true tropical cultivation, ceases. At 6,000 feet, the tropical forms of plants dis- 
appear, and we behold a vegetation which brings to mind that of the warmer regions of 
the temperate zone. Higher still, at 8,000 feet, the cereal grains remind us of the colder 
temperate regions ; while at 12,000 feet, the naked wastes of the Paramos, carry \is to 
the arctic regions ; which, in the temperate zones, may be arrived at by half that ele- 
vation or less. We must always recollect, however, that there are great dmerences in the 
effect of the same elevation, even under the same latitude, in the cases of an isolated 
mountain top, of wide-spread plateaus, and especially of elevated valleys surrounded by 
mountains ; differences produced by the rapid radiation of heat in the one case, and the 
compensating effects of reflection in the others. 

The extent of the difference of elevation, compared to that of the mass of the earth, is 
very smaU. On a globe of twenty feet diameter, an elevation of less than a sixth of an 
inch would represent the highest mountain. Yet these differences produce moral and po- 
litical results not less remarkable than those of a physical kind. Thus, for instance, 
mountainous countries enjoy not only the advantage of abundant rains, pure water and 
afr, and accessibility of the mineral productions of the earth, but what has been and is 
of great importance, defensibility agamst the inroads of enemies. They have the disad- 
vantages of a less fertile 8oil| and dimouliy of communication. 



aÂ» SPBINO& 

I^vel plains present great advantages for locomotion ; but they axe opt, especially if 
interior and elevated^ to saifer from want of sufficient rain, from the stagnation of suck 
as does fall, producing pestiferous marshes, by which the air is poisoned ; and though 
often,* especially in the vallevs of great rivers, they present tracts of surprising ferti%, 
they are very difficult to deifend, and easily fall a prey to an invading enemy. 

While in mountainous countries there is a tendency in the people to form them^Yes 
into small, independent clans, in great plains there is a tendency towards the {amkSM 
of vast monarchies, â€” any one tribe which, by accidental circumstances, has att^^t 
superiority, easily succeeding in conquering ail its neighbors, one after another, Hadj|BiB^ 
bining them into a vast empire. 

It seems probable that the fertile banks of rivers, like those of the Euphrates, tlu&IQr^ 
and the Granges, by the abundant supplv of the necessities of life which they aflbri^ 
may have been the earliest seats of civilization ; but those countries, by reason of ftdc 
indefensibility, have been easily overrun and subdued by barbarian conquerors, in whose 
hands the progress of civilization has soon coihe to a stop. It is in mountainous countries, 
like Greece and Italy, which enabled the inhabitants to offer a successful resistance to in- 
vaders, that civilization has been carried onward ; and it is this peculiarity in its face, 
which has contributed not a little to make Europe the seat of modern civilization. 

The same cause may be traced in its operation upon neighboring and sister countries. 
Thus the great difference in the political and social position of Scotland and Ireland, may 

Eerhaps chiefly have arisen from the fact that Scotland, from its mountainous characteTf 
as been enabled to offer a successful resistance to every invader, or soon to shake off the 
yoke ; while Ireland, destitute of mountains, except on its extreme western coast, has 
been easily overrun and subdued, and is easily kept in subjection. It is by general 
views like these, and which might easily be extended to a great length, that Physical 
Geography may be made to shed a strong and valuable light upon the political and sodal 
history of the human race.

VL SPRINGS. ARTESIAN WELLS. GLACIERS. AVALANCHES. RIVER& 

1. Springs. â€” The apparent layers, of which the crust of the earth is composed, are 
generally to be found not in a perfectly horizontal position, but more or less mclined to 
the horizon. These layers ^o are cut by great valleys, usually the beds of streams, so that 
their edges crop otUj as it is called. It is upon these declivities, where one layer orops 
out from beneath another, that springs are usually found. The different layers, of which 
the crust of the earth is composed, have a very different power of retaining or transmit- 
ting water. There are some, such as sand and travel, through which the water freely 
1>enetrates ; and others, such as clay and rocks of various descriptions, which are abso- 
utely impervious to it. Thus in digging wells, water is generally found whenever the 
bed of sand or gravel is penetrated, and a hard bed of clay or rock is approached* If, 
however, the clay or rock lies upon the surface, it must be penetrated before water can 
be found. 

All the rain that falls tends constantly, by the force of gravity, to seek the lowest level 
Such as cannot run off from the surface, evaporates ; or, if the earth on which it falls is of 
a penetrable description, sinks through it. It continues to permeate till it arrives at some 
layer impenetrable to water. As these layers, for the most part, are arranged in a more or 
less oblique position, when the water can no longer sink m a perpendicular direction, it 
soaks downward along the declivity of. the permeable layer, till at last that layer crops 
out in some valley, or the bed of some river or lake. Here the water bursts forth in the 
form of a spring. In this way, a portion of the rain water sinks graduallv to great depths, 
and passing through various media, becomes much impregnated with them, before it 
makes its appearance again at the surface. Hence the various mineral springs. The hot 
springs are supposed to derive their warmth from the internal heat of the earth, a subject 
to wMch we shall again presently refer. As rivers always run at the lowest levels ot tie 
country through which they pass, and generally flow in deep valleys, we can understand 
how they will be perpetually fed by springs, independent of the tributaries which they 
receive. 



AETESIAN WELLS. GLACIEES. 29 

"Where the water permeatBa 
toa great distance before itfinda 
its discharge, it frequently col- 
lects in great streams, and bursts 
forth from the earth ahnost a 
navigable river. There are seve- 
I ral such remarkable river-heads 

! in Florida. In many cases, the 

I springs find their discharge on- 

ly below the surface of the sea. 
j There are several cases known, 

in which fresh water thus bub- 
bles up in the ocean, in great 
quantities, even out of sight of 
land. The fresh water tends 
strongly to rise to the surface 
because it ia lighter than salt 
water. 
GtjMa, or Bot-Springi of IccUml. 

2. Artesian Wells.^Jn some countries, where the surface-layer of the soil is of a kind 
very permeable to water, such as sand, and this layer extends to a great depth ; or where 
the surface-layer is impregnated by salt, or lime, or some other substance which makes 
the water nnnt for use, bnd is immediately succeeded by a thick layer of clay, lime, or 
something else which contains no water at all ; and especially if the surface is very level, 
great difficulty has been experienced in obtaining a supply of good water. In such coun- 
tries, the springs are rare and the spring-watet bad, while the ordinary method of dig- 
ging wells is hopeless. This has given rise to a practice of boring for water, whereby a 
hole is drilled or bored through the superincumbent strata containing bad water or none 
at all, and the drill is carried down till it reaches some layer containing good water. This 
water must have originally fallen upon the surface, at a greater or less distance from the 
bore, and must gradually have soaked through the layer containing it, till it has reached 
the place where that layer is penetrated by the auger. But according to a well known 
principle of hydrostatics, water carried through a tube or other channel which confines it, 
will ^ways rise in that tube or channel to a level with its original source. Hence the 
water rises through the bore of the auger often to a level with the surface ; and, in some 
cases, when it has been derived from a high source, it spouts out with great violence, 
and rioes to a level far above the surface. 

Wells thus made are called Artesian wells, because they were first used in Artois in 
France. One had lately been completed at Paris, after years of labor, on a very large 
scale. It is the deepest in the world. It penetrates, for nearly half a mile, the bed of 
gypsum (plaster of Paris) upon which that cifv is built; and the water, which is quite 
warm, rises up with great force, near a hundrea feet above the surface. These wells are 
now in common use in almost all parts of the world, and have proved of great utility. 
It ha3 even been proposed to try the experiment in the desert of Sahara, for the purpose 
of supplying the caravans ; ana, very likely, the French will do it. 

3. Glaciers. â€” Though tJie glaciers that descend from the heights of the Alps, down 
the valleys of those mountains, have all the appearance of being solid bodies of ice; yet 
it is well ascertained that they have, in summer, a slow, progressive, downward motion. 
As they are thus perpetually moving forward, they would presently fill up and overwhelm 
the cultivated valleys beneath, were they not constantly melting at their lower ends, and 
passing off, as running streams of water. Mcmy attempts have been made to account for 
and explain the downward motion of these glaciers, but without much success, till it has 
lately been suggested that though composed externally of solid ice, they consist internally 
of consolidated snow, more or less permeated by water. In the heats of summer, as this 
water is increased in quantity, the whole internal body of the glacier acquires a semi- 
liquid character, and slowly moves down the valley by ihe effects of gravity. 



Â» AVALANCHBa RIVERa CUMATR 

4 Avakmehes, â€” i- VaBt masses of snow and ice, called ayalandbes, are sometimes, in Hat 
beats of summer, broken off from the body of th^ glaciers, and, tumbling headlong down 
the sides of the mountains, have swept everything before them. It has repeaiedlT inp. 
pened in Switzerland, that whole villages have been overwhelmed by these masses of sdov 
and ice. In some particular cases, some of the unfortunate inhabitants, though thus booed 
alive, have, by the bursting of the mass, enjoyed an accession of firesh air, and have tes 
been able to preserve their Uves for weeJcs, till they w^e disinterred by tiieir netghboe. 

5. Rivers. â€” The length of the rivers, given in the table contained in me body of the wA 
must be taken as approximate only. Msmy of the pincipal rivers mentioaed in it have never 
been surveyed at all ; and, in all accounts of the length of rivers, must vary gieatlj irith 
the extent to which, in estimating that length, the sinuosities aj*e followed. 

But the length of rivers is but a very uncertain test of their relative importance. Dot 
depends very much more upon the quantity of water which they discharge, and satirfK- 
toiy means of measuring this are not ofi)on v^ attainable. 

The number of rivers in the Eastern continent has been estimftted at abofatfour hmidni 
and thirty J and in the Western continent at about one hundred and forlifj c(Â»intingasse|>> 
arate rivers not all the little streams which flow into the larger ones, but only such as bare 
a separate discharge into some ocean, sea, or inland lake or its branches, and of notie^ 
able size. The rivers of the Western continent, though fewer in number, discharge how- 
ever immense volumes of water, quite unparalleled in the Eastern continent. 

Some portions of the globe suffer greatly from an insufficiency of rivers. America is 
very well watered, and so is Europe and parts of Asia ; but Africa is very deficient is 
rivers, and Australia labors under the same difficulty. 

Many of the larger rivers are of great utility for purposes of navigation, thougb iti! 
only by the very recent invention of steamboats that their utility in this respect has been 
fully developed. Even the smaller streams, not capable of bein^ navigat^ themselves, 
have, by modern science, been converted into feeders to canals, which are artifidal rivere, 
much better adapted than natural ones 'to the purposes of navigation. But the still more 
modem invention of railroads, from the superior rapidity of conveyance, and their incfc- 
pendence of the seasons, threateiji to supersede both rivers and canals. 

6. Declivity of Rivers. â€” Avery slight declivity will suffice to give the running motion to 
water. Three inches per mile, m a smooth, straight channel, gives a veloci^ of abont 
^ee miles an hour. The Ganges, which gathers the waters of the Himalaya monntaiDs, 
the loftiest in the world, is, at eighteen hundred miles from its mouth, only eight hno- 
dred feet above the level of the sea ; and, to fall these eight hundred feet the water lequirK 
in its long course, more than a month. The great river Magdalena, in South America. 
running for a thousand miles between two ridges of the Andes, falls only five handretl 
feet in all that distance. Above the commencement of the thousand miles, it is seen de- 
scending in rapids and cataracts firom the mountains. The gigantic Rio de la Plata \m 
so gentle a descent to the ocean, that in Faraway, fiifteen hundred miles frt>m its mouth. 
ships are seen which have sailed against the current, all the way, by the force of the wind 
alone ; that is to say, which in the beautifully inclined plane of the stream, have been 
gradually lifted by the soft wind, and even against the current, to an elevation of a thoQ- 
sand feet 

VIL CLIMATE. WINDS AND RAINa 

1. Characteristics of Climate. â€” The three great elements of climate are the tempoa- 
ture, the winds, and the rains. If we know the amount and the distribution of these 
three elements throughout the year, especially of the first and last, we may fairly say that 
we know what the cUmate of a place is. The distribution and character of the wiud^is 
chiefly of importance as it modifies the amount and distribution of the temperataie and 
the rains. Heat and water are equally necessary to vegetable and animal life, fleat with- 
out water is death, as we see in the burning deserts of Sahara and Atacama. Wata with- 
out heat is death also, as is proved by the bare and frozen plains of Siberia and Ai^^ 
America, where vast sheets of fresh water cover great spaces, and immense and poweiml 
streams, among the largest in the world, flow uselessly through a frozen soil, which thej 
are unable to fertilize. 



ZONBa OF CLiMATEL 



Mad) beat and nuidi water dothe the earth wUik that tluak and abundiuat vegetatioa, 
whose richness and gorgeonsness we so much admire in the regions near the equator. 
Muoh heat and litlie water produce the scanty, conoenlTated and aromatio plants of hot 
and dry countries. A diminished degree of heati and a diatribution of rain throughout 
the whole year, moderate in its total quantity, give rise to the more sober and yet dk- 
tittotly marked vegetation of temperate climates ; whUe the diminished heat of northern 
regions allows nothing to grow but bushes, gmsses, and finally, mosses and lichens. But 
it IS tiie distribution of heat and moisture not less than their total annual amount, on 
which climate essentially depends. Two {^oes may have the same meâ‚¬tn annual tem- 
perature, and the same annual quantity of rain, and yet have no resemblance in their 
Eroductions. Climates diÂ£kr much m<Â»e in their range, their variation from greatest 
eat to greatest cold, than they do in their mean annual temperature. So it is with 
rains ; it makes all the difference in the world whether the same amount of falling mois- 
ture be all concentrated within a few weeks, or be distributed more or less over the 
whole year ; whether the rains be limited to the winter, when they are no immediate aid 
to vegetation, or whether they extend ovex the summer also. Thus at Yakutz in Siberia^ 
with a mean temperature of only 13i deg., yet as the summer, though venr short, is hot 
with a mean temperature of 62, bEurley may be cultivated on ground which a ^w feet b^low 
ibe surfieu^e remains permanently frozen, while on the Paramos or highest plains of the An- 
des, though the mean temperature is muoh above the freezing point, yet for want of summer 
beat, nothing fit for human food will grow. And thus it happens that those parts of the 
United States which enjoy the same annual mean temperatiue with the countries of 
southern Europe in which flourish the olive and the orange, are yet {M^vented by the 
frosty character of their winters, or at least by their liability at that season to be sudden- 
ly cooled down by northerly winds to the freezing point, and even far below it, 
nom producing those plants to which frost is fatal ; the great heat of their summers mak- 
ing up for this excessive winter cold, and bringing back the annual mean to a deceptive 
equality with that of southern Europe. Hence' with about the same mean temperature 
of 51 deg. of Farenheit, New York and liondon have very diflerent climates ; that of 
New York being bright and sunny, with rapid changes ; in winter, ice, snow, and good 
sleighing, with a mean below the freezing point, and in summer great heats, with a mean 
above seventy ; that of London being foggy and cloudy, having a mild and moist win- 
ter, with green fields and a temperature of 40 deg., while the warm summer heat of 
only 63 hardly sufiSces to ripen the most common fruits, the violent extremes and sud- 
den changes of New York being unknown, the thermometer rarely falling below 14 deg., 
or rising above 70 d^. 

2, Zones of Climate. â€” Geographers, guided merely by astronomical considerations, 
have divided the earth into one Torrid zone, including all that portion over which, in the 
conrse of the year, the sun is vertical ; two Frigid zones, including that space about 
either pole, in which, in the course of the year the sun becomes invisible for twenty-four 
hours or longer ; and two Temperate zones, included between the torrid and the two 
frigid zones. 

Ck)nsidered as adapted to furnish an idea of the varieties of climate, this division is 
very defective. "With that object in view, the following division seems much to be pre- 
ferred to it: 

Isi The Equatorial zonej including twdve degrees on both sides of the equator. 
This is the zone of equitable temperature, the thermometer, except in those parts of it 
greatly elevated above the sea, being liable to only a very limited range, and in general 
not averaging above 80 deg. of Farenheit The seasons in this zone are only two, the 
dry and the rainy, except in some parts of it, where, in tiie course of the year, there are 
two dry sectsonS) and two rainy seasons. Within this zone, during the dry season, there 
will sometimes occur three or four months together, in which scarcely a drop oif rain 
will fall, yet this is made up for, by long and abudHant rains during the wet season. On 
the whc^e, this zone nmy be considered to enjoy an ample sufficiency of rain, and in 
coasequence, the vegetation is very rapid and supearabundant, and the earth for the moat 
ptrt is covered by tjiick, and almost impenetrable forests. The torrid zone is oonmionly 
spoken of as liable to hurricanes and terrible storms^ yet so frur aa relates to the equato> 



/ fisl zone now under consideration, this is wholly incorrect ^^^ittnn this zone hnrricanes 

â€¢ aie never heard of, and such things as long and violent storms are wholly unknown. 

The nearest approaches to them are thunder gusts and sudden squalls, which are of ray 

limited duration. Ships within these latitudes have very little to fear ; they even gwH 

erally ride at anchor on the open shore, without the necessity of seeking a harbor. 

Over this zone, the trade wind, a steadv, constant breeze, ranging from north-east to 
south-eaat, blows the whole year, except that for about three months out of the twdrc, 
during the hottest part of the year, each part in succession of the entire zone is liable to 
calms, during which the trade wind intermitp. North of this region of calms, wherever 
they may happen to fall, the trade wind blows from the north-east, and south of it^ from 
the south-east The regularity of the trade wind, for causes which will presently be as- 
signed, is also greatly disturbed on the coast of Africa, and in the Indian ocean. 

This equatorial zone includes, of land and water, about fifty-eight millions of sqnare 
miles, or considerably more than a fourth part of the surface of the globe. Not more 
than a seventh or eighth part of this is land, but that land embraces vast and prolific 
regions, of which as yet we know little. All the northern portion of South America is 
contained in it, including the valley of the Oronoco, and of the still vaster Amazons. It 
is this part of the equatorial zone with which we are best acquainted. It includes abo 
the central portion of Africa, the valley of the Niger, and those vast and probably pop 
lous interned regions south of the great desert, of which geography is not yet able to give 
any account Further east, it includes the Malayan peninsula, the southern extremitj 
of Asia, and the great islands of Borneo, Sumatra, Java, Ceylon, Celebes, Papua or New 
Guinea, Mindanao and the southern portion of the Philippine Group, the Mdlnccas, 
the Solomon Island, and numerous others, large, populous, and fruitful, of which we 
know hardly the names, and nothing else. 

This equatorial zone is far the most productive portion of the earth. It is the natifc 
region of the banana, the yam, the manioc, the pepper, the cinnamon, the clove, the cof- 
fee tree, and sugar cane, and of a vast variety of rich fruits and valuable vegetables as 
yet little known. The constant heat and the want of variety in the climate, tends to pro- 
duce a weakening and enervating effect ; yet, notwithstanding the opinion of some phi- 
losophers to the contrary, it is evident that these equatorial regions, {Possessed now for the 
most part by savage or barbarous inhabitants, must one day become the seats of great 
civilized communities. 

2d & 3d. Two Tropical zones^ extend, one on the north, the other on the sonth siife 
of the equatorial zone, as far as thirty degrees from the equator, each of them thus in- 
cluding eighteen degrees of latitude. Tlfese two zones each contain twenty-five mil- 
lions of square miles or both together, fifty millions, about a quarter of the earth's surface. 
These may be denominated the zones of three seasons^ viz., the cold, the hot, and the 
rainy. In that part of this zone which is nearest the equator, the rainy season is the 
longest, and extends with some intermissions, over nearly four months ; but as we de- 
part from the equator, the rainy season grows shorter, and at length over a considerable 
part of these zones, it fails almost entirely. Such parts indeed as are so fortunate as to 
have high mountains in their immediate vicinity, are blessed with frequent showers; bat 
far the greater portions of these zones suffer immensely from want of water, and dnrmg 
the hot season, the heat attains a degree hardly endurable. The cause of this great heat 
has been already explained in a former article, and the fact of the vast deserts foiuid 
within these zones, has there been adverted to. These deserts however are not so much 
owing to the extreme heat, as to the deficiency of min, either absolute as to quantity, Â« 
if the quantity be considerable then, by its all falling within a short portion of tteyear, 
leaving the earth during the rest of it to be burned up by a scorching sun. 

These zones, too, are the regions of those terrible storms, which under the Americaa 
name of hurricanes and the Chinese name typhoons^ are the terror of the mariner. "With 
respect to these remai^able storms, i^ to be observed, that they are most frequent ami 
destructive in that half of these zones which is nearest the equator, and that they ap- 
pear generally to take their rise where the land and water are interspersed, as in the (V 
ribbean sea, among the West India Islands, in the Chinese sea, and in the Indian OeeM 
in the neighborhood of Madagascar. They move firom east to west, and are geDÂ«raIIf 
limited, as to their extreme violence, to a narrow tract 



ZONES OP CLIMATE, 33 

The northern tropioal zone included the Weet Indies, Central America, and Mexico, 
with the peninsula of Florida, the northern portion of Africa, Arabia, the southern half 
of Persia, Chin-India, and the southern half of China. The southern tropical zone in- 
cludes Peru, Bolivia, Buenos Ayres, and the southern part of Brazil, South Africa, and 
all the northern part of Australia. In all tiiese countries, as in the corresponding northern 
zone, irrigation is necessarily resorted to, in order to carry on cultivation, and vast tracts 
are totally uninhabitable, for want of water. This deficiency of rain no doubt arises from 
general causes, closely connected with the pevailing winds ; but these causes have not 
yet been sufficiently investigated, and indeed hare hardly attsraeted the attention of phi- 
losophers. 

Over these two zones, especially in the part of them nearest the equator, the trade- 
winds prevail during a considerable portion of the year. They are liable, however, to be 
interrupted during winter by heavy gales from the poles, and, in the autumnal months, 
by calms and hurricanes. In the northern zone, July, August, September, and October 
are esteemed the hurricane-months ; in the southern zone, January^ February, March and 
April. 

4th and 5th. Two Temperate Zones^ as for wemt of a better name, we may call them, 
succeed the two tropical zones, and embrace the regions on both sides of the equator, 
between 30 deg. and 50 deg. of latitude. These zones contain, each, about 24,000,000 
of square miles, or together 48,000,000, a little less than a quarter of the earth's surface. 

They may also be. called Zones of Four Seasons, since it is only in these regions that 
the distinctions of Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter are fidly recognized. They are 
remarkable too, above all other sections of the earth, for frequent and perpetual variations 
of temperature, and might, on this account, be called Zones of Varinble Climate. 

These zones have a vegetation totally distinct from that of the three already described. 
In those, the plants continue to grow all the year, except so far as they may receive a 
check during the continuance of the dry season ; in these, vegetation is regularly checked 
by the recurrence of frost. 

These zones, with the exception of some interior elevated plains, in which the sum- 
mer rains fail, enjoy a succession of showers, distributed throughout the whole year, â€” a 
circumstance very favorable to the growth of cultivated plants ; though the bulk of the 
rain, either as rain, or under the form of snow, falls during the winter. The winds are 
very variable, though there is observed a general predominancy of westerly winds through- 
out the year, changing, in the ncHrthem zone, to north-west, north, and north-east during 
the winter ; and to south-west and south, during summer. In the southern zone, 
these changes are, in the winter, to the south-west, south, and south-east ; and, in the 
summer, to north, and north-west. In both zones, the tendency of the winds during win- 
ter, is from the poles; and during summer, from the equator. During the autumn and 
winter, these motions of the winds are much more violent than at other times. Terrible 
storms prevail at these seasons, which last for several days, beginning with the wind from 
the direction of the nearest pole, and travelling all round the compass, generally attended 
with much rain or snow, and spreading over a great extent of countiy. These storms 
are first felt in the part of their limit nearest the equator, whence they move in a curved 
path, towards the poles. The spring and summer are comparatively calm ; and, in propor- 
tion to the calmness or windiness of the winter, it is warm or cold. 

In the range of twenty degrees, which these zones embrace, there is, of course, a great 
variety of climate. The winter, as we proceed toward the poles, grows longer, at the ex- 
pense of the spring and autumn, and much more severe ; the summer is shortened, but, 
while it lasts, it has a degree of heat almost equal to that of the tropics. Towards the 
northern extremity of this zone, the distinction of spring and autumn almost disappears, 
the seasons dividing themselves into nine or ten months of winter and two or three of 
summer. 

The northern of these two zones embraces Canada, the United States of America, Ore- 
gon, and the Northern provinces of Mexico ; and, on the old continent, the countries bor- 
dering on the Mediterranean, including the northern coast of Africa and southern and 
central Europe, Asia Minor, northern Persia, northern India, northern China, Thibet, 
Tartary, and Japan. It is in this zone that man has made the greatest advances, and 

PART I. 5

tiiat almost all the great events recorded in the world's history, have occurred. The soudb 
ern of these zones is, comparatively speaking, very limited, and historically new and no- 
important It includes Chili, the southern half of Buenos Ayres, Patagonia, the reiy 
southern extremity of Afirica, known as the Cape Colonv, the southern and almost the 
#nly habitable portion of New Holland, and the islands of Van Dieman's Land and New 
Zealand. All these regions. Chili excepted, within the last fifty years, have been coloniz^ 
to a greater or less extent, by the English. 

With respect to the southern of these two zones, it is to be observed, that the half of it 
nearest the pole is far colder than the corresponding half of the northern zone ; and with 
respect to the northern afone itself, a very great difference is to be observed between that 
portion of it lying upon the western sides of the two continents, and that portion lying 
on their eastern sides. Hence the eastern and western shores of the Pacific and Atlantic, 
so far as they are included in this zone, enjoy verv different climates ; that of the two 
eastern and of the two western shores, corresponoing to each other ; and this difference 
extends half way or more across the continents. Thus the climates of Canada and the 
United States on tBe one hand, and of Tartary, northern China, Thibet, and northen 
Persia on the other, have a strong resemblance, being subject to very violent and sudden 
changes, and in winter to very severe degrees of cold. On the opposite sides of the con- 
tinents, Oregon and Upper California correspond, in climate, to southern and central Eu- 
rope, Asia Minor and the adjacent countries, and the northern coast of Africa ; the 
winter, in all these regions, being much more mild, comparatively free from frost and 
snow, and far less subject to sudden and severe occurrences of cold. The reasons of this 
difference will more distinctly appear when we come to speak of winds. 

6th and 7th. Lastly, we have two Polar Zones^ or rather circles, embracing all the space 
about either pole, as low down as fifty degrees of latitude. These are, again, zones of 
two climates, the winter lasting nine or ten months, and the summer two or three, with 
the remarkable exception presently to be noted. The prevalent winds in these zones are 
from the westward, liable to variations very similar to those which prevail in the inter- 
mediate zones ; but the nearer the poles are approached, the less there seems to be of at- 
mospherical disturbance. 

Of these two zones, the southern includes a few barren islands, and the as yet nna- 
plored coast of what is supposed to be a southern continent The northern zone includes 
the northern section of America, Greenland, Iceland, Spitsbergen, and Nova Zembh, 
northern Europe, and northern Asia. All these vast tracts, with the single exception of 
northern Europe, are hardly capable of cultivation, the ground remaining frozen during 
the greater part of the year. The eastern section of northern Europe, including tiie Brit- 
ish isles, enjoys a mild and equable temperature, neither the heats of summer nor the coM 
of winter touching an extreme point As we proceed westward to Holland, Denmaric, 
Norway and Sweden, northern Germany and Russia, the cold and length of the winters 
constantly increase ; but these countries remain capable of cultivation to a certain extent, 
almost or quite as far north as the Arctic circle. In the other parts of this zone, the case, 
as we have stated, is altogether different It is a frozen, uninhabitable region. The rea- 
sons of the peculiar advantages enjoyed by northern Europe, will appear in what we are 
going to say about winds. 

6. Winds and Rains. â€” The quantity of rain that falls in any place, is very greatly de- 
pendent upon the winds that blow over it To make this apparent, it is neces'sary to state 
a few simple and well ascertained facts. The air is capable of dissolving and taking up a 
certain portion of water, and this process, called evaporation, is always going on, in all 
parts of the globe. The moisture that falls, in the form of rain and snow, is thus again 
elevated into the atmosphere, to be again precipitated, and so on, in endless succession. 
The hotter the air is, or the more rarefied it is, the greater quantity of water it is capable 
of taking up. This water is so thoroughly dissolved in the air, that though existing in j^ 
to a ffreat amount, it is wholly imperceptible to the senses. When the nil feels moist, it 
has already begun to part with its water, which thus becomes apparent to the tonch and 
eye, in the form of mist, vapor, and at length of rain. Air, at any given temperature, is 
only capable of containing a certain quantity of water ; and if it be saturated with wa* 
ter, or nearly so, and its temperature be suddenly diminished, it must give up a certain 



WINDS AND BAINa 25 

portion of its water, which now becomes sensible to the touch or dght, or both. Thus 
the sudden cooling of the sur, at the setting of the san, causes dew to be formed, or, in 
winter, frost If two equal portions of air, of different temperatures, each saturated with 
water, are mixed together, the compound is no longer capable of holding in solution all 
the water before contained in the separate portions of air, and a mist or rain is necessa- 
rily focmed. Mist or rain can always be formed from air, by cooling it down to a cer- 
tain point That point, to which it is necessary to cool down any given portion of air to 
make it deposit moisture, is called its dew paint. 

It is necessary further to bear in mind, that the air is an elastic fluid, which expands 
rapidly with heat, and thus becomes lighter and tends to rise. It also expands, becomes 
lighter and tends to rise, by the removal of the superincumbent pressure of the weight 
of the air above it The expansion of the air is attended with a rapid loss of tempera- 
ture, the heat being absorbed and becoming latent Its condensation as it were squeezes 
out the heat, and makes it sensible, and the same is the case with the moisture it con- 
tains. The atmosphere also always tends to preserve an equilibrium ; that is, the least 
approach in any place towards a vacuum, causes all the circumjacent air to press in to 
supply the deficiency, the rush being greatest firom that quarter where the air is most dense. 
With these preliminary observations, let us now proceed to give a sketch of the causes 
and laws of winds and rains. 

The sun at the vernal equinox, is vertical at the equator ; by an apparent northern 
motion, in the course of three months it becomes vertical at the tropic of Cancer, then 
turns, and in another three months appears to move back to the equator. During these 
six months the region of greatest heat is the belt extending from the equator to the trop- 
ic of Cancer ; and the region of greatest heat in any given month is that parallel of 
latitude over which the sun a few weeks before had been vertical, â€” for it takes some 
time for the effect of the suit's vertical rays to be fully felt In the other six months the 
region of greatest heat is transferred to the other side' of the equator. Thus during the 
whole year, there is a certain portion of the Torrid zone which is hottest, and this por- 
tion twice in the year is in the vicinity of the equator. The air over this belt, which may 
be considered to include several degrees of latitude, being heated more than any other 
air, tends in consequence to rise, and does rise, thus producing a rarefaction of the air 
over that belt To supply the partial vacuum thus created, the air rushes in, both from 
the north and south. These currents meeting at the belt of greatest heat, counteract 
each other, and produce there a calm ; but both north and south of this zone of calms, 
the motion of the two currents is strongly felt, and kept up throughout the whole year, 
thus producing those constant, steady tropical trade winds, of which we have already 
spoken. It may be asked, how does it happen that the trades blow from the eastward 
and not, on the one side, from the north, and, on the other, from the south. To answer 
this question, we must heoi in mind, that the rapidity of the motion of any part of the 
earth's surface, is constantly accelerated as we approach the equator. A given point at 
the equator, moves through a thousand miles an hour ; this rapidity of motion constantly 
diminishes towards the poles, where it amounts to nothing. K a body of air remain 
stationary over any given portion of the earth's surface, it presently acquires the same 
rotatory momentum with that surface. If now this portion of air be suddenly removed 
to the south, it will not at once acquire the additional rotatory momentum which pre- 
vails there, and in the mean time, objects on the earth's surface dashing against it, this 
air will appear to have a motion contrary to that of the earth, that is, a motion from the 
east towards the west If on the other hand, this same portion of air were suddenly 
transferred northward, it would for a time, retain the excessive rotatory motion which it 
brought with it, and would consequently move over the surface from west to east. 

But when two motions are combined, one from the north and another from the east, 
there results from the combination, a north-east motion, more north or more east, accord- 
ing as the northern or eastern motion is more rapid. 

Thus, every movement of the atmosphere north of the equator which appears to us 
to come from the south-west, comes actually from the south, and every motion of the 
atmosphere which appears to us to come from the north-east, comes actually from the 



m WINDS AND RAINa 

north. South of the equator, every apparent south-east wind comes really from fk 
south, and every apparent n(Â»rth-west wind, really firom the north. 

Thus we see how it is, that the cool air rushing firom the direction of either pole, to 
supply the great vacuum constantly being produced "^thin the tropics, appears north of 
the equator, as a north-east wind veering, as the northern motion diminishes, to the east; 
while south of the equator it appears a south-east wind, veering, as the southeriy jnotioi 
diminishes, also to the east 

When it happens, owing to the greater accumulation of heat north of the equator bj 
reason of the greater mass of land there, that the south-east trades cross the equator as 
they do in the Atlantic and Indian oceans, the deficiency of westerly motion which thej 
bring with them, diminishes as they move northward, and from south-easterly they change 
into southerly winds, and even sometimes to south-west winds. 

As land becomes much more heated by the rays of the sun than deep water, and ai 
the direction of surface winds is governed a good deal by the character of that surface, the 
trades often vary a gcynl deal firom their regular course, in the vicinity of lands. Thus on the 
west coast of Africa, calms prevail, the rarefication of the atmosphere over that continent 
causing the air to move westward and northward firom the Atlantic ; thus exactly coun- 
teracting the trades. On the east coast of Africa, in the Red sea, the Arabian gulf, the 
bay of Bengal and the China sea, occur what are called the monsoons ; the wind daring 
half the year blowing from the north-east, and during the other half from the south-west 
Owing to the position of Asia with respect to the equator, the point there of greatest 
heat and rarefication is carried much further north than in the Pacific ocean ; the south- 
east trade is thus carried far north of the equator, and moving toward the north pole, it 
necessarily becomes, for the reason already pointed out, a south-west wind. 

While the atmosphere is thus moving firom the direction of the poles towards thf 
equator, the two vacuums exterior to the tropics, which thus tend to be produced, are 
filled up in summer mainly by the settling down of the equatorial air, cooled and 
rarefied by the height to which it has risen, and moving off to the north and south, 
(whither it is impelled by the laws of equilibrium towards the supply of the deficiencies 
there existing,) and as it settles towards the earth developing from the increased pressure 
to which it is subjected both heat and moisture. The trade winds are only a surface 
current ; above them, as tbe motion of the clouds show, there is a constant rush of the 
air towards the poles ; and there can be little doubt that in the mutual action of these 
two currents upon each other, the true explanation of the tropical rains will be found. 

For the reason already stated, when a gap occurs beyond the trades, which admits 
it to drop down to the surface, this upper current of atmosphere flowing from the tropics, 
appears in the northern hemisphere, as a warm, moist south-west wind, or when it loses 
its polar motion, and has parted with its excess of heat and moisture, simply as a dry, 
clear west wind, which by the pressure upon it of a northern current, may become also 
a north-west wind; and hence it is that the changes of our winds are from south-weÂ«t to 
west, north-west, north and north-east, with storms, clouds and rain, which dcnot dis- 
appear till the northern current is effectually stopped, a result indicated by a change 
of wind from the east by the south to south-west and west ; any change to the west 
by the north, being most likely a temporary fluctuation not to be depended upon. 

It is not however solely firom this equatorial source, that the supply of atmosphere to 
the temperate zones is kept up. The cold and condensed atmosphere of the polar re- 
gions, struggles also to contribute its share. As the progress of the winter renders the 
polar atmosphere colder and more condensed, it rushes towards the tropics, at irr^lar 
intervals, with greater and greater force, under-shooting, as it were, the equatorial supply, 
and compelling it to move further and further north. These sudden jets of polar atmos- 

f)here, rushing with fury towards the tropics, create on either side of them, according to the 
aw of the motion of fluids, two eddies or counter currents firom the opposite direction. We 
may thus understand how it happens that at a place which feels the full sweep of one 
of these polar blasts, the thermometer will sink very low, while at the very same time, 
another place, at no very great distance, and under the same latitude, will enjoy a tropi- 
cal breeze, and very moderate weather. These polar gales rushing furiously towards djc 



WINDS AND RAINS- 37 

tropics, themseiyes distnrb the eqnilibrinm, by bringing thither an over supply 
of air, which again rebounds back, thus creating shi^ng circular currents of revo- 
lution throughout the temperate zones. Those places which happen to fall under that 
portion of these currents, which moves from the poles, will experience great cold, while 
those places falling under that portion of them which moves from the equator, will ex- 
perience moderate weather. It is to this struggle of the polar atmosphere with the up- 
per current of the equatorial atmosphere, to reimburse to the temperate regions, the at^ 
mosphere of which the trade winds are constantly draining them, and not less to the 
eddies and currents of revolution which the surface motion of the polar atmosphere, 
the course of which is very much governed by the particular configuration of the earth's 
surface, produces, that we are to ascribe those incessant and often sudden changes of 
temperature, and those frequent and irre^ar rains and showers so peculiar to the tem- 
perate zones. The polar atmosphere as it rushes towards the tropics, rapidly cools down 
the atmosphere with which it comes in contact, and always produces snows or rains. 
Hence in the temperate zones the predominancy of moisture in the winter, at which 
period the polar currents chiefly prevalL 

The arrangement of the lands and seas, often gives to the atmospheric circles of re- 
volution spoken of in the preceding paragraph, something of a stationary character. 
Throughput the whole extent of the continent of North America, there is a great valley 
running north and south, a little inclined to the east along the eastern foot of the Rocky 
mountains from the Arctic sea, up the valley of Mc Eenzie's river, and down the valley of 
the Mississippi, to the gulf of Mexico. The'polar atmosphere during the winter, in con- 
stant successive gales, rushes furiously down.this valley, producing what are known in the 
gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean sea, as Northers. The surplus of air thus forced into 
these regions, moves off through the north Atlantic, constituting that south-west wind, 
which is observed to be the prevailing wind of that ocean ; and this south-west wind, 
blowing during the winter against the western coast of Europe, produces there that re- 
markable mildness of climate to which we have already referred. The great ocean cur- 
rent of the Gulf Stream constantly carrying off, in the same direction, a supply of warm 
water, tends to the same result ; and this Ghilf Stream is itself occasioned by the water 
being heaped up in the gulf of Mexico by the constant action of the trade winds. 
Striving to recover its level, the surplus water flows out between Cuba and Florida, 
where the effect of the trade vdnd is least constant and powerful, and thence north-east- 
erly along the coast of North America. Thus we see that the physical structure of 
North America exercises a most important and perpetual influence upon the climate of 
Europe. As the Arctic sea (to the north of Europe) is constantly supplied with warm 
water from the tropical regions, it remains unfrozen, and even when the north wind blows 
it never brings with it, from that quarter, that excessive degree of cold which the same 
wind produces in central North America and central and eastern Asia, where it becomes 
cooled down to a very low point by its long journey over the ^ozen northern regions of 
those two continents. 

It is observed that mountianous regions are far more rainy than level plains. The 
lofty mountain peaks becoming very much cooled, cool the air that passes over them, 
and compel it to part with a portion of its moisture. In this way constant showers 
are produced. Indeed it is only in the neighborhood of high mountains, that in what 
we have called the tropical zones, rains ever occur, except during the regular rainy sea- 
sons ; and hence the neighborhood of mountains, is, in those zones, essential to culti- 
vation. 



38 STRUâ‚¬TUEE OF THE EARTH. 



VHL GEOLOGICAL STRUCTURE OP THE EARTH. 

Within the last fifty years, the science of Geology, that is, the science of the stractnrc 
of the earth, and the investigation of the progressive changes by which its existing sur- 
face has, through countless ages, been moulded into its present form, has been pursued 
with great zeal and ardor. Instead of sitting down, content to make theories or fonn 

f)robable guesses in their closets, the modern geologists have carefully examined very 
arge portions of the earth's surface ; and no sooner has any theory been proposed than 
it has been immediately subjected to the severe test of fact and observation. The con- 
sequence has been that this science has. made very remarkable progress, and that it still 
advances every day. 

Several points have been already established, very contrary to the prevailing belief of 
mankind, by evidence too powerfm to be resisted by any man of science. One of these 
points is, that although the existence of man upon the globe, and of the present species 
of plants and animals, appears to be comparatively recent, yet that the globe itself has 
existed for a vast length of ages, during which its surface has undergone the most aston- 
ishing revolutions, and has been successively inhabited by races of plants and animals 
long since extinct, and bearing only a resemblance more and more distant to existing 
species. Imbedded in the rocks, clay, mud, sand and gravel, which form the present 
surface of the earth, are the remains of those extinct species, preserved in a most remark- 
able manner, and furnishing a regular series commencing in the deeper stratified rocks, 
with the more simple forms of marine plants and animals, and gradually progressing 
till in the most recent deposits, the more perfect and complicated forms are arrived at 
There is a most remarkable identity in the shells and other animal remains found in 
rocks similarlv situated in the geological series, in whatever part of the earth they exist; 
and it is by the identity of these remains, that rocks in different parts of the earth, pre- 
senting very little resemblance in external aspect, are identified as belonging to the same 
geological formation. 

Another conclusion in which all geologists agree, is, that the existing continents were 
at some distant periods submerged under the sea, out of which they have been raised at 
different times by some internal force, generally acting with greatest power and effect 
upon their central portions. This explains the physical structure of the continents, and 
of all large islands, which rise from the sea on all sides towards an interior elevated ta- 
ble land, often crowned with ridges of mountains. The mountains themselves, wherever 
found, are but indications of an excessive action of the internal force at that point, caus- 
ing the mountains to rise and bulge out above the surface. It is also by the action of 
this internal force, that we must explain the inclined and broken condition in which the 
strata composing the earth's surface, are generally found ; the broken upturned edges of 
these strata, more or less inclined, often forming the existing surface, thus revealmg to 
the curiosity and examination of the geologist, miles and miles in perpendicular depth 
of the crust of the earth, of which he could in no other way have known any thing. 
It is by observing the superposition of the strata thus displayed, which always follows a 
certain uniform order, that the geologists have determined the relative geological age of 
the different stratified rocks, ascribing to each a greater antiquity the deeper it lies. 

The horizontal line of contact of the surface of the ocean with the solid land gives 
the contour which we see on maps, the form of which depends entirely upon the de- 
gree of elevation to which the land has attained, since on many points, it would be en- 
tirely changed by a slight elevation or depression. On some coasts, a few feet more or 
less in the depth of the water, would diminish or increase the extent of land by many 
miles. Suppose the American continent to be lowered 1000 feet only, and it 'vwuld be 
deprived of almost the whole of its really valuable land, reduced in fact to a mere spine 
as compared with its existing form. Permanence of the contours of the lands, supposes 
indeed a stability of their whole mass, which seems not yet to have been entirely at- 
tained, and which we know certainly did not exist in ecurlier geological epochs, even 
those the nearest to our own. The shape of the masses of land during those epochs, 
was so different firom what it is at present, that we should hardly recognize, them, and we 



STRUCTURE OF THE EARTH. 39 

know by companng the fossils of the different epochs, that great changes in climate and 
in denized beings were the consequences of this change of form. 

What is the force by which the continents have thus been upheaved from the bottom of 
the sea ? Upon this point geologists are not yet perfeciiy agreed ; yet the opinion is fast 
becoming very general among them,Hhat the central portion of the globe is in a heated 
and molten state ; that the apparently solid earth upon which we tread is but a thin 
crust of a few miles, enclosing within it a molten mass ; and that it has been the ex- 
plosive struggles of this melted interior which have repeatedly broken up the earth^s 
crust, dislocated the once horizontel strata, and upheaved the lands from the bosom of 
the sea. 

However extraordinary this opinion may appear to those who have not considered the 
subject, though it be as abhorrent to the prejudices and common notions of mankind as 
the doctrine of the astronomers respecting the daily rotetion and annual revolution of 
the globe, yet it is supported by some very strong arguments. In the first place, the ex- 
istence of volcanoes shows that there is some melted matter somewhere, and the long 
chains of these volcanoes evidently connected with each other, and operated upon by 
some common cause, furnish evidence that these reservoirs of melted matter are not 
limited and local, but of great extent The phenomena of earthquakes, which evident- 
ly are closely connected with volcanoes, and which affect by the same shock or series of 
shocks, very extensive portions of the earth's surface, passing sometimes under the whole 
breadth of the ocean from one continent to another, can only arise from some great in- 
ternal force not local and limited, but general. 

Again, astronomers have calculated from the observed power of the earth's attraction, 
that the whole mass of the globe, taken together, has a density and gravity four times 
and a half as great as that of water at the earth's surface. But if the internal contents 
of the earth were not subject to a very expansive internal power, according to the well 
established laws of attraction by which the force of gravity increases as me square of 
the distance diminishes, the internal parts of the earth ought mutually to attract and 
consolidate each other in such a ratio that the total gravity of the earth, suppose it of 
the same size as now, would be far greater than it now is. What prevents the opera- 
tion of this law, unless it be the well known expansive power of heat acting upon the 
molten internal contents of the globe to counteract the force of gravity ? 

It is a fact well esteblished by experiments made in many deep mines, that after the 
surface of the earth has been so far penetrated, that the effects of external variations of 
temperature are no longer felt, thenceforward as the perforation grows deeper the atmos- 

eiere becomes warmer, and that too in the very rapid ratio of one degree of Farenheit 
r every 101 feet of descent. Hence in all Artesian wells, carried to a great depth, thfe 
skater comes up warmer and warmer in proportion as the well is carried deeper, and thus 
ts explained the existence of warm and hot springs, the water in proportion to its heat 
rising from a greater depth.. 

But if existing phenomena happening every day before our eyes, tend to pipve the 
internal heat of the earth, the proofs of this fact, derived from geology, are much greater. 
The older organic remains, whether animal or vegeteble, are entirely of such a character 
that they only could have existed in a very warm climate. They bear anolagy only to 
those plante and animals which are now found in the hottest regions of the earth. It is 
only in the most recent deposite that we find remains analogous to the existing inhabi- 
tants of the colder and more temperate regions. 

Ancient remains of plante and animals, such as gigantic ferns and palms, and im- 
mense herbivorous creatures far larger than the largest existing animals, and of course 
requiring a greater supply of vegeteble food, are found in all latitudes of the globe, as 
well under the Arctic circle as near the equator. Hence it is concluded that Sie earth 
must, in former ages, have enjoyed a uniform temperature exceeding that now felt in 
the tropics. But it is impossible from astronomical considerations that such an uniform 
heat could ever have been derived from the sun ; it is therefore concluded that the inter- 
nal heat of the earth in former ages, before the earth had cooled down to its present 
8tate, must have been such as to furnish all parte of the globe with a tropical climate in- 
dependently of the heat of the sun.

eration of earthquakes far m<Mre tremendous than any of which history farnishea the 
record. They find immense masses of unstratified rocks which bear the plainest marb 
of having once been in a state of fusion, fcÂ»rced up ttm)ugh the broken edges of stmts, 
now greatly inclined, and often bent, twisted and much altered by fire, but which bear 
plain marks of having been originally formed by a slow deposit from water graduallj 
settling down exactly like the deposits now forming in the sea near the mouths of mtn 
and at the bottom of every lake. 

From all these considerations, and many others, which our space does not allow^ us to 
particularize, the great body of modern geologists have been led to conclude, that the 
earth once existed in the form of a melted fiery mass in a complete state of fosioA. It 
is to be observed that the figure of the earth bulging out at the equator and defxessed 
at the poles, is precisely the shape which mathematical calculations show that such 
a fluid mass, subject to the rotation and revolution of the earth, would neceseaiily 
assume. 

The earth, in the melted fluid state above supposed, wx)uld of course have no water 
upon it ; it would be expanded to a size v^y much greater than at present, and would 
have about it a vast atmosphere of vapor and gases. And here we may observe, that 
one of the chief constituent elements of the earth, which has been calculated to com- 
pose more than half of its entire volume, we mean oxygen gas, exists in its uncombined 
state in the form of a transparent invisible air. Severed other of the principal elements 
of which the globe is composed, such as hydrogen and nitrogen, are also ^ases. 

According to the established laws of the radiation of heat, this vast melted fluid mass 
is supposed to have given off its heat for ages, till at length a scum-like crust began to 
be deposited, floating upon the interior melted nucleus, with a vast atmosphere (many 
things now solid or fluid, being then gaseous) superincumbent upon it. After such a crust 
had been formed to a considerable extent, we can imagine several causes which might 
occasion it to be repeatedly broken up. As the globe continued to cool, new chenucal al- 
terations would be constantly brought into operation ; some elements inclosed within 
the crust might be forcibly attracted towards other elements exterior to it, and the crust 
might be discolocated by the rushing together of these two elements. Or, if we suppose 
the exterior crust so far cooled down that water began to be deposited, this water nitrate 
ing through the crust, reaching the heat below and converted into steam, might jHoduoe 
tremendous explosions. We are not to suppose that the original crust of the earth 
was composed of the hardened materials of our present rocks. These have evidently been 
concentrated and solidified under an immense pressure. The modern lavas cooling with- 
out pressure upon them, though composed of the same materials with the ancient igneous 
rocks, are of a very porous character ; the pumice stones even float upon water. 

The crust of the earth thus frequently disturbed, still continued, we may suppose, 
by the p^cess of cooling, to grow thicker and thicker, and tiie interior contents of the 
earth by the continual exterior pressure, to grow more and more solid ; and this process 
may be supposed to have gone on, till the deposit of wat^ from the atmosphere became 
so great, that seas began to be formed. In those seas, the stratified rocks began to be 
deposited ; and then too organic life is supposed by the geologists, to have first made its 
appearance. 

It here becomes necessary to state that the first great division of rocks (under which 
term geologbts include not only rocks commonly so called, but all the solid substances 
of the earth, clay, sand, gravel, marl, etc.,) is into stratified, and unstratified. Various 
species of both these great classes of rocks exist, of the most various ages, firom those 
formed vesterday, to those formed uncounted centuries ago. The unstratified rocks, 
called also igneousy from the evident agency of fire or heat in thdr production, including 
the granites^ porphyries^ spenUeSy green stones^ basaUs and lavasj form in general the more 
elevated parts of the earth's surface. They have all evidently once been in the melted 
state, and have cooled under a greater or less degree of pressure : firom which circum- 
stance it has been proposed to d^tinguish the unstratified rocks into two classes, by the 
name of Plutomc and Volcqmc^ the latter to include those which have cooled above oc

between the stratified rocks. They all present the crystalline stracture, the crystals in 
some being very leirge and distinct, and in others, especially the volcanic rocks, so small 
as to be hardly distinguishable. Each of these various rocks is composed of three or 
four distinct minerals, each of which minerals contains several chemicad elements. The 
minerals which go to make up the unstratified rocks, are silex (flint or quartz) feldspoTj 
micctj hornblende^ augUe and oxide of iron, Silex is composed of water, (a combi- 
nation of the two gases, hydrogen and oxygen,) and of an earth called silica, which is itself 
composed of oxygen united to an inflammable metallic base called silicum. Pare silex 
is transparent or translucent, and its lustre is highly vitrious. The transparent variety 
of which the common form is that of six sided pyramids, is called rock crystal When 
purple, it is amethyst. When faint red, it is rose quartz. When its color is dark brown 
or gray, with conchoidal fracture, it is flint In white tuberous masses of a resinous 
lustre, and conchoidal fracture, it is opaly and if a lively play of colors is added, it is 
known BLsprecioiis opal When colored red or brown, by a small per centage of the 
oxide of iron, it is called jewper. When transparent but massive and light-colored, it is 
called chalcedony^ or if flesh-colored, cornelian. When composed of layers of chalce- 
dony of different colors, it is called agate. Reduced to powder, silex becomes sand, and 
forms in this state, a large part of the surface of the earth. Feldspar is composed of 
water, silex, and alumina, and a small portion of potassa, which latter earths are formed 
like silex, from oxygen, united to inflammable metallic bases. It resembles quartz, but is 
not as hard, cleaves more readily, and is not generally transparent Its lustre is feebly vi- 
trious, inclining to pearly. Its color is sometimes green, but generally dull white, often in- 
clined to red or flesh color. Feldspar reduced to powder forms beds of mud or clay. 
Hornblende and augite, which seem to be the same mineral, formed under different cir- 
cumstances, and which difier only in their form of crystallization, contain besides silex and 
alumina a large quantity of magnesia, an earth composed like the others, of a metallic base 
united to oxygen. Its color is g^eraUy some shade of green. When light green, it is acti- 
olite ; when white, tranolUe. When composed of flexible fibres, it is asbestos; and if the 
fibres have also a silken lustre, amianthus. MicOj known by its capacity of division into ex- 
ceedingly thin, transparent elastic plates, genersdly colorless, but sometimes green, smoky, 
or black, contains besides silex and alumina, a portion of lime, potash and soda, elements 
essential to the growth of plants. These earths also are composed of oxygen united to 
metallic bases. All the unstratified rocks contain a greater or less portion of iron, in the 
form of an oxide, to which in general they owe their color, and which in proportion as 
it predominates, gives them a tendency wherever they are exposed to the air, to crum- 
ble and waste away. From rocks thus crumbled, has been formed that gravel so copi- 
00^ distributed over the surfeu^e of the earth. 

The stratified rocks, except those which have an aninjal or vegetable origin, are formed 
from the unstratified rocks, reduced to the state of pebbles, gravel, sand or mud, or all 
combined, and in that state carried to the sea, or some lake, and there deposited, and 
haidened and agglutinated probably by heat 

These stratified rocks are divided into two classes very remarkably distinct from each 
other. In the one class, which underlies the other, and which forms the commencement 
of the geological series, there are no organic remains to be found. Though their strat- 
ified texture is' sufficientiy obvious, yet they have a strongly crystalline structure, (great- 
ly resembling that of the granites, porphyries, and green stones, into which in some 
places they may be observed imperceptibly to pass), and evidentiy resulting from their ex- 
posure to a powerful heat under great pressure, sufficient to have obliterated all traces of 
any organic remains which they might once have contained. From this circumstande, 
these rocks have been called metamorphic^ having been evidentiy chaiiged by heat They 
coDsist principally of vast beds of gneiss^ mica slate and clay slate, including occasion- 
ally layers of carbonate of lime in that crystallized state in which it is known as mar^ 
hie; of carbofuUe of iron, of talk, and of serpentine and of quartz rock. 

Whence came this heat ? The crust of the earth, wherever these metamorphic rocks 
abound, is penetrated at frequent intervals from beneath by ridges or dikes of unstratified 
rocks, from broad noountain chains of granite and porphyry to narrow seams of quartz 
aod basalt of less than an inch in thickness. These ridges and dikes have evidently

been forced up, in a melted state, through breaches or cracks of the stratified rocks, and 
the effect of their heat in twisting, melting, and variously altering the stratified rocks 
through which they rise, is often very obvious. This, however, will not suffice to account 
for the present condition of the metemorphic rocks, which evidently owe their texture to 
the application of some baking heat, uniform, and diffused through their whole extent 

The following illustration will give an idea of the process by which geologists suppose 
these metamorphic rocks to have become exposed to the heat which has changed them. 
K a bar of iron be placed with one end in a furnace, the other end being exposed to the 
air, the bar will become heated, in regular gradation, from the end in the nre to the end out 
of it. At first, the end out of the fire will grow hotter and hotter ; but presently it will at- 
tain to that point at which the heat passes off just as fast as it is received ; and at that point 
the temperature of the exposed encl will remain stationary. If now we cover the exf>osed 
part of the bar with a layer of clay, which, owing to its non-conducting power, diminishes 
the radiation, the end out of the furnace will grow hotter ; if we put on another coating 
of clay, it will grow hotter still ; and in this way, by repeated coatings, we may raise the 
heat of the end out of the fire to a degree almost equal to that of the end in it. In the 
same way, suppose the earth internally hot : the constant radiation might still prevent 
the crust on the outside, from feeling that heat to any great degree ; and layers of mud 
might be successively deposited at the bottom of the ocean ; but as these layers grew 
thicker and thicker, the lower ones would no longer be able to throw off their derived 
heat by radiation as formerly ; and that heat would continue to accumulate till they 
might be brought, almost or quite, to a melted state. It is by this process of derivation 
that geologists suppose the metamorphic rocks to have been heated and partially melted. 
Long afterwards, raised again by subsequent convulsions, from the depths in which they 
were buried, to the surface, they cooled, and in cooling took on a partially crystallized 
form. 

Those stratified rocks containing no fossils, it ha^ been proposed by some geologists to 
include along with the unstratified rocks which are all also without fossils, under the com- 
mon name of Azoic rocks, that is, rocks including no evidences of contemporary life. It Is 
in connection with these Azoic rocks that a large proportion of the metallic ores are found. 
Sometimes they appear to be deposited in immense masses, which would seem to have 
been poured forth in a melted state, or else to be beds formed of transported Augments of 
the original ore. Such seems to have been the case with the specular and magnetic ox- 
ides of iron (those ores from which iron of the best quality is made) as exhibited in the 
celebrated mines of Russia and Sweden, and the Adirondock iron mines of northern New 
York, and stiU more remarkably in the famous iron mountain of Missoiu-i, and in the re- 
cently discovered valuable deposits of iron on the south shore of Lake Superior, between 
Carp river and the Menemonie. But in the case of the more precious metals, the ore is 
generally found in a vein, upon the sides of which, subsequently to the original formation 
of the fissure, it appears to have crystallized in conjunction with other minerals. Such are 
the famous veins of gold-bearing quartz in California, Australia, and along the east slope 
of the AUeghanies, and also the veins of silver ore in North and South America, found 
in the porphitic rocks on the slopes of the Andes. 

The other class of stratified rocks is that denominated the FossiliferouSj because in these 
are found those various fossils or organic remains, so interesting to the geologist and so 
important to his science. 

These fossiliferous rocks are again subdivided into PalcBOzoic, Secondary, and Tertiary. 
The Palaeozoic and Secondary rocks exist in wide extended masses, and would appear to 
have been formed, some at the bottom of deep oceans, and others in vast seas, broad in- 
lets, or swampy morasses. The Tertiary rocks are, generally speaking, found in much 
smaller extent, and appear to have been formed in lakes or estuaries alternately filled with 
salt and fresh water, or on the shores of existing continents. 

1. The older Palceozoic rocks, called by some geologists Transition rocks, by others ^ 
Chrauwacke series, and by others Silurian rocks, consist of immense beds of clay, slate, 
pudding-stpne, and other coarse conglomerates, sandstones and limestones. It is here that 
we discover the first faint traces of organic existence, vegetable and animal, but chiefly the 
latter, in the shape of corals and other creatures of that class, with respect to some of which

it is difficult to say, whether they belong to the animal or vegetable creation ; for these 
two great divisions of organic existence, however distinct and separate in their more per- 
fect forms, seem at their commencement to be almost confounded with each other. 
There are, however, even in the oldest fossiliferous rocks, extensive remains of ani- 
mals of a higher class, belonging to the order called Moluscous ; and even some fishes. 
(For an account of the classification of animals, see Article VIII.) 

Some geologists reckon that part of the Silurian system immediately above the meta- 
morphic rocks, consisting principally of black, greemsh, and purple slates of great thick- 
ness, but containing beds of granular quartz and limestone, sometimes white and crystal- 
line, but more generally black or clouded, as another and separate system by itself. 
Others consider these rocks as that part of the Silurian system which has been most dis- 
turbed by subterranean fires and most altered by proximity to igneous rocks. This sys- 
tem comes to the surface in western New England and eastern New York, and on the 
south shore of Lake Superior, etc, and in the western part of England and in Wales, and 
has been called in America the Taconic^ and in England the Cambrian system. 
This system probably extends over a much greater space of the earth's surface than any 
of the systems of rocks of more recent origin. It has been carefully studied in the west 
of England, where, as well as in the north and east of Europe, it occupies extensive tracts. 
It includes a large part of the state of New York, in which district it has been carefully 
examined, and has been found extending westward beyond Lake Superior, and occupy- 
ing a vast tract of country west of the Alleghanies, from Canada to Alabama. It prob- 
ably forms, also, the eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains. The New- York geologists 
have divided this system, as it appears in that State, into four principal divisions, each 
containing several beds. The lowest and the oldest, called the Champlain division^ cor- 
responding to the English Upper Cambrian Rocks, commences with a quartzose sandstone, 
known as the Potsdam sandstone, which in its extension westward forms the south shore 
of Lake Superior, including the famous Pictured Rocks, and containing, in connection 
with trap, the rich copper veins of that region. Higher up in this division is a very thick 
argillaceous deposit, the Utica slate (IJandielo Flags of the English) and Hudson-river 
group. The Ontario division (corresponding to the Ca/radoe sandstone of England) com- 
mences with a mass of sandstone, above which is the Clinton group, consisting of shales 
and sandstones and including a fossiliferous argillaceous iron ore, coextensive with the 
group (at least in America) and very extensively worked in different States. At the top 
of this division is the Niagara group, commencing with a mass of shale, but presently 
becoming calcareous and terminating in a fine compact limestone, harder than the shales 
above or below, and better fitted to withstand the action of denuding agents. It accord- 
ingly presents bold descents wherever it comes out on the surface, and produces water- 
falls wherever streams cross it. The falls of Niagara and those of the Genesee are formed 
by this rock. In its extension westward, it becomes the lead-bearing rock of Missouri, Iowa, 
and Wisconsin. The next highest, or HUderburg division, corresponding to the Wenhch 
Rocks of the British geologists, is a succession of highly fossiliferous liSiestones with the 
intervention of only occasional beds of grits and shales. The lowest bed of this division 
is the Oneida salt group, the water obtained from which, in New York, famishes by 
evaporation immense quantities of salt. The Erie division, corresponding to the Upper 
and Lower Ludlow Rocks of England, consists of a thick mass of shales and sandstones. 
The entire thickness of this Silurian system, commencing with the Potsdam sandstone, 
is, when well developed, not less than 20,000 feet ; but in many places some of the beds, 
and even whole divisions, are wanting, while others thin out, in their extension firom New 
YoA westward. 

2. Next succeeds the Old Red Sandstone series of rocks, called also the Devonian system, 
which besides a series of shells peculiar to itself, abounds with skeletons of immense 
fishes of the most singular forms, covered with plates of bone faced externally with enamel, 
the jaws solid bone, not covered with integuments, while the internal skeleton was not 
*>onjr but cartilaginous. 

This formation consists almost entirely of a sandstone of a red color, admitting how* 
ever of division into th^ee parts, though with different characters in different pikces. The 
lowest is a thin beaded argillaceous sandstone of fine materials and easily splitting into 



44 STRUCTUBB OF THE EARTH. 

tbin sheets, &om which circnmstance it has been called tiUsUme. The middle poitioB m 
composed of nodules or concretions of limestone imbedded in a paste of red sand ai^ 
shale, called by English geologists comstone* Though very partially developed in some 
regions, it is yet a very permanent member of the system. .The highest member k a 
mass of red sandstone often passing into a coarse conglomerate. In England this fov- 
mation occupies a band of several miles in width, extending from the borders of WakÂ» 
north through Scotland to the Orkney's, and not less than ten thousand feet thick. In 
the United States it forms the Catskill mountains in New York, being in fact in- 
cluded as an upper member of the Erie group, and extends south and west so aÂ« to un- 
derlie the coal fields of Pennsylvania and Virginia, but nowhere with an apparent thick- 
ness of more than 3000 feet. 

3. Above this comes the carbotdferom system^ of which the lowest member is the carbtm' 
iferous or momUain limestone^ composed of cajtbonate of lime (a compound of oxygen, 
carbon, and the metallic base of lime) compact and dark, from 600 to a 1000 feet thick, 
and containing an immense quantity of shells, though sometimes it loses the character of 
limestone and becomes a sandstone or conglomerate. Frequently it appears to be oom- 
posed almost wholly of shells and corals, and must have been slowly formed, in an im* 
mense series of ages, by the gradual deposit of these shells at the bottom of the sea. 
The shells composing immense masses of this rock are sometimes so minute as only to 
be distinguishable by a microscope. The lime and carbon so abundant in these rodcB, 
distinguish them in a remarkable manner from the older formations. It contains the ott 
of lead in considerable abundance, being their chief depository in England, and forming 
in our Western States the upper portion of our lead-bearing deposits. Above this lime- 
stone comes the millstone grit, generally drab colored, sometimes red, often as thick as 
the limestone, but with few fossils, and these mostiy vegetable. It is generally cxiatse 
grained and often passes into a conglomerate. Above the millstone ffrit come the coal 
measures^ composed of a vast number of beds of shale, or indurated clay and sandstone, 
alternating with layers of coal and iron stones and about 3000 feet thick. This coal, 
which consists of several beds distributed through the measures, is almost wholly composed 
of the remains of immense palms, ferns, and other tropical plants, of which the traces 
now first become abundant, and which seem to have grown in immei\se marshes, flooded 
from time to time by the sea, in which the intervening beds of shale and sandstone were 
deposited. These beds of vegetable remains, sometimes a few inches, sometimes several 
feet thick, a few as manv as 60, are supposed to have been afterwards covered by other 
deposits, and carbonated bv the propagation of the internal beat. The anthracite coal 
appears to have been buried to a greater depth and subjected to a greater heat and pres- 
sure than the bituminous. Brought to the surface again, by subsequent convulsions, 
the coal now crops out in various places, and sometimes, as among the Alleghanies, forms 
the tops of mountains, having been lifted up bodilv in great detached masses, by the rise 
of those mountains from beneath it. The carboniferous group is also distinguished by 
immense skeletoiy of fishes, even exceeding those of the old red sandstone. Brintt 
springs, as those for instance of the valley of the Kenhawa, are often found in the 
carboniferous system strong enough to be used in the manufacture of salt, but they are not 
peculiar to it, being found equally in older and newer rocks. The iron stone occurs some- 
times in nodulous concretions, often round some organic nudeus, or it is an argillaceous 
ore, having a slaty structure. In either case it consists of subordinate, beds in the shale. 
This ore is extensively worked especially in England, but the iron is of an inferior qual- 
ity. There are three principal varieties of coaL The common bituminous, containing 40 
per cent of bitumen with some sulphur, kindles easily, but emits much smoke, and 
cakes in burning ; the cannel, containing 20 per cent of bitumen, without sulphur, kin- 
dles easily without much smoke, but does not cake ; the anthracite, containing scarcely 
any bitumen or sulphur, kindles with difficulty, emits but little smoke or flame, but boras 
with intense heat. 

Though the coal is generally confined to the uppermost of the three great divisions of 
the carboniferous system, nevertheless beds of it sometimes alternate with beds of the 
millstone grit. This is especially the case in the north of England and in ScotlaJid, 
and to a considerable extent in the United States. Sometimes bed^ of coal are inter- 



STRUCTURE OF THE EARTR 49 

posed even in the carboiiiferons limestone, so that the distinction into three divisional 
disappears, the whole system becoming coal measures. Where coal is quarried in large 
quantities, a shaft is sunk through the overlying strata to the coal beds along which the 
dicing is carried, pillars of coal being left to support the roof, the coal dug out being 
raised to the surface, and the mines kept free of water by steam power. This is the case 
in England, where the coal generally lies at a great depth, but over a large part of the 
coal fields of the United States, which are very extensive west of the Alleghanies, it has 
not yet become necessary to sink shafts; the coal cropping out from hill sides, and it be^ 
infif found more economical to strip off the outer cover than to work a subterraneous 
g^ery. 

The carboniferous system exists more or less abundantly all over the earth. It occurs 
in almost all thp countries of Europe, but especially in Great Britain. The largest de- 
posits known are however in the United States. A great coal field some 60,000 square 
miles in extent covers western Pennsylvania, north-western Virginia and south-eastern 
Ohio. There is another great coal field still larger probably, but the limits of which are not 
yet accurately known, stretching across Illinois from Kentacky into Michigan and Iowa. 

The fossils of the coal measures are mostiy vegetable, but are found chiefly, not in 
the coal itself, but in the strata above or below it. One called the stigmaria^ is found in 
the lower shales very abundantly, and to . the exclusion of almost every other form. It 
consists of a large dome-shaped mass, often four feet in diameter, with large branches ot 
roots spreading off horizontally to a distance of twenty feet Petrified tree ferns have 
occasionally been found apparentiy a mere continuation of the stigmaria, which, from 
this circumstance, have been supposed to be the roots of the immense tree ferns, the 
leaves of which so abound jn the upper shales. These tree ferns appear to have at- 
tained a height of 50 or 60 feet, and a diameter of four feet They have received the 
name of Sigillaria^ in consequence of the seal like impressions with which the surface is 
covered, and which are the soars left where the fix)nds or leaves had fallen off. These 
fern leaves of various species are the most abundant fossils of the system. The Lepido^ 
dendron (tree covered with scalesj most neariy resembled in general appearance our pres- 
ent forest trees. Specimens are lound four feet in diameter and seventy feet high. In 
its botanical character it combined several of the characteristics of the trailing club 
mosses and of the Norfolk Island pine. The Calamite, another of these fossils, was a 
plant resembling in its pointed and striated surface the equisetum (horse tail rush), but 
of the diameter sometimes of a foot 

The carboniferous system closes the series of rocks denominated PalcBOzoic, or those of 
the times of ancient life, and to them succeeds the Secondary, divided into the New Red 
Sandstone^ the Oolitic^ and the Chalky and consisting in the whole of about 80 distinct 
groups, each with its peculiar fossils. 

1. The lower division of the new red sandstone, called the Permian system^ consists of a 
thick body of sandstones generally red, with occasional alternations of shelly argillaceous 
beds, succeeded by a series of ma^nesian limestones, often, as in Germany, containing 
rich veins of copper. The upper division of the new red sandstone called the Triassic 
system^ is made up of red conglomerate, of a limestone called, from its composition, by 
the Grerman name of MuscheUcalk, (shelly limestone,) and a series of variegated marls 
and sandstones. In England it abounds in salt springs, salt beds and beds of gypsum ; 
bat these minerals are by no means peculiar to this formation. 

The Permian portion of this system contains impressions of fishes of that more an- 
cient family of which the upper lobe of the tail was the larger, the spine continuing 
into it Fishes with the lobes of the tail equal, first made their appearance in the Trias- 
sic division. The remains of birds and of Saurians or lizard-like animals also begin to 
be found here. On the whole, these rocks contain very fqw fossils, but they have pre- 
served with remarkable distinctness the impression made upon them countiess ages ago, 
when they existed in the shape of soft sand or mud, as the beach or shore of some ex- 
panse of water. The strata of this formation are often covered with ripple marks, with 
son cracks occasioned by contraction while drying, or with depressions produced by 
rain-drops, the pits being sometimes so perfect as to show the direction in which the rain 
fell â€” so similar to those produced at the present day by similar causes as to leave no 



4a STRUCTURE OF THE EARTH. 

doubt as to their origin. The tracks of animals are also well preserved, some of tikem 
produced by reptiles, and some probably by marsupial animals intermediate, as it were, 
between reptiles and the higher order of mammalia, but most of them by birds. The 
tracks of more than thirty dmerent species of birds, some of them of gigantic size, have 
been distinguished by Professor Hitchcock in the sandstones of the Connecticut valley. 
Fishes occasionally appear in the Silurian, and very abundantlv in the Devopian rocks, 
but it is in the New Red Sandstone that traces and remains of birds, reptiles and mar- 
supial animals are first found. 

All the members of this system are well developed on the continent of Europe, and in 
England all parts of it except the Muschelkalk. The Triassic, or upper portion of it 
occurs in North America in detached portions, probably as part of a continuous formaiioiu 
appearing in Nova Scotia, the eastern part of Maine, the valley of the Connecticut, and 
from New Jersey south through Pennsylvania, Maryland, and to South Carolina. Like 
many other of the sandstones, it furnishes good building materials, but not so durable as 
some others. 

2. The Oolitic system which succeeds the New Red Sandstone, is made up of three 
principal subdivisions. The Lias consists of a series of fissile beds of argiDaceous lime- 
stones, of marls and of clays, the two latter, unlike, all the lower strata, not hardened 
into rocks. The oolite consists of alternations of clay, sandstones and limestone, some 
of the limestones having an oolitic structure, composed, that is, as if of little eggs or 
^obes the size of a pea, â€” a circumstance which has given its name to the whole series, 
tiiough this characteristic is by no means found in all of its parts, nor is it exclusivelj 
confined to this formation. The coral rag^ which forms the central part of the oolite, b 
principally a mass of corals and broken shells. The third and highest number of the 
oolitic system is the Wealderty consisting of calcareous beds, followed by sandstone and 
terminated by the Wealden day. 

This system is highly calcareous, furnishing valuable building materials, and is di^ 
tinguished by the amount and variety of its organic remains. Corals and molnsks occur 
in great abundance. The upper oolite in the south of England contains stumps and 
trunks of coniferous trees of large growth, and of other plants rooted in a black carbo- 
naceous layer, evidently the soil in which they grew â€” a species of vegetation interme* 
diate between that of the coal measures and that which now exists. But what especially 
characterizes this system are abundant remains of saurian reptiles of extraordinary size 
and shape. The Ichthyosaurm and the Plesiosaurus were marine animals intermediate 
between a crocodile and a whale, and not less than 30 or 40 feet long. The Pteradoc- 
tyle was a reptile with wings like a bat, and of the size of the largest eagle. The -^I'o- 
nodon was a land lizard 70 feet long. This formation is well developed in England, and 
except the Wealden, on the continent of Europe. Its counterpart in this country is to 
be found in the valley of the James River near Richmond, a highly arenaceous rock lOOO 
feet thick and containing a bed of coal 40 feet thick, and extending, with some similar de- 
posits of coal, as far south as Alabama. 

3. The upper system of the Secondary rocks is known as the Cretaceous fomuitio9L, or 
the . Chalk. The lower part consists of green-sand interstratified with beds of clay. The 
intermediate portion is a mixture of argillaceous green-sand and impure chaUc The 
upper portion is composed of chalk which is a friable and nearly pure carbonate of lime, 
separated at intervals of from three to six feet by layers of flint, either in the form of no- 
dules or pebbles, or of continuous strata. These characteristics, however, of the chalk 
formation as it exists in the south of England, are but partially recognized elsewhere. 
Thus on the slopes of the Alps, the equivalent of the English green-sand seems to be a 
series of chrystalline limestones, long regarded as primitive, and known as the Neocomum 
system^ while the American green-sand found in New Jersey, etc., seems to be the geo- 
logical equivalent of the whitÂ« chalk of England. The fossils of the chalk are very dif- 
ferent from those of the oolite, seeming to show that while the latter was formed in 
estuaries and shallow waters, the former was deposited in deep seas. Microscopic shells 
are often so abundant as to constitute a large proportion of the mass. Zoophites, snch 
as corals, sponges and star-fish, are very numerous ; also molusks, including cephalapoda, 
the highest family of that order, â€” but vertebrated animals no longer appear. 



STBUCTUEE OF THE EARTH. 47 

The chalk and green-sand are largely developed in England, and the counterparts of the 
same system are extensively found in southern Europe flanking the mountain ranges and 
extending into Asia. In this country the system commences with the green-sand and soft 
limestones of New Jersey, and following the eastern slope of the AUeghanies to its south- 
ern termination, bends round in a north-west direction, and is continued into Missouri 

In the Tertiary deposits, we discover the commencement of a new order of things, 
gradually approaching, more and more, to that which now exists. It is evident that 
some vast change in the condition of the earth must have occurred between the depo- 
sition of the uppermost beds of^the secondary strata, and the commencement of the 
Tertiary ; for though the Tertiary strata abound in fossil remains, they do not contain 
one single species or genus identical with those contained in the Palaeozoic and Secondary 
strata. These strata, the groups of which are much less distinguishable from each other, 
either by mineral character or peculiar fossils, than those of the older formations, consist 
of a great variety of beds of clay, sand and soft limestones. As they seldom overlap each 
other, so as to indicate their respective ages, they have been arranged into four classes, 
according as they contain, among the marine shells deposited with them, a less or a 
greater proportion of such as belong to families now existing. The first division, called 
Eoceney (a name indicating the dkwn of the existing state of thin^,) contains only 
four per cent of existing species. The second, called Miocene^ includes those strata 
which possess among their fossil shells some ten per cent of existing shells. The third, 
the Pleocene^ has, among its fossils, forty per cent of existing species ; and the fourth, the 
Pleistocene, approaches towards an exact resemblance, in its fossil shells, to those species 
which now exist 

To this period belong those great beds of gravel with which the surface of many north- 
em countries is overspread, and which appear to have been brought from a great distance 
by a succession of tremendous floods. But this is a subject still involved in vei^ great ob- 
scurity. Those deposits called Drift, are found in America as far south as Pennsylvania and 
the Ohio river, and extending east and west from Nova Scotia to the Rocky mountains. 
They are found in Europe as far south as Germany and Poland, and extending from the 
Atlantic to the Ural mountains. Also in the vicinity of the Alps and other mountains, 
and in the colder parts of South America. This drift consists of irregular accumula- 
tions of earth and gravel of different degrees of fineness, but containing masses of stone 
called boulders, often of many tons weight. From the fact that rocks of the same litho- 
logical character are found in strata at a distance often of one or two hundred miles 
north, and from the polished, striated and grooved surface of the intervening rocks, the 
coDclusion is that these boulders have been washed along from that distance, leaving these 
marks behind and accumulating where they are now found. In the valleys of the drift 
regions are found deposited beds of blue and gray clay fit for bricks and coarse pottery, 
also beds of sand, sometimes evenly spread, but often accumulated in irregular mounds 
and ridges. In regions not covered with drift â€” as in the southern parts of Europe 
and of the United States, the pleistocene deposits are followed without apparent change 
of conditions, by those now in progress. 

/Though generally speaking, not so continuous over extensive shores as the older forma- 
tions, yet the tertiary formations constitute the surface of a large part of Europe. In 
America the earlier portion is found along the sea-board from New Jersey to Louisiana, 
extending back from ten to one hundred miles, while the later strata are found in de- 
tached portions in the Eastern and Middle States. They cover also a large sur- 
face in South America and India. They are distinguished from the lower strata 
by being less consolidated, though the limestone is sometimes solidified, resembling 
older beds. They have generally less thickness than the lower rocks. In a few instances 
they have been thrown into inclined portions, but are generally little disturbed, and 
raised but a few hundred feet above the present sea level. 

That which most distinguishes the Tertiary deposits, is the absence of deep sea fos- 
sils ; the first appearance of existing genera of sea shells ; and especially the skeletons, 
in which some of them abound, of vast animals of the class mammalia, including both 
the carnivorous and the herbivorous. The wildest creations of fancy, the most extraor- 
dmary accounts of fabulous creatures, fall altogether short of the numerous strange and 



48 STRUCTURE OP THE EARTH. 

wonderfhl animak whose bones have of late rears been disinterred, and the animals tiiera- 
selves reconstructed, as it were, by the skill of the comparative anatomist. The science of 
comparative anatomy, founded by the celebrated Cfuvier, and carried by him to a high de- 
gree of perfection, has shed a great light upon the ancient condition of the globe. Â£ pro- 
â€¢ceeds upon the principle, well established by a long series of comparisons, that the sMe- 
tons of all vertebrated animals are constructed according to one general idea ; and diat aD 
changes in the shape of those animals, are brought about not by varying the general plan 
of the skeleton, but only by varying the details of that plan. It has been farther ascw- 
tained, that any change in any one bone is always attended by corresponding changes 
in all the rest, and that the structure of the soft parts is dependent on the structure of tke 
bones. Such is the skill that has been attained upon this subject, that naturalists, from 
any one single bone, and more especially from the teeth and the bones of the extremitieii. 
and even from a single scale of a fish, are able to tell the general fi^re, habits, and char- 
acter of the animal, and to point out its place in the order of classification. 

Although all the Tertiary beds contain a less or greater quantity of the remains of in- 
vertebrated animals, which still exist on the globe, it is only in the very upper strati, 
which are now every day forming, that remains are found of any of the higher order of 
existing animals, especially of apes and monkeys ; nor, except in the recent strata now 
forming, have there been found any indications of the existence of man. 
â€¢ It is not to be suppK>sed that all the various strata are anywhere found succeeding each 
other in the order above described ; or that they are difrased with anything like uni- 
formity, over the earth's surface. The geological succession of rocks has only been de- 
termined by a comparison of their relative situation in difierent parts of the earth. Wc 
may be sure that a rock of a newer formation will never be found underlaying a rock of 
an older formation ; but many links in the chain of succession are everywhere -wanting; 
and the oldest and newest rocks may thus be seen in actual contact Nor do the geojo^ 
gists find any difficulty in accounting for this ; for upon the supposition of a gradual for- 
mation of the present crust of the earth by a series of successive deposits, alternately 
raised above and sunk below the level of the sea, by the operation of an internal force, it 
must always have happened, with respect to any given portion of the surface, either that 
it formed the bottom of some sea or ocean far distant from land, where few or no depos- 
its could be made ; or else the bottom of a sea adjoining a continent, where it was liaMe 
to receive constant successive deposits ; or else that, raised above the surface, it w^as ex- 
posed to lose, by floods and abrasions, a part of the depK>sits already made upon it. It is 
thus easy to exptain why, in some places, successions of layers are found, wWch are 
wholly wanting in others. 

The terrible convulsions by which the crust of the earth appears to have been displaced 
and broken up, at different geological epochs, thus shifting the bed of the ocean, and 
destroying, in succession, whole families and races of animated beings, may be explained 
without supposing any interruption in, or departure from, those established laws of it- 
ture which are still in permanent operation. For, besides those causes for this phenone* 
non which have already been mentioned, we must recollect, supposing the earth to bare 
once been in a melted state, that as it continued to cool down, the fluid interior ma.^ 
would contract ; and that the solid crust, thus deprived of its support, would necessariJj 
crack and collapse, in some places sinking, in others rising, and in all passing from a 
hori;!ontal to a more or less inclined position. Through the openings thus made, the in* 
temal melted matter would, by the pressure of the fragments of the broken crust, be 
pushed up, and would thus pierce through and even overtop the strata which had been 
formed over it. A new series of deposits might then take place, during a long succession 
of ages, in newly-formed seas ; till at length the diminution of heat having again con- 
tracted the melted nucleus of the earth, the crust might be again broken up, whence a 
new series of revolutions would follow. It is evident that the thicker the superincumbeiK 
crust came to be, and the more the central mass was consolidated, the less frequent and feÂ« 
violent these changes would become ; which seems to correspond with observed facte,â€” 
the more recent deposits being far less distorted and broken than the more ancient All 
however, without exception, are more or less traversed by perpendicular dikes of greater 
or less thickness, apparentiy formed by the cooling of melted matter injected firom below. 



STRUCTURE OF THE EAKTH, 49 

â€¢ 

We haTe alreftdy obaerved that water filtering Arong^ breaches in the surfece, and eiMi- 
yerted to steam by the internal heat, might give rise to tremendous convulsions ; and it 
is to this agency that modern geologists are inclined to ascribe the earthquakes and vci^ 
canic eruptions which still, in some countries, produce very violent convulsions and sSfotd 
a specimen, on a small scale, of the agencies firom which may be supposed to have arisen 
the existing state of the earth's surface. 

Nor do geologists suppose that this warping and contracting of the crust of ihe eaith 
has even yet, come to an end. They think they have discovered evidence of a change 
in the level of continents and islands still going on, the land .in some places gradually 
sinking beneath- the ocean, and in others, as gradually rising aboye it ; upon the same 
principle that as one end of a board sinks, the other must rise. Facts are adduced to 
show, that the coast of North America from the mouth of the St. Lawrence to that of 
the Hudson, is graduaUy sinking ; while the coast from the mouth of the Hudson to the 
extremity of Florida, is as gradually riung. 

It has even of late been ingeniously argued, that the multitude of islands in the Pa- 
oific ocean, whose existence has heretofore been ascribed to the joint operation of sub* 
marine volcanoes and the coral insect, are in fact but the last remaining highlands of a 
vast continent slowly sinking beneath the surface of the ocean. 

It is unquestionably the fact, that the successive series of stratified rocks, exhibit in 
their fossil remains, a constantly progressive advancement in the scale of animal exist- 
ence, rising by slow degrees, through a long succession of ages, to the more perfect 
forms, and leading to the conclusion that man is one of the most recent inhabitants of the 
globe. Yet this progression is not by any means to be understood as proceeding in any 
strict or precise order, or to be at all apparent with respect to particular families. Thus, 
among the fossils of the very oldest fossiliferous rocks, we find specimens of cephalopo- 
dous molusca, the most perfect family of the class of invertebrated animals ; while many of 
the fishes of the old red sandstone, and saurian animals of the chalk, exceed in com- 
plexity and perfection of structure, anv>existing animals of those classes. 

Fossil botany is much less advanced than fossil zoology. Plants are far more destruc- 
tible than the bony parts of animals, and have been much less perfectly preserved. Be- 
side, the leaves, flowers and fruit, upon which the. generic distinctions of plants depend, 
are, for the most part, wanting in the fossils. The very few and imperfect fossil plants 
fonnd below the coal-measures, appear to belong to the class of sea-weeds. The coal- 
measures introduce us to an abundance of vegetables of which about 50 distinct kinds 
have been made out, including some tree ferns of great size. Vegetable fossils to a 
greater or less extent continue to be found above the coal. They belong to families now 
peculiar to the torrid zone, but they are less abundant and less perfectly preserved than 
those of the coal measures. 

Great caution however is to be used in drawing any conclusion from the non-exis* 
tence of remains or indications of certain classes of animals or vegetables in certain 
strata, that they did not exist contemporaneously with those strata. The igneous rocks 
coming from the bowels of the earth in a melted state, can evidentiy contain no trace 
of contemporaneous animals or vegetation, and the metamorphic roc&s may have lost 
through excess of heat, producing chemical efiects, all such traces. Of the stratified 
rocks, many were evidentiy formed at the bottom of deep seas, and could not therefore 
be expected to contain traces of contemporaneous land animals or plants ; while others 
formed in estuaries, lagoons or swamps, would not be likely to exhibit remains of contem- 
poraneous quadrupeds which might have existed on the dry lands of those ages, lands now 
sunk to the bottom of the ocean, while the old ocean bed has been changed into our present 
dry land. 

. Of the metals, excluding those metallic bases whose affinity for oxygen is such that 
they can scarce exist in the metallic form, only nine, viz : iron, copper, lead, tin, zinc, 
manganese, mercury or quicksilver, silver and gold,* exist in any consid^ble quantities, 
or are of much use in the arts ; and even of these, some, such as tin and mercury, are 
confined to a few localities. 

Iron is not only the most important, but altogether the most universal and abundant 
of the metals. It is so generally difiused, that it may be considered one of the great

ooDstikitent dements of tbe fflobe, and k to be found in some bhape or other, in almost 
every geological fonaation. Having a great attraction for oxygen, it is ^nerally foaad 
in the form of an oxide ; though in some parts of the globe it exists in great masses at 
most pure. 

The metallic ores are found either deposited in beds among the other strata, or moie 
commonly in veins which traverse the rocks, especially the older stratified rocks. These 
veins have the appearance of having first existed as cracks or openings, in which tbe 
metallic oxides were subsequently and slowly deposited, in a more or letss crystalli^ 
form. In thus speaking of the metals, we do not include the lately discovered, or cob- 
jectured metallic bases of the earths and alkalies. These indeed would form a great 
part of the bulk of tbe earth ; but so gre^t is their affinity for oxygen, some of them 
Dumiog even in water, that it is excessively difficult to obtain or to keep them in the me- 
tallic state. 

What progress analytic chemistry may hereafter make, we know not; but even at 
ready all the substances, known to us, mineral, vegetable, and animal, have been resolved 
into about 60 elements, of which abojit 30 are metals of verv rare occurrence, and of no 
importance in a general view of the elemental substances of the globe. The remaindo, 
besides the metals already enumerated, and the metallic bsises of the earths and alkalies, 
include four principal gases, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen and chlorine, and three substances 
having a great affinity for oxygen and therefore inflammable, carbon, sulphur, and phospo- 
rus. These simple substances have peculiar tendencies to unite with each qther, called 
by chemists electric aitractionj greauy modified and controlled however, by the agencj 
of heat, electricity, galvanism, and magnetism, agents which chemists are beginning to sap- 
pose to be one and the same under difierent forms. By combinations liurongh th^ 
agencies are derived, from the elements above referred to, sJl the various substances of tke 
globe, many of which, especially vegetable and animal substances, are in a constant pro- 
cess of composition and decomposition through the agency of these same causes. This 
indeed is true even of all mineral substsmces exposed to the action of heat, air and wa- 
ter ; though the process in their case, is generally slower. Thtf power of man over natcue 
consists in a knowledge of these laws, and of the ability thence derived, to modify tbe 
various substances about him for the accomplishment of his own purposes. 

Chemists have observed that the elements out of which aU substances are composed, 
always imite in certain definite proportions, either one part of an element, with one part 
of another element, or two parts of one, with one of another, or three pa^ of one, wH 
one, or two parts of another, and so on, the proportions of the same element in difle^ 
ent combinations, being always multiples of each other. They have also observed that 
in the process of crystallization, (during which portions of one substance dissolved in 
another, unite again into one solid and homogeneous mass,) there is always a tendency to 
take on certain particular forms ; and from these, and other considerations, they have be^ 
led to conclude, that theÂ«.ultimate particles of the elemental substances, consist of atoms, 
vaslly too small to be discerned even by the aid of the most powerful microscopes, but 
still having fixed and definite forms, ana not capable of any further subdivision. 

Carbon, which exists in its perfectly pure state, in the form of the diamond, becomes 
when united with oxygen and hydrogen in the same proportion in which they combine to 
form water, the main constituent of all plants; though a certain portion of potash or 
soda is necessary to them, and indeed they contain greater or less proportions of eight 
or ten of the soUd substances, which are chief components in the earth's surface. Some 
of these substances are more particularly necessary for particular species of plants; 
whence particular species flourish best in soils containing their favorite ingredients. 
Hence it happens that particular geological formations are particularly adapted to tbe 
growth of certain plant^ ; and the geological character of a district may be often dete^ 
mined from the character of its prevailing vegetation. It thus becomes apparent that 
the sciences of geology, mineralogy, and chemistry, are of the utmost importance to a^ 
multure, that art on which mankind are dependent for their daily bread.

IX CLASSIFICATION OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS. 

1. Plants, To facilitate the knowledge of Plants and Animals, of which the existing 
species are so very numerous â€” not. less perhaps than a hundred thousand of each â€” it 
is necessary to adopt some system of classification ; and it will be useful to the reader here 
to state the general outline of the systems of classification employed by recent natur- 
alists. 

Systems of classification may be either NiUural or Artificial. The artificial systems are 
adapted merely to assist the memory, and to aid in the identification of any given species. 
In these systems the most dissimilar species are sometimes brought together, owing merefy 
to an accidental similarity in some one particular. Such is the system of botanic arrange- 
ment, devised by Linnaeus, in which all plants are arranged into twenty-four orders, ac- 
cording to the number of their ^tamens and pistils, with an additional order for the non- 
flowering plants. 

In the natural systems^ objects are classed together according to their general resen^- 
blances,and though often attended with great practical difficulties, they are far more inter- 
esting, instructive and useful. The following are the first great divisions of the natural 
arrangement of plants, now generally received. 

We find one great division of plants^ the seeds of which consist of two lobes having 
between them the germ of the future plant â€” like the bean for instance. These two 
lobes containing the earliest nourishment, become the first two leaves of the plant, which 
grows up, receiving all accessions to itself firom within, the circulation between the fronds 
and the root being carried on, in the interior, and the outside consisting of dead wood. 
These plants continue, after the first year, (if they live more than one) to receive acces- 
sions in length, but not in thickness. The trunk of the palm trees, which belong to this 
.class, when just above the ground, have a diameter as great as when the tree is a hundred 
feet high. From this circumstance plants of this class are called Endogens^ (increasing 
from within) or from the character pf their seeds, Dy-cotyledonous (two lobed). Plants 
of this class abound principally in the warmer climates, and it is to this class, that most 
fossil plants yet discovered, belong. 

Another great class of plants exhibit a spindle-shaped seed with a single lobe, or coty- 
ledon, containing the early nourishment of the plant, and inclosing the germ which puts 
a root downward, and a shoot upward. This upward shoot becomes the future plant, 
and after the first vear, consists of solid wood within, covered by an exterior bark 
of several layers, ana containing the sap vessels, by which a communication is carried on 
between the root and the leaves. One layer of this bark hardens every year and be- 
comes wood â€” the trunk thus growing from the outside. Hence plants of this class 
are called Ezogens (growing from without), or from the character of their seeds, Monch 
cotyledonousj (one lobed). They are characteristic, more particularly of the temperate 
climate. 

The third great natural class of veffetables, consists of the non-flowering plants â€” 
ferns, mosses, sea-weeds â€” hence called Cryptogamae, because their organs of fructifi- 
cation are concealed. These plants are found in all climates, but the coldest climates 
produce hardly any other. 

The subdivisions of these three great natural classes are founded, like those of genera 
and species, upon resemblances of the leaves, flowers, and fruit or seed, towards the 
production of which last, all the other oi^ns of the plant are subservient 

2. Animals. In addition to organs of nutrition, by which the substances necessary 
for their growth, are separated by plants from the air, water, and earth in which they 
grow, and organs of reproduction by which they continue their species, animals pos- 
sess also a nervous system^ by which they feel and perceive, and organs of locomotion, by 
which they are able to move themselves, or some part of themselves, from place to 
place. Yet in the very lowest class of animals, the nervous system is wanting; and even 
as to organs of locomotion they are so defective, tiiat it is hard to say whether they 
ought not rather to be classed as plants. 

The first great division of animals is into Vertebrate and Jbivertebrate ; that is to sayÂ« 



C2 PLANTS AND ANIMALS. 

Chose EDimals which have a skull, back bone, and bony internal skeleton, and those ^ 
mala which have not 

The Vertebrate, the more perfect kind of animals, possess a stomach, and its appurte- 
nances, for the conversion of food into blood ;. a heart and arterial and venous systems, 
for the circulation of that blood through the body ; lungs, or their equivalent, by which 
the blood, previous to its circulation, is able to receive oxygen jfrom the air, and by which 
the superfluous carbon is thrown off in the form of vapor; and a nervous system, con- 
sisting not only of ganglions, or detached nervous masses, sending off nerves to the dif- 
ferent organs, but of a brain and spinal marrow, sending off pairs of nerves on both sides, 
by means of which the processes of perception, thoufi;ht, and emotion are carried on, and 
the motions of the muscles are controlled by the will. 

The Vertebrate Animals are divided into four great classes, each inferior to the otiieria 
the perfection of its orjganization ; these classes are^ 1. Mammalia, 2. Birds, 3. Rep- 
tiles, and 4. Fishes. 

The Mammalia, or highest class of animals, are those which nurse their young, the 
young being separated &om the parent^ alive, and perfectly formed. Animals of this dasB 
have all the organs in the highest degree of perfection and complexity. They are divided 
into nine inferior orders, as follows : 1. Binuma (two-handed), including one gcnuB and 
one species, â€” man ; 2. Quadranuma (four-handed), the ourangs, apes, monkeys, etc. ; 
3. Uamivora (meat-eating), having four subdivisions â€” Cheiroptera^ or bats; Insec^ 
tivora^ or insect-eaters; the true Camivora^ or beasts of prey, including, first, the i%mti- 
grada, those like the bear, which walk on the outspread palm, and second, Digitigradoj 
those like the lion, cat, etc., which walk on the fingers ; lastly, the Amphibia^ seal^ etc, 
living mostly in the water ; 4. Marsupia^ distinguished by a pouch, in which they con- 
ceal and carry their young, as the kangaroo and opossum ; 5. Rodeniia (gnawers), rats 
and squirrels; 6. Edentata (without teeth in the front jaw), sloths, etc ; 7. Pacht^der- 
mata (thick-skinned), as the elephant, horse, hog, and rhinoceros ; 8. RuminanHa (cud- 
chewing), ox, sheep, etc ; 9. CetaciOy whales, which though living in the water, yet 
breathe and nurse their young like the land-animals. 

The division of Mammalia into genera and species is governed by differences in ikfc 
teeth and extremities, according to which the whole structure of the animal is found %Â» 
be modified. 

The next class of vertebrate animals, or Birds^ have an inferior nervous or^nizailon, 
though they possess some of the senses very acutely, and many of them exnibit great 
sagacity. They are or^nized for flight : their bones are hollow, and communicate with 
the lungs, so as te be mled with air. In this and the two following classes, the young 
are separated from the parent in the form of ee^gs, containing a germ, which becomes vrta 
by a process of incubation, or by the naturalheat of the substances among which tiie 
eggs are deposited. 

Birds are divided into five orders, viz. 1. Rapaces (birds of prey) ; 2. Incessores (sit- 
ters or perchers) ; 3. Rasores (sharp-beaked) ; 4. Orall/Uores (waders) ; 6. Natahres 
(swimmers). 

The third class of vertebrate animals is that of Reptiles. The lungs and circulatory 
apparatus of these animals are defective. The circulation is slow, the blood is imper- 
fectly oxygenized, and is cold. These animals pass a great part of their lives in a torpid 
state. They inhabit the sea, rivers, marshes, and the dry land. They include four orders: 
1. Chelonia or tortoises, including the turtles inhabiting the water, and the proper tor- 
toises inhabiting the land ; 2. Sauria or lizards, the crocodile, alligator, chameleon, etc; 
3. Opidia or snakes / 4. Batrachia or frogs. 

The fourth class of vertebrate animals, that of Fishes^ is much less perfectly organized, 
than the three preceding orders. Not only is their blood cold, but the only air they teeathe 
is a small quantity separated from the water by means of the giUs. 

The fishes are far more numerous than aU the other vertebrate animals put tosether, 
and their classification has been attended with some difficulty. Cuvier, the father of mod- 
em zoology, made a subdivision of fishes into the bony and cartilaginous^ founded ontiie 
fact that while those of the first class possess a perfect bony skeleton, those of t^ seoond 
class have a vertebral column simply cartilaginous, and not containing any real bone, 



PLANTS AND ANIA{AL& 69 




fins. The first order he called Acanthopter^an (thorny-finned), the second order mate- 
eopterygian (soft-finned). The Cartilaginous fishes constituted his third order. 

M. .^^siz, a very distinguished living naturalist, has proposed a different classifica- 
tion, founded entirely upon the nature of the scales, which constitute the external cover- 
ing of fishes. He proposes four orders, as follows : 1. Ganoidians (shiny-scaled), the 
fishes of this order being covered by angukr scales, composed internally of bone, and 
coated with enamel ; the scales are regviarly arranged, and entirely cover the skin ; of 
this order are the sturgeon and bony pike of the American lakes ; S. Placoidians (plate- 
scaled), whose skins are irregula/rly covered with plates of enamel, often of considerable 
dimensions, but sometimes reduced to small points, like the shagrin on the skin of the 
sharic, and the prickly tubercles of some other fishes ; 3. Ctenoidiam (comb-scaled), 
covered with horny or bony scales, jagged like the teeth of a comb, on the outer edge, as 
the perch, etc ; 4. Oyclodians (circle-scaled), having scales smooth and simple at the 
margin, and often ornamented at the upper surface, as the herring, salmon, etc The 
existing fishes of the two latter orders are far more numerous than those of the two for- 
mer. The fossil fishes are of the two former orders. 

The Invertebrate Animals have no proper internal skeleton, and of course no brain nor 
spinal marrow. Their nervous system consists only of ganc^lions, or detached nervous 
masses, from which nerves proceed not in pairs but irregularly. One great mass of ner- 
vous matter, situated near the stomach, communicates with the nerves of the external 
8enses,and fulfils the purpose of a brain. They are divided into three great classes, the 
third of which has, of late, been subdivided into two. 

The first class consists of theilfo/t^^ca (soft, pulpy animals), but having generally an ex- 
terior skeleton or hard covering of shell. The nutritive apparatus of these animals is com- 
paratively perfect, but for the most part they exhibit very little intelligence, ^d many of 
them have very limited powers of locomotion. They are divided into seven orders, as follows : 
1. the Op&a/^(2(3k(head-footed), which exhibits the nearest approach to vertebrated ani- 
mals. Some of them even possess an internal osseous skeleton, or something which ap- 
proaches to it. They are also occasionally provided with an external shell, secreted by a 
fleshy skin, called the mantle ; their body is a closed ba^ furnished with a head and promi- 
nent eyes ; on the head are supported numerous complex organs of locomotion and pre- 
hension, and hence their name is derived. The nautilus belonfi;s to this class ; also many 
extinct genera ; 2. the Pteropoda (wing-footed) comprises only a few species, but these 
are incredibly abundant ; they swim in nflyriads through the ocean, forming occasionally 
the food of whales, the largest of living animals. They are provided vdth broad fleshy 
expansions, or fins, which enable them to move rapidly through the water, and distin- 
guish them Â£rom the next order, to which they are in other respects nearly allied ; 3. the 
Gasteropoda (belly-footed), so called from their peculiar method of locomotion, the ani- 
mal gliding along by means of contractions of the fleshy skin with which it is covered. 
This order includes the whole tribe of land and water umvalve shells, with the exception 
only of the Cephalopoda ; 4. the Conchifera (shell-bearers) also includes a very exten- 
sive and well-known group of animals, comprising, with few exceptions, the inhabitants 
<tf all bivalve shells. These exceptions constitute the next order ; 5. The Brachiopoda 
(arm-footed), so named from two spiral arms, placed on either side of the mouth of the 
animal, and, in some species at least, capable of being unrolled to a considerable length, 
and protruded in search of food ; 6. the Vermicata (coated), a group of very singular 
animals, enveloped in a tough skin, but often so deh'cate as to be perfectly transparent ; 
7. the Cirrhopoda (hair-footed), which receive their name from certain hair-like appen- 
dages, by whose rapid motion a species of current is formed in the water, attracting in 
its vortex any light small animals that may be floating about within reach of the mouth, 
by which they are at once seized and crushed. As the first order of the Molusca, the 
Cephalopoda, partake of the structure of vertebrate animals, so this last order combines 
the limbs of the Articulata with the characters or the Molusca, and may almost be looked 
an as intermediate between the two. 



54 PLANTS AND ANIMALS. 

The second class of invertebrata are the Artictdata, or jointed-animals. They are 
vided into five orders, as follows r 1. Crustacea, crabs, lobsters, beetles ; 2. AracknidsBL 
spiders ; 3. Insecta, proper insects, having six legs, as bees, ants, etc ; 4^ Myriapoda or 
centipedes ; 5. Annellidans (ringed-animals), as worms, grubs, etc. 

Animals of this class are more simple in their stnictore than the Molnsca : their hiogi 
consist of mere tubes, and their circulating and nutritive organs are much simplified ; ^ 
some of them, especially the ant, bee, and spider, exhibit a remarkable degree of sagacitj. 

The third class of invertebrate animals, called Zoophytes or Badiaiaj Â£n^m the rayed or 
stellar form which many animals belonging^x^ it assume, has been lately subdivided into 
two classes. The first of these dasses is called Nemaloneura, from the circumstance tbat 
the animals belonging to it still possess a nervous system, though reduced to the foim 
of a mere simple thread. It includes five orders : 1. EchinodermatOj sea-urcfaine, etc, ia 
which the radiated form is very conspicuous ; 2. Epizoa, parasitic animals, living upon 
the exterior of other animals ; 3. Rotifera, wheel-animalcules, minute, roikting, micro- 
scopic animals, abounding in certain fluids ; 4. Bryozoa ; 5. CoelcemifUha, internal 
paxasitic animals found preying on the integuments of other animals, and so minute as 
usually to be seen only with a microscope. 

The other division of the Radiata is called Acriia. The creatures bdongidg to this di- 
vision, have no nervous system at all, and very limited powers of locomotion. Tli^ 
have, indeed, scarcely any of those functions which we are in the habit of considering as 
inseparable from vitality. They are divided into five orders : 1. SterelmhUha^ the diftr- 
ent species of which live exclusively in the alimentary canal, the Uver, the brain, and 
other parts of more highly organized animals ; 2. the AcalephcET, animals floating, ii 
swarms, on the ocean, ana exhibiting to the common observer the appearance of a lump 
of jelly, and no traces of that elaborate structure which ttiey really possess ; 3. the P^ 
gastrica (many-bellied), or infusorial animalcules, of which myriads may be found in 
every pool of dirty water, and which iticrease so rapidly by a process of subdivision, tliat 
from a sin^e animal as many as 270 millions may be produced in a month ; 4. the 
PolypSy including the cbral animalcules, whose labors in secreting and depositing carbo- 
nate of lime are permanently recorded in the crust of the earth, and which have, by thdr 
vast numbers and never-ceasing activity, actually formed a large proportion of the solid 
materials of the earth. The internal structure of these coral animals is so simple as to eoa- 
sist of little more than a stomach to separate from the sea-water a quantity of carbonate 
'of lime, with which they build their habitations ; 5. the Sponges, those animals, if in* 
deed they can be called animals, which give no indication oi any sensation, which )Â»ve 
no voluntary motion, which exhibit no internal receptacle for food, no apparatus for di- 
gestion, and in fact which only differ firom the soKd rock to which they are affixed, by the 
possession of canals, which communicate with one another and permeate the whole body, 
conveying the water which surrounds the mass, to all parts of the structure. 

The above classification of animals includes not only the existing but also the exlinei 
species, the discovery of which has given such a new interest and importance to the 
study of zoology. 

X. MAN 

1. Varieties of the Human Race. All men, whatever their varieiy in external appcÂ«<- 
ance or internal structure, are acknowedged by Naturalists, to constitute a single species, 
and even a single genus and order in the arrangement of animals. 

The test of a species is, the power of the individuals belonging to it mutually to jho- 
pagate their race indefinitely. Some species nearly allied to each ottier, are able to pie- 
duce between them, a hybrid or mixed race, as in the case of the mule, the offspring <rf 
the horse and ass. But these hybrids are barren, and have no power of continnii^ 
their race ; and thus it is, that species are prevented from intermixing with each ather} 
and so confusing the present oroer and arrangement of nature. 

Now men of every variety possess the power of continuing the human race in con- 
junction with individuals of any other variety ; and hence it is certain that there are no 
"Ic differences among man. At the same time there are some very obvious yuM^ 



MAN. SS 

fltmoiig the men found hthabitiBg vazioas parte of the globe ; and great disputes hav^ 
existed among naturalists, as to the causes, nature, and extent of those differences. 

One party nas been indined to represent these differences as very great, and has even 
sought to degrade some races of men into an alliance with apes and monkeys. This 
party has held that the existing varieties of the human species must have been perma- 
nent and original ; and that they are wholly inconsistent with the idea, tl)at all men or- . 
i^nally descended from one pair, or that one variety of the human race is capable, by 
ine operation of existing netoral cames, of being transformed, in the course of time, 
into any other variety. 

Another party, no less learned and zealous, have stickled for the natural equality and 
-iiiginal relationship of all branches of the human family, and have ascribed the differen- 
ces now existing, to the effect oÂ£ climate, food, mode of life, and other causes, which are 
inrell known to produce a remarkable efiect, not only upon manners, but upon external ap- 
pearance, and even internal organization. 

It is to be feared that this question has not always been discussed as a purelv scienti- 
fic question^ but too often, in a social point of view very likely to prejudice and mislead. 
Thus, some writers upon this subject, seem to have imagined, that if they could estab- 
lish the physical and mental superiority of one race over another, they established, at the 
same time, in that superior race, a sort of natural right to tyrannize over the inferior race, 
and even to reduce them to slavery. But this conclusion by no means seems to follow 
fitom the premises ; because weakness or inferiority ought certainly rather to be groundi 
for kindness and benevolent guideince, than for oppression or plunder. That one race 
has a right to oppress'others on account of their inferiority, is a doctrine which savors 
too mudi of barbarism, and is hardly fitted for these enlightened times. 

The alleged superiority of some races over others, has also been the foundation of 
laws enacted in many of iiiose coimtries, in which Wo or more races have come into 
contact, designed to keep those races distinct, on the ground that by this intermixture, 
the nobler race would be degraded and debased, and that an inferior population would 
thence result. It is to be observed however that these laws have always proved quite 
unavailing. In spite of the most strenuous efforts of legidators, two races never remain 
in contact without intermixture ; and this amalgamation becomes, with ev^ passing 
generation, more and more complete. It is this circumstance principally, which makes it 
so difficult to arrive at any satisfactory classification of the existing varieties of the 
human family. The most distinct and well marked varieties, whenever they come into 
contact, always intermix, and produce a vast number of intermediate varieties passing 
into each other by imperceptible gradations. On the other hand, the transfer of portions 
of one race to new countnes and climates, always ^ves rise to new varieties which ao- 
qmre a permanent character. Thus the children or Europeans born in America, called 
by the Spanish Creoles^ a distinguishing epithet which has been adopted in all the Euro- 
pean tropical colonies, have physical peculiarities by which they may be readily distiu'' 
guished from Europeans ; and the same is true of the children bom of English parents 
in the Australian colonies. 

The most striking differences in the varieties of the human race, are in the color and 
texture of the skin and hair. These however are varieties which are known to be easi- 
est produced. All the domestic animals, which are exposed like man to modifications 
of tfieir natural habits, the result of human intelligence, are liable to very great varia- 
tions of this sort, to which in general we ascribe very little imp(Â»rtance. It has been 
maintcdned by many, that the cmrk color and ouriy hair of the negroes are but a devia- 
tion from the original white ccdor, produced by heat and other peculiarities of climate. 
A celebrated writer upon tins subjed;. Dr. Pritclmrd, has lately started an opposite theory, 
that the original color was dark, and that the light-colored races are deviations from the 
original type. 

But it is not in external appearance only, that races difier from each other. * There Â« 
are varieties in the shape and proportions of the skeleton, and especially of the skull, to 
which naturalists have been inclined to ascribe a much greater importance. But even 
variations of this sort, may be, and are produced by well known natural causes. 
There is a degeneration, in theee respects, among tiie underfed and overworked classes

of society, which tends constantly to beocnne permanent ; and on the otiier hand, tnf- 
ficient and nutritive food and agreeable exerdse, may affect the physical constitatira 
not only of individual^ but of races. 

In point of fact, we do not yet possess any such distinct knowledge of the nmidier, 
extent and history of the varieties of the human species, as are absolutely requisite to- 
wards forming any specific opinion as to their cause. The commonly receiv^ diriaioK 
into five varieties, was made in the very infancy of the study of this subject, and ia by 
no means adequate to express what is now actually known of the subject 

On the continent of America, there are two well marked varieties ; Ist, the Esqui- 
maux, in the polar regions ; 2nd, the Indians, so called, a race with many sub-varieties, 
originally inhabiting all the rest of the continent. The eastern continent presents not 
less than six very distinct varieties, viz : 1st, the people under the arctic cirde, who have 
many peculiarities, and who seem to have been driven in very ancient times, by B^onga 
tribes into that last retreat ; 2nd, the Indo-Gtermanic, or Caucasian race, includiii^ the 
Europeans generally, the Arabs, the Persians, the Turks and the Hindus. 'Within the 
period of history a good deal of Mongol blood has been diffused among this race, and it 
IS probable that among the Hindus especially, there has been much intermixture of oth- 
er races. All the celebrated nations of antiquity, the Persians, Egyptians, Cartbagin- 
ians, Greeks and Romans, as well as those of modern times, belong to ihis race, iKrhich 
either from natural superiority, or from more favorable circumstances, or from bodi 
united, has far surpassed the other varieties in the career of civilization. 3d. The Mon- 
gols, including the Chinese, Japanese, and generally the people of eastern Asia. Ws 
variety, though quite stationary at present, has, in times past, made great progress in att 
and improvement. It embraces a very large portion of the human family. 5tb. The 
Berbers, a collective name given to the inhabitants of northern Africa, who with great 
differences among themselves, are yet distinguishable both from tiie Arabs who have in- 
vaded and conquered that region, and their southern neighbors, the negroes. 6th. 'Hie 
Negroes, the inhabitants of western Afirica, under the equator, between the great nortlH 
em and southern deserts of that continent. There are peculiarities in ti^e phyaiG&I 
character of that portion of the globe, which might be expected to act powarfnliy oo its 
inhabitants. But both this country, and the people who dwell in it, are yet very impe^ 
fecUy known. The sub-varieties among the Negroes, are very numerous and well mariced. 
7th. The Caffires or Hottentots, inhabiting the south-eastern portion of Africa, and 
separated from the Negroes by the great southern desert of that continent These peo- 
ple have long, straight hair, and, on the whole, are very different from the Negroes, but 
they and their country are even less known. The great district called Ooeanica, presents 
at least two varieties. 1st. The Papuans or Oriental Negroes, to which class belong 
the inhabitants of New HoUaud, of Papua or New Guinea, and the neighboring isl- 
ands, and also of the interior of Borneo, Celebes and all of that group. 2nd. The Ma- 
lays, who inhabit the coasts of the Malayan peninsula and the neighboring islands, urf 
who are considered to include the inhabitants of the western groups of Polynesia, tbough 
thid classification is not very satisfactory. * 

Thus we have no less than ten well marked varieties, to which we ought to add three 
more, which have arisen within the last three centuries, from an intermixture of races, 
which within that period, has taken place in America. These are Ist, the Mnhitloes, 
with a vast number of sub-varieties springing from the intermixture of the Negroes wiA 
the whites. 2nd, the Mestizoes, also with many sub-varieties, from the intermixture cf 
the whites with the aboriginal Americans ; and 3d, The Zambos, from the int ermixtu re 
of the Negroes with the Indians. These mixed races constitute a large proportion of 
the inhabitants of all that portion of America south of the United States ; and even ia 
the United States, they are not few. From the known history of tiiese tiiree races iiÂ« 
may form conjectures as to the origin of others, of whose history we know nothing. 

Though distinctions of race have often been a ground of hostility, they cue by ao 
means sufficient to serve as a bond of union. In tUs respect they are even inferior to 
community of Language, which serves to bind together even the most diverse raees; 

2. Language. It is only within a verv recent period that the subject of Language faai 
been studied in a spirit at all comprebettsive. The notion long prevalent among tiia

leAmed^ that the Hebrew wm the dldest of langaages, and indeed that all other Ian- 
^OMes were derived from it. Modem researches have shown that there is no ground 
for wis opinion* Even in that variety of the human family (the Caucasian) to which the 
Hebrews belong, only one, and that the smaller section of the race, to wit, the Arabs and 
Syrians, q)eak languages related to the Hebrew. The modem Arabic is the present rep- 
resentative of. these languages, wlj^ch were originally written without vowels. All the 
other great nations of the Caucasian race, spoke and still speak, languages of which the 
Sanscrit, the sacred language of the Hindu Bramins, appears to be the oldest existing 
lype. Remarkable analogies to the Sanscrit, showing a common origin, have been traced 
through the Greek, Latin, Persian, Sclavonic, German, and all the languages derived 
Â£rom them. Whether the Celtic languages belcHig to tiiis class is doubtful. 

The Mongolian variety of men have too, among themselves, a variety of languages. 
The northern Tartars, the conquerors at times of Persia, Bussia, India, and China, have 
a written language wholly different from the monosyllabic language of the Chinese. 

With respect to the languages spoken by the oth^ great varieties of the human famOy, 
'we know but littie. Indeed, far the greater part of them have never been reduced to 
'writing, and are known onlv to a limited number of individuals. In savage and barba- 
rous states of society, there is a great tendency to the multiplication of languages. Every 
claa, or small district, has its particular dialect; and these dialects grow more and more 
diverse. Those languages which have become most famous as vehicles of thought, in 
"which the most famous works have been written, and which have been spoken in the most 
uniform way, ov^ the greatest tracts of country, seem to have been originally the dialect of 
8<Hne single city, used by some popular authors, and which thence came to be looked up 
to as a imniel, and to be studied and imitated by all who aimed at elegance, or claimed 
to be educated. Thus the Ghreek language, in the form in which it was written and spoken 
for more than fifteen hundred years, being spread through the then known world by the 
colonizing and enterprising character of the Greeks, or Uie conquests of Alexander, was 
derived from the city of Athens, where many famous authors Uved, by whose auth<Mrity 
the language became fix^ and settied, the various dialects which bad prevailed in for- 
mer times beinff superseded by the Attic So Latin was originall the language of the 
cify of Rome, diffused by coQquest, first over Italy, and then over the whole of west^n 
Europe. The written Italian was the dialect of Florence ; French, originally, was the 
dialect of Paris ; and English, the dialect of London. Throughout America, whither tte 
Elfish was brought after it became a written language, it is spoken with much greater 
uniformity and purity than by the lower orders of me English themselves, who use a va- 
ri^ of local dialects, many of which are hardly inteUigiUe to a stranger. 

Those languages which contain the richest and most valuable records of the history, 
the thoughts, and researches of man, are: 1. the Ghreek, 2, tiie Latin, 3. the Arabic, 4 the 
Italian, 5. the French, 6. the English, 7. the G^erman. The Greek and Latin are no 
longer spoken as vernacular tongues ; tiie modern Greek being hardly so much Uke the 
ancient as the Italian is like *the Latin. The Latin language continued, throughout Eo^ 
rope, to be the language of learned men, in which all scientific treatises were written, till 
within about two hundred years ; and it is still used, to a certain extent, for that pur- 
pose. Down to the period named, the ccNcrespondence of the learned, and all diplomatic 
cooespondence, was carried on in Latin. Some of the most celebrated of modern works, 
such as Bacon's Novum Orgammiy Milton's Defence of the English People^ for the exeÂ« 
cation of Charles L, and Newton's Principia^ were originally published in Latin. All the 
piofeBsions made great use of it, and most professional treatises were written in it. We 
can (bus easily understand how the knowledge of Latin has so long been considered an 
essential sten towards a liberal education. Latin is still the language of tiie Catholic 
church ; and fSreek, of the Greek ehurch ; in which prayers are said, and public worship 
performed. 

The Saracens, after the esteblishment of the splendid empire of the Caliphs, while Eu- 
rope was everrun with' barbarous tribes from the north and east, and sinking every day 
into ignorance, caught up the torch of science and translated into Arabic many woru 
from &e Greek, especially those on mathematics and other scientific subjects, several of 
which are known at present only through the medium of th^e translations. No incon-

The modern languages of Europe, at first employed only in ballads and romantieThjnei, 
and scorned by the learned, have in process of time been so much enridied, simplified, ad 
improved, that, in point of copiousness and exactness of expression, though notperhapiiD 
harmony, they now surpass the ancient tongues. Tbf Scdian and Spa/iMky intertoixtam 
of the Gothic with the Latin, were the first of these languages which were carried to |Â»> 
fection. The Italian, especially, was first used for scientific purposes ; bat free inqnry 
was suppressed, in Italv and Spain, by the inquisition. At present, we may consider the 
English, French, and Cferman as the three languages in which the wide-spread researebes 
and almost daily discoveries of modem science are principcdly puUished, and the knov^ 
ledge of which is most useful and essential. These languages are all closely rdated to 
each other, the French being a mixture of the old German with the Latin, and the Eig> 
lish a mixture of the old German with the French. The Eng^h, which, two bandiHl 
years ago, was spoken only by about four ot five fnillions of persons in the island of Gmt 
Britain, is now rapidly spreading all round the glob6. It is the language of tiie fas^ 
Increasing population of North America, where it has become the mothep-tongue of the 
transplanted Africans, and is beginning to be acquired and used by the more civilized 
portion of the Indians. It prevails in the West Indies, and is spoken on the conliiMiit 
of South America. It has been planted all along the west coast of Africa, and at the 
Cape of Good Hope. In the neat empire of Indostan, the English is the official hn- 
guage of the government, and nom that circumstance among others, it is rapidly sfRcad* 
ing among the people. English colonists have carried it to Australia and New Zeahiid, 
and it seems likely to become the language of the Pacifia It is much to be regretted 
that a language otherwise so simple and so easily acquired, should be oppressed widi an 
orthography so arbitrary and irregular, and which fails so totally to express the sound. 
Lfi this respect the English and French are quite peculiar. Unfortunately the cxthogn- 
phy of these languages was settled long before the pronuncia^on was Â£xed, and with 
less regard to the actual sounds of these languages as spoken, than to the cnrthographj 
of the ancient languages from which they are derived. It is to be hoped that this gied 
defect may yet be remfedied. 

The Dutch, Flemish, Danish, and Swedish are intermediate between the German and 
English ; the Portuguese is but a dialect of the Spanish. The HungaHan is a very peco- 
liar dialects, brought, by the predecessors of the present inhabitants of Hungary, fer from 
the East. In all the eastern part of Europe, the Slavonian language is spoken in varioos 
dialects, of which the Polish, Russian, and Bohemian are the most noted. The SoÂ»* 
sian language is only now beginning to be cultivated. The Celtic, of which there are 
several ebcisting dialects, as the Welsh, Gaelic, Irish, Breton, etc., was the language of 4e 
Celts, the ancient inhabitants of Western Europe, who were first conquered by the Bo- 
mans, and then displaced by the barbarous invaders from the east and north-east, by 
whom the Roman empire was overturned. In the mountains of Spain and in the extenc 
north, are found singular and peculiar dialects, the Basque and the Finnish, the only re- 
maining record of tribes almost extinct, who once ]>^ap6 might have possessed the 
greater part of Europe. 

CJreat expectations were, for a time, entertained of the literary treasures which it wis 
supposed would be found in the Sanscrit, which first became known in Europe aboottbe 
end of the last century. These expectations have been, in a great measure, disafqp<nnted. 
This language contains no histoncal works whatever ; so that we are left to iafcreiice 
and conjecture as to the history of the nations by whom it was spoken. It abooads Ib 
poems founded on the extravagant mythology of the Hindus, and contains sotee rhymed 
treatises on mathematics, astronomy, and metaphysics. The ancient langua^ called 
Zend, preserved only in some fragments of the Zendavesta or sacred books of wt Mari* 
ans ; and the Pali, in which the sacred books of the Boodhists are written, are doedj 
related to the Sanscrit. The existing languages of Hindostan, the ERndostanee, Bengtke, 
etc., produced by the intermixture of nations in that peninsula, are more or lew rdtted 
to the Sanscrit They contain no writings of any value, and it is to be hoped they wffl

me day be snperseded by the EngUsh. The Persian and Turkish are also modem lan- 
guages. They contain some historical writings ; and the Persian, especially, some poems 
tf celebrity. The Chinese have a great many books, which as yet are but little known. 
3ome valuable historical information has been derived, and more may be, from their an- 
lals, which ran back to a very distant period ; though it is only for the last thousand 
rears that they appear to possess any great degree of authenticity. The peculiar method 
^f writing adopted by the Chinese, appears to have acted as a great clog upon their sci- 
entific progress. 

A universal langnage has been a subject which has, at times, employed the thoughts 
rf the scientific. It wotdd certainly be a vast benefit. The predominancy and general dif- 
asion which a few tongues, as the Chinese, Arabic, English, French, German, and Span- 
sh have attained, constitute a degree of progress towards it Yet still it remains to be 
freatly regretted that so much time and labor have to be spent, not in the study of science 
mt in acquiring languages, which are mere instruments of science. 

3, Religions. â€” A stifl stronger bond among nations even than community of lanraage 
s identity of Helicon. Groups of nations are formed on the ground of this resemblance, 
rhus we speak of Ohristendchn as including all the nations which profess the Christian 
eligion. The Mohammedan nations constitute another group, bound together, to a certain 
extent, by a religious tie. 

Rel^ons may be divided into two classes: 1. DocwmewtofyJJe/^OTW, those which pos- 
iess written documents to ^vi^hich a sacred character is ascribed, and which contain the 
loctrines and ceremonies of the religion ; and % TtaditioncMry Religions^ those without 
iny such documents, their doctrines and ceremonies being transmitted by tradition, 
hrough an order of priests. The great efficacy of written documents is strongly evinced 
n the superior permanency of those religions that possess them. Thus the religions of 
3reece, Rome, jEgypt, and Carthage, the religion of the Druids, which prevailed amone 
he Celts, and the Gothic religion, as well as the elaborate systems of the Mexicans and 
Peruvians, have totally ceased from off the earth. This is a fate which is not known to 
lave happened to any religion possessing sacred books. The Jewish religion, though ex- 
>osed to the most barbarous persecutions, still flourishes in fiill vigor ; the Magian re* 
igion still has its adherents, who look up with reverence to the books of Zoroaster ; the 
sSohammedans were unable to suppress the Hindu faith founded on the Vedas ; the ffin- 
lus were equally unable to suppress the Boodhists, who have their Bedagat or collection 
>f sacred writings. The Christian and Mohammedan religions, both of which have had 
heir ori^ within the period of history, have swallowed up and superseded a vast number 
>f traditionary religions, and are still daily spreading. Mohammedanism is gradually dif- 
using itself d^ough the whole interior of Africa ; the zeal of the Christians sends mis- 
sionaries to every part of the world, but with much the most success among those peo- 
>le who have no sacred books of their own. Boodhism appears originally to have been 
ipread in the same way. It has penetrated through Chin-India, China, and Tartary, 
ind its further spread seems only to be restrained by the fact that it has swallowed 
ip all the merely traditionary reUgions within its reach. One or the other of four re- 
igions, the Christian^ Mohammedan^ Boodhist^ or IRndUj now prevails, in some form 
>r other, among cdl those nations which have made any advance beyond the savage 
(tate. 

It unfortunately happens that while Documentary religions possess so great a de- 
cree of permanency, they have been equally remarkable for intx)lerance and a spirit of 
)ersecution. Thus between Christians ana Mohammedans, Mohammedans andHinduS| 
Hindus and Boodhists, and between the Jews and all the rest, there have existed, and 
itiU to a c^Hain extent exist, standing quarrels which have lasted for ages, and have led, 
it times, to terrible outbreaks of rage and cruelty. But the evil has extended even further. 
Bach religion has become divided mto hostile portions. Thus the Christian religion spliti 
centuries ago, into the Roman, Greek, Syriac and Coptic churches, which excommuni- 
Â»ted each other. The Roman church has divided into Catholics and Protestants ; and 
he Protestants have separated into a constantiy increasing multiplicity of sects. This 
endency to division seems to grow in proportion as science and the spirit of inquiry ad-

ing, in one common social union, the greatest diversities of race, lapgnage, and rdigiis

into one people, mutual antipathies can no longer be played off against each other, vi 
the nation thus be kept subject to an absolute master. Hence proceeds, fi^radoallybit 
inevitably, a modification in the form of government, over which public opinion aiidlk 
common interest of the whole rthe people now, for the first time, having become capable 
of the idea of common interest) exercise a continually increasing influence. 

5. Progress of Enlightenment. â€” But it is to the progress of enlightenment that we an 
to look for the great bond of union and combination, bringing together all the nations of 
the earth, whatever their race, language, religion, or form of government, into one coo- 
mon brotherhood, all striving together for the advancement of the welfare of the whdt 
We may notice, in the different portions of the earth, that the spirit of isolation is great- 
est in the rudest conditions of society ; and that the circle of sympathy grows wider and 
wider as knowledge progresses. 1. In the Savage statej in which hunting and fishio; 
are principally relied upon as a means of support, mankind necessarily roam over a greit 
surface, divided into petty clans. These clans firequentiy quarrel about hunting-grouod! 
and fishing-stations, and carry on against each other almost a perpetual war. 2. In the 
Pastoral state^ in which flocks and herds form the great source of subsistence, the nnmba 
of men multiplies with the increase of food, and communities become larger. Bat tber 
wander here and there, without any fixed place of abode ; and the expectation of pluih 
der makes them more warlike even than the savage. 3. The Agricultural state first leads 
to fixed habitetions ; but unfortunately it almost always has introduced, or rather greattj 
extended, the practice of slavery, by which a large part of mankind is reduced to a hop^ 
less and stationary condition, and cut off firom the benefits of advancing civilizadoa 
4. The rise and progress of manufactures and commercCj while tending greatiy to increase 
the wealth and comfort of a community, tends also towards the aboUtion of slavery. It 
is by this means .that servitude, in the process of centuries, has disappeared from western 
Europe. 6. After agriculture, manufactures and commerce have made a certain degree of 
progress, and so much wealth has accumulated that there begins to exist a class who 
have leisure and curiosity. Science^ properly so called, the investigation of the order and 
relations of the various phenomena which take place around us, first has its rise. The 
discoveries of science are capable of being constantiy applied to the advancement of thf 
arts. But from a combination of influences, which we have nbt room here to ^numerate, 
the progress of science is liable constantiy to be arrested. Men entertain such a wonder 
and veneration for the discoveries of their ancestors, that they think it almost sacrilegoiB 
to supersede them by discoveries of their own. This is the origin of a very marked divi- 
sion, to be observed among the communities existing onjthe globe, into 1. Stationary nal^^ 
in which tradition holds the place of inquiry, and which rather retrograde thaa advance: 
and, 2. Progressive nationSy those in which science is cultivated, and which, under its in* 
fluence, are constentiy moving forward. The great influence of the progress of science upofl 
the advancement of the arts, has been most strikingly illustrated in the history of the last 
two centuries, during which, among the progressive nations, the arts have advanced with 
a constantiv accumulating and unparalleled rapidity. The tie of science, of the cominon 
pursuit of knowledge, has been found capable of overcoming the strongest antipathies. 



PB0QRBS8 OF BNUOHTENMENT. 



<Â» 



Thasi during the middle ages, wiiilethe Christiasn and Mohammedans earned on the mott 
farious hoetilities, the scientific men of both rdigions respected and loved each other; 
ami during the wars of modem Europe, the literary and scientific men of hostile nations 
ha^e not ceased to regard each other as brothers. Bat this is not alL The merchants 
and traders, natnraliy enongli, perhaps, early took np the notion that buyers could only 
grow rich by getting an advantage of the sellers ; and that sellers could only profit and 
grow rich by gradually drawing away the wealth of the buyers. This notion, which long 
prevailed, exercised a most pernicious influence, and led to great sharpness, narrowness, 
and selfishness, in the transactions not only of individuals, but of nations ; as though 
w^Edth were a thing to be scrambled for and to be attained by some, only fiN>m the loss 
<rf others. Modem science has most conclusively shown that however true this may be 
in individual instances, in the long run and as affiled to communities it is totally false ; 
that the prosperity of the sellers is dependent on the prosperity of the buyers ; and that 
the buyers must sufier, in their turn, firom any permanent injuiy to the sellers. This view 
has given a vast increase of liberality and beneficence to the ideas of commerce. At the 
mme time it has become evident that war, hitherto as it were the cpreat occupation of the 
nations, is inconsistent, not only with humanity, but with all social progress. Hence that 
indisposition to war, at least with each other, by which the great civilized nations, during 
the last generation, have become distinguishea ; hence in spite of all the nmnerous ob* 
stades stfll existing, the obvious progress daily making in that view which regards all the 
members of the human race as belonging to one great family, with common interest to 
be subserved, and a common happiness to be promoted. Such views are by no means 
foreign to a treatise upon universal Geography ; since the first step towards looking upon 
men as brothers is to know who they are, and where and how they live.

TO 

GOODRICH'S PICTORIAL GEOGRAPHY. 

PART FIRST. 



THE OLD WORLD. 

L WHAT WE CALL THE OLD WORLD. 

We desi^ate aa the Old World the three Continents of the Eastern Hemispbn. 
Earope, Asia, and Africa, together with the islands adjacent to theii shores, and nsuBi 
reckoned a part of them, induding with Europe, Iceland and the British Islands; wd 
Airica, Madagascar ; and with Asia, the islands of Japan ; but excluding all islands somk 
of the Straits of Malacca and west of the China Sea, wluch we set down as a pan 
of Oceanica, and as such belonging to the New World. 

This name of Old World, is not employed in any geological sense, as implying u? 
older existence on the part of these regions, which is so far from being the case, thit i 
large portion at least of Europe, which alone has been critically examined by geologist 
consists of formations which give evidence of being among those most recently elerawd 
from beneath the surface of the sea. We merely imply by it, that civilization is of ea^ 
lier date on these continents, and that our historical knowledge of them runs back to i 
more ancient period. But the application even in this sense of the phrase Old Wodi 
to the entire extent of these continents, must be understood with some liimtatioia 
Egypt and Mesopotamia are the countries which, in this historical point of view, mayl* 
esteemed the oldest; next come Syria, the coasts of Asiatic Turkey, Greece, Italy,*â„¢ 
the shores of the Mediterranean generally. China, separated by vast distances and in- 
habited by men of a very different race, may boast a nearly equal historical antiquitj' 
Persia begins to appear about the same time on the historical horizon. The position of 
India, in this respect, is rather equivocal ; for although that country exhibits in ita Ufr 
guages, and especially in the Sanscrit, evidences of a very high antiquity, it never W 
any native historians, and its historicsJ annals do not go beyond the invasion of Aw- 
ander the Great The north of Europe, and especially the north-west, the vast intfritr 
table-lands of Asia, and the great region of Siberia, are comparatively modem. I*' 
part of the African coast south of the Great Desert, only became known about the tifflf 
of the discovery of America, while the greater part of its interior still remains nnkiiow 
and unexplored. 

As, at present, Europe far predominates over her two sister continents in weaWi ** 
sodal importance, we shall begin our account of ike Old World, with her.

British Islands (including Guernsey, etc,) 27,600,000 inhabitants. 

Denmaik (including IceUmd), 1,800,000 ^

in any division of the world. If the United States were as thickly settled as Europe, 
they would have a population of 180,000,000 inhabitants ; and not less than 800,000,000, 
if the proportion were like that of Holland and Bdgium, where the population is 306 to

Enrope presents a coast-line of nearly 15,000 miles in length. 

PemfwwAw.â€” From the manner in which the -European continent is penetrated by the 
ocean, its outline presents a number of peninsulas, to which there is no parallel in the 
world. The largest of these is the Scandinavian Peninsula, comprising Norway, Sw^ 
den, and Lapland. Next follow the three great peninsulas of Western Europe : the Span- 
ish, which includes Spain, Portugal, and the Republic of Andorra ; the Italian, so remark* 
able for its odd form, being shaped like a boot ; and the Grecian, not less remarkable fcir& 
number of secondary pemnsulas which its outline ^presents. The M orea, forming the 
southern portion of toe latter, alike famous in ancient and modem history, and the Mao^ 
donian, the northern portion of the same, which is itself divided into three other peninsnias 
â€” those of Monte-Santo, Toron, and Cassandra, are occupied chiefly by the modem 
kingdom of Greece. The other principal European peninsulas are the Cmnea, South- 
em Russia ; Kanin, in the government of Archangel ; Jutland, in the north of Germany; 
and a peninsula which comprehends the province of Holland and Utrecht, which maybe 
termed the Netherlandish. We may also remark that the three departments of Finisteire, 
Morbihan, and Cot6s du Nord, form a peninsula in the north-west of France. 

Climate. The climate is generally, in the western parts, much warmer than in the 
same parallels in America and Asia. The difference is equivalent to eight or ten de- 
igrees of latitude. This may be accounted for by the currents of warm air and water 
which, coming from the GFulf of Mexico and flowing north-easterly, set constantij 
upon the western and northern coasts. 

In order to exhibit, in a definite shape, the distribution of heat in the same latitndes, 
and in each season, we take the following table from Humboldt, Ann. de PhUos. {d 
188.) : 



Places. Mean of Year. Winter. lining. Summer. A 

Edinboi^li, (lat 56,) 47.5 88.6 46.4 58.2 48.4. 

Copenhagen, ( Â« ) 46.6 80.8 41.2 62.6 48-4. 

Moscow, ( Â« ) 40.2 10.8 44.0 67.1 S8.8. 

The warmest month at Edinburgh had a mean temperature of 59.4, and tiie coldest 
38.3 ; at Copenhagen, 65.0 and 27.1, and at Moscow, 70.6 and 6.0 respectively. Thnsit 
will be perceived that the heat of summer in the more inland or easterly countries is 
much greater than in those on the seaboard of the west, and vice versa in regard to the 
winter months. 

The hottest part of Europe is its south-western extremity^ The south of Europe, 
protected by the great ranges of the Alps from the north and east winds, has generally a 
warm climate, but being also open to the winds from Africa, sometimes suffers from tiie 
influence of the sirocco. Humidity characterizes the climate of western Europe. In 
respect to the duration of the seasons, Europe may be divided into three zones. Soiitb* 
ward of 45 deg. the winter is mostly confined to rainy weather from October to F^bni- 
ary ; snow rarely falls, and vegetation is scarcely impeded. The spring lasts from Feb- 
ruary to April or May ; and the summer, during which the thennometer frequently iiiaita 
107 deg., and the autumn, divide the remainder of the year. Between 45 d^. aod

The quantity of rain that falls depends moch on locality, but as a ) 
Tiore eqnatoriai the country, the greater is the degree of humidity. A 
len, the annual fall is only 16.92 inches ; and at St. Petersburg, l8.)l ; while at Carsag- 
lana, in Spain, it amounts to 98.07 inches. The difference in England alone is enor- 
nous ; at London, 22.7 falls annually ; while at Keswick the annual measurement i6 67 
nches. In the mountain regions of Switzerland, the annual rains measure 51 inches ; 
Dut in France and Central Europe, and in the northern parts of Italy, the mean rains 
imount only to from 21 to 35 iaches. 

4. Surface. From the mouth of the Rhine, an inamense plain embraces Holland, the 
:iorth of Germany, the provinces of West and Â£ast Prussia, Poland, and Russia, to the 
Ural mountains ; of which the highest elevation, near the sources of the Volga, Dnieper, 
ind Don, is only 1,064 feet Other plains of smaller extent are to be found in Hungary, 
Wallachia, Lombardy, France, etc. The raountainouB regions of the European conti- 
Ficnt, occupy together an area of about 979,800 square miles. The most rema^ahle 
monntain langes of Europe are the following : 

1. The Alps, the principal chain of mountains in Europe, occupying an area of neat- 
ly 74,550 square miles, run liom the coast of the Mediterranean sea, at the boundary 
between Frant^ and Italy, through Savoy, Switzerland, Tyrol, and other provinces of 
Aixsttia, to the western parts of Turkey, at a distance of about 550 miles. Several poi- 
rions of them have particular names, as. Maritime Alps, nearest to the coast ; Cottian 
A.lp8, between France and Savoy; Gray Alps, between Savoy and Piedmont; Pennine 
Alps J Leponttne Alps, etc. The highest peaks of the Aljps, are : Mont Blanc, in Savoy, 
15,663 feet high; Mount Rosa, in Savoy, but neat the frontier of Switzerland, 15,5^ 
feet ; Finsteraarhorn, in Switzerland, 1^325 feet ; Pelvoux de Vallouise, on the French 
territory, 14,044 feet; Jungfrau, 13,730 feet; Schreckhorn, 13,310 feet, in Switzerland; 
Ortlea, in Tyrol, 13,065 feet ; Watzmann, in Bavaria, 9,150 feet ; and Tergloo, in CaHn- 
ihaÂ« 10,194 feet high. The monastery of St Bernard is situated in ouc of the high 
passes of the Alps, and is occupied by monks devoted to the rescue and assistance of 
travellers, often in danger of perishing in the snow. 

2. The Pyrenees separate France from Spain, running in an almost westerly direction 
from the coast of the Mediterranean sea, to that of the bay of Biscay. The highest peaks 
of this mountain range, are : the Maladetta, 11,436 feet nigh ; Mont Perdu, 10,482 feet ; 
and Pico Las Posets, 10,584 feet, on the Spanish side, and the Marhore, 10,374 feet; 
Vi^nemale, 10,350 feet ; Piclong 9,972 feet ; and Canijou, 8,800 feet high, on the French 
aide. 

3. The Sierra Nevada, the principal mountain range of Spain, covers chiefly that part 
of the country commonly called Upper Andalusia, or the province of Granada. Its 
highest peaks are the Cumhre de Mulhacen, 11,678 feet, and Picaeho dc Veleta, 11,^00 
feet. One branch of the Sierra Nevada, runs in the direction of Cadiz, and ends in 
cape Trafalgar. Parallel with the Sierra Nevada, and in the direction of Algrave (the 
noathem province of Portugal,) runs the Siwra Morena, which, in Portugal, bears the 
name of Sierra Monchique. 

4. The Apennines skirt the gulf of Genoa, and run south-east to the south extremity 
of Italy. They bear particular names, according to their local position. Ligurian Ap- 
enoiBes, Etruscan Apennines, Roman Apennines, Neapolitan Apennines, and Abruzzi, 
in tiie northern part of the kingdom of Naples. The highest part is the Grran Sasso d' 
Italia, in Naples, 9,577 feet high ; othei parts are from six to seven thousand feet. The 
volcano Mount Vesuvios, near Naples, u 3,932 feet high. On the island of Sicily, be-

Galicia, ran in a sonth-easterly dirKtiw 

. from the sources of the Oder riÂ»er toth 
Danube. The highest peaks are the Rb-

â–  7. The Balkan or Haemns, rnnning east through the midst of Turkey, rises to tic 
height of 10,000 feet in the Tchar Dag, its highest summit. Its general height is 8P 
feet The Mezzovo ridge, running southerly (the ancient Pindus), has one suminit d 
9,000 feet Mount Lacha (anciently Olympm), according to a recent measurement, Â£ 
9,754 feet, Mount Kisaok {Ossa), 6,407, and Mount Zagora (PeKtm), 5,310. 

8. In France there are, besides the Pyrenees, the Jura Moantains between France aif 
Switzerland, from 4,000 to 5,000 feet high; the Sevennes, commencing near the east etd 
of the Pyrenees, and running north, forming the dividing ridge between the valleya of fc 
Rhone and Loire; the mountains of Atjvergne, branching from the Sevennes andnn- 
ning north-west ^s the dividing ridge between the valleys of the Loire and the GaiooK; 
the Vosges, running parallel with the Rhine, between the provinces of Lorraine and it 
Bace ; the Cote d'Or, in the province of Burgundy, and Morwan Moantains, on the Wgl 
road between Paris and Lyons, and the Ardennes, running from the northern parh rf 
Champagne to Luxemburg. These last are woody hills rising to 1,800 feet ^^d psrtt' 
them are called the Argonnea. The highest of the other French mountains are frontSjIffl 
to 6,000 feet Puy-Musy is 6,113, and Plomb de Cantal 6,093. 

9. The highest mountain range in the north of Germany, called the Sudetic moanfeUBv 
passes along the southern frontier of Silesia, with different divisions and names. Tvt 
Suderic mountains proper form the boundary between Austrian Silesia and Mwaw 
with the Altvater 4,640 feet, and the Great Schneeberg or Snow peak, 4,400 feet higt 
The Riesengebirge, or Giants' mountains, form the boundary between Silesia and Bohe- 
mia ; the Luaatian mountains form the boundary between Lusatia and Bohemia. 

10. Other mountain ranges in Germany, are : the Boehmerwald, along the bonndstv 
between Bohemia and BaTaria, rising to 4,000 and 4,500 feet ; the Erzgebiig, or On 
mountains, the boundary between Bohemia and Saxony, which rise to 3,870 feet ; (If 
Fichtel Gebirge, in the north-east part of Bavaria, with the Schneeberg, 3,221 feet, and 
Ocbsenkopf, 3,123 feet ; the Black Forest, Schwarzwald, partly belonging to WurtembÂ«E. 
but chiefly occupying the southern part of Baden, and covered with gloomy pine ft*- 
est*, whence its name. The mean elevation is from 3,000 to 3,500 feet though the Pel* 
berg and Belchen, both in Baden, rise to 4,650 and 4,397 feet ; the Alps, (which have noth- 
ing in common with the Alps in Switxeriand and Italy,) in 'Wurtcmberg, commonly fsDri 
Swabian Alp, thence running north-east through Bavaria, by the name of Franconiw 
Alp; the Odenwald, branching from the Black Forest and running north through HÂ«Â« 
Darmstadt ; the Spessart between Aschaifenburg and Wurtzburg, in Bavaria, with tn 
elevation not exceeding 1,900 feet ^nd havii^ in its neighborhood the inferior range* of

md other mighty rivers have their sources here. The Ural and Caucasus Mountains be- 
ong to Asiatic Russia. 

Barren Tracts. â€” Although Europe presents no tract of any considerable extent that 
nay properly be called a desert, yet unfertile plains, for the most part sandy, occur in 
everal places^ These are known by the names of Utndes, in France ; steppes, in Russia ; 
TUivens, in Hungary, etc. The most extensive are found in Russia, which presents, 
mong many others, the steppe of Ryn, between the Volga and Oural ; the steppe of the 
iarai, between that river and the Don ; the steppe of Crimea, and the steppe of Petchon. 




68 GBNEEAL VIEW OF EUROPE. 

Next to the steppes of Riusia, the most nmaikable tracts of a aifoilar description occis 
in Norway and Sweden, especially in Norway, Lapland, and Wester Gottland. Thne 
are several in the Austrian dominions, especially in Hongary, where they are very eitw- 
sive. They occnr, also, in the neighborhood of Stade, Hanover, Lunenbnrg. and Zdl, in 
the kingdom of Hanover; at Hamborg, and in Pomerania in Prussia ; and tbey occnpj 
the greater portion of the snrface of the departments of the Landes and the Gvonde, ii 
France. Similar Iracts are foand in the Neapolitan province of Terra di Bari. These 
deserts are generally covered with heaths and a varieiy of unavailable raoaseo.

Lagnnes are numerous along the south coast ofthe Baltic, andsome parts of the Adri- 
atic shores ; and Holland is full of dykes and pools. The coasts of Norway and parts of 
Sweden abound with inlets of the sea, which often stretch a long distance inland ; these, 
however, do not consist of stagnant waters. Swamps occupy nearly the whole baain of 
the Pri^pec, in Poland, and along the courses of the Danube and Theiss, in Hungary, and 
at the mouths of the Danube, Po, and other rivers, they are extensive. Many of nunor 
extent are to be found in the great plain of the continent ; in the eastern parts of Kngland; 
in Touraine, in France ; in Italy (m particular the Pontine Marshes) ; in Sicily, in west- 
ern Greece, and on the shores of the Black Sea.

Jied, as the neceasitiea of man often force him to raiae corn under the most nnfavor- 
i)le circumstances. Gienerally, however, the parallel of 57 deg. or 58 deg. majkbe 
. egarded as the northern limit of the cultivation of wheat in Suope ; though in some 
ftvored spots in Finland it b raised as far north as 60 deg. or 61 deg. The hardier 
{rains, as lye, oats and barley, are cultivated in some sheltered sitoations on the coast 
>f Norway, as high as G0 deg. 30 min. ; but further east, in Rnsaia, their cultivation has 
lot been found practicable beyond 67 deg. Qr 68 deg. The introduction of jiotatoea from 
iie New World, which are now widely diiTused over almost every part of Europe, has 
been of peculia^ advantage to the northern re^ona, as they are said to be extremfdy pro- 
lific in i^nta where coin will hardly ripen. 

In ancient times nearly the whole surface of Europe was covered with dense forests. 
Tbeae, however, have in a great measure disappeared in the better cultivated and 
more popnlouacountries. Germany, Poland, Russia, Sweden, Norway, and some parts of 
the Austrian Empire, are at present almost the only parts of Europe which contain forests 
of any very great extent The natural orders of Amentacete and Conifers comprise 
the greatest namber of the noblest trees in the wooda of Northern and Central Europe. 
In these regions the oak is the lord of the forest, and often attains to an enormous size. 
It disappears about latitude 60 deg. ; the ash fails at 62 deg. ; the beach and lime are sel- 
dom found farther north than 63 deg.; or furs and pines beyond 70 deg. The tree that 
grows in the highest latitude ia the dwarf birch, and the last plant met with towards the 
pole, in Europe, ia considered to be the "red snow," (Falmetta nivalis,) a cryptogamic 
species. It must not, however, be supposed ihat the vegetation of Northern Europe is 
confined to those regions. On the Alps, the Pyrenees, and other mountain ranges, simi- 
lar products are met with at various elevations, the temperature of which corresponds to 
tliat required by the individual ; and on the declivity of .Â£tna, at di^erent heights, the 
flora of the torrid zone, and that of the Arctic Circle, are both met with. Bnt a marked 
diflerence from that of the rest of Enrope takes place in the vegetation south of latitude 
44 deg. The mountains there are covered with chestnut wooda ; everOTcens take the 
place of oaks, and the maritime and stone pinea of other coniferie. The plane-tree, 
flowering-ash, carob, laurels, lentiske, oleanders, cistus, and a host of dyeing, medical,

with a carpet of brilliant and odorous (lowers. 

Wild Animals. The animal kingdom in Europe is leaa varied than the vegetable. Ac- 
cording to Cavier the total Tinm- 
ber of species of he mammalia 
inhabiting this portion of the 
earth, is only about 150, and of 
this number only 68 are pecu- 
liar to Europe. The most for- 
midable animals are the white 
bear, confined to the polar re- 
L gions; the brown bear, once 
' common throughout the conti- 
nent, which now inhabits the 
Alps, Pyrenees, and other re- 
mote mountainous and wooded 
countries; the wolf and the wiM 
boar. The largest animals, (ex- 
clusive of the whale, walrus, 
etc., which inhabit the norlb- 
em seas,) are the elk and rein- 
deer, the latter of which is used 
t'ox Catching Cralw. aSE beast of burden in thenorth.

in central Europe to the red deer and roebuck, and these again in the Alpine regions to 
the chamois and ibes. The other principal wild animals are the lynx, met with chiefly 
in the south ; the wild-cat, fox, martin, otter, beaver, pole-cat, glutton, porcupine, hedge- 
hog, various kinds of weaseb, squirrels, haree, rabbits, rats, mice, etc 



Domeslicaied Animals. The domestic animals deserve more notice. The black cattle 
of Europe have attained to the highest perfection. The sheep is universally difliised. 
The chief races at present existing, are the Spanish " merino," Cretan, Wallachian and 
English. The merinos are most celebrated for their wool, but taken altogether the Eng' 
li^h are the most valuable. Goata are also very numerous, and the domestic hog, evident- 
ly descended from the ancient European wild boar, is omnipieaent. The horses of Eu-

rope are muivalled in speed, strength 
and coarage. Some naturalists sop- 
pose them to be of Tartax breed, bnl 
tiiere is no proof of such origin. Tbt 
English heavy horses are nneqnallcd 
for draught, and the race-borses for 
speed and bottom. The latter, and the 
hunters, have been crossed ^pith Aiab 
horses, the first of which was imported 
so late as the reign of James L The 
ass of southern Europe is a fine aod 
noble animal, but degenerates sadly is 
more northern latitudes. It is madi 
valued for the breeding of mules, the 
sure-footed nes& and hardiness of whid 
render thefti highly asefol. The do- 
mestic cat seems to be a lineal de- 
scendant of the wild species. 

Birds. The bird tribe is much more 
varied than that of quadrupeds. Ai 
many as 400 difierent species bave been 
enumerated; but many of these aretnlj 
birds of passage, and are indigenous to 
other lands. Four species of TnltDie 
inhabit the Alpine ranges, but uc 
seldom seen in the higher Jatitodea 
In the rocky and mountainous parte 
of the north their places are supplied 
by enormouseagles, falcons, large owb, 
k and other birds of prey. Most of Ik 
birds of the Arctic region are aquatic. 
\ In the south there is a great inte^ 
* mixture of the birds of Africa and 
1 Asia, as the Balearic crane, pelieu^ 
' flamingo, etc. The common sorts of 
game are generaUy diffused all ova 
Europe; but the red-grouse is cod- 
fined to Scotland, and is said to be 
the only species peculiar to Great 
Britain. Bustards abound in some 
parts of Turlcey and Greece. In 
generkl, European birds cannot boast 
of very brilliant plumage, but they 
excel all othera in melody. The pea- 
cock and the common domestic fowls 
have been introduced from the East, 
the turkey from the West 

Reptiles, Fislt, Insects. The ianii- 
ly of reptiles is not very numerotu. 
and few are either large or venomont. 
In the Mediterranean a very delicate 
epecies of turtle, (testvdo careOa) is 
found, and in some of the Austnan 
lakes, the proteus angvimts, a singu-

the principal lire the hening. cod, whiting, mackerel, haddock, midlet, anchovy and tun- 
ny in the ocean and seas ; and the salmon, trout, carp, perch, etc, in ffihh waters. Tha 
andiovy and tunny are almost confined to the Mediterranean, where their capture forms 
a valuable branch of industry. Crustacea are particularly numerous in the north, anii 
the mollusca in the south ; the latter are particularly abundant and various in the gulf 
of Taranto, anciently so famed for the mwex, afTordiag the Tyrian dye. 

In some parts of Europe, scorpions and ttirantulas are soiaetimea troublesome ; mos- 
quitoes infest the south, and the gnat and gadfly the middle regions. Europe is gener- 
ally, however, considerwi by naturalists as the grand region of butterfiies. The Â£uro- 
pean " annelides " include the medicinal leech, so plentiful in the pools of Germany, 
Sweden and Poland. Badiated animals, zoophytes, etc, axe particularly abundant on 
the southern coasts, where some of them, as the " actinias," are used as food, and where 
the coral fisheries employ many bands.

Origin of the existing Nations and States of Europe, â€” For the origin of the existing States 
and Nations of Europe, we must go back sixteen centuries, to the commencement of thai 
inidux of barbarous tribes from the east and north, by whom the Roman empire, after long 
struggles, was finally overwhelmed and extinguished. 

In the third century of the Christian era, the Roman empire included, besides Asia St 
nor, Syria, Egypt, and northern Africa, all continental Europe south of the Danube and 
west of the Rhine ; also the province of Dacia (now Moldavia and Wallachia), north of 
the Danube, and all that portion of Great Britain south of the Scotch mountains. Easi 
of the Rhine dwelt the Germans, divided into many tribes, among the most formidable 
of whom were the Goths, who, when they first became known to the Romans, occupied 
the regions north of the Black Sea. About A. D. 260, they commenced the invasion of 
the Roman empire, crossing the Danube and the Black Sea and ravaging Greece and 
Asia Minor; the Franks and the Allemanni (from whom comes the French name for Gcf- 
roany â€” Allemmgne) at the same time crossing the Rhine into Gaul (France). 

Partly by arms and partly by arts, especially by recruiting the Roman armies from 
among the barbarians themselves, these nrst invaders were repelled ; but the (Joths suc- 
ceeded in establishing themselves along the north bank of the Danube, in the foraier Bo- 
man province, when they were converted to Christianity, which, in the mean time, had 
become the religion of the Roman Empire. From this position, bv a new movement, 
commencing far to the east, the Gtoths were again, about A. D. 400, precipitated upon 
the Roman Empire, which in the mean while had been divided into two goveraments, 
the Empire of the West, or Latin Empire, with Rome as its chief city, and the Empire 
of the East, or Greek Empire, of which Constantinople was the capital. 

The Huns, a Tartar nation, whose primitive seats were on the borders of China, \av 
ing been driven, by unfortunate wars, to the westward, attacked the Alans, who dwelt 
between the Volga and the Don, and drove them upon the Goths, who were thus again 
compelled to cross the Danube. A. D. 378 the Vi8igoths,or Western Gtoths, conjointly with the 
Huns and Alans invaded Thrace, and defeated the Roman emperor Valens at Adrianopic 
Their king Alaric was invested with the government of Blyricum (Dalmatia and the south- 
em provinces of Turkey). In 403, he invaded Italy, twice threatened Rome with destrao-

lis suoceseor, Atbaulf^ made peaoe wi1Â» emperor Honorius, and coDducted his Visigoths to 
3aiil or France; and in 414 to Spain; where the Visigoths soon became the ruling nation* 
bunding an empire which also oompiieed Ouyenne, Gbscc^ne, and Languedoc,in France. 

Other Ctermanic tril^es, had moved westward, and, crossing the Rhine in 406, had set- 
led themselves permanently in various parts of the Roman empire. The Vandals had 
lieir primitive seat in the north of Gennany, betweea the Elbe and Vistula ; but, in the 
irst half of the 4th century, they migrated to Hungary, whence they marched succes- 
lively into France, Spain, and Afirica. The Bubovni>ians, residing in the vidnity of the 
Vandals, were compelled by the Oepidef^^. Grothic tribe) to move from the mouth of the 
Vistula into Giermany, ana afterward into Switzerland and the south-eastern provinces 
>f France. The Sueves, who had their primitive seat near the Elbe, joined the Alans 
iod Vandals on their march to the south-west of Europe, and took possession of the right 
>ank of the Rhine, called from them Suabia. 

In 426, the last Roman troops withdrew from Britanniaj or England, which was after- 
w^urds invaded and ravaged by the Scots. The Britons thereupon asked the assistance 
>f two tribes of Germany, the Saxons, occupying the prjesent kingdom of Hanover and 
he duchy of Holstein, and the Angles, inhabiting the present du(Â£y of Sleswick. They 
â€¢eadily complied with the request, went oyer to Britain, and drove back the Scots ; but, 
instead of returning to Grermany, they took possession erf the country. Britain was after- 
ffrards divided by them into seven small kingdoms, called the Saxon Heptarchy, But the 
^hole western portion of the Island was stiU held by the Celtic race, who had independ- 
ent principalities in Cornwall^ South WaleSj North vFaleSj CunAerland, and Strath Clyde. 
The Scots of the same race with the Irish, and the Hcts of uncertain but probably of 
Teutonic origin, held the whole of Caledonia. Thus, A. D. 700, the island of Great Brit- 
sdn was divided among some fifteen chiefs, engaged in perpetual wat^, 

The Hunsj under their king AUilay had meanwhile reappeared on the European theatre. 
At the head of 700,000 men belonging to various subject nations, Attila marched from 
Hungary into Gtermcmy, ravaging and plundering everywhere. He then invaded France; 
bat in a bloody battle at Chalons on the Marne, in 451, he was defeated ; after which he in- 
vaded Italy, where he died in 452. After his death, his empire was dissolved, and the 
Huns, dispersed by degrees among other nations, disappeared as a distinct community. 

In the year 476 Italy, with Rome itself, was entirely subjugated by Odoacerj leader of 
et northern tribe, called the HeruU; and it remained under his dominion for fourteen years, 
tiU he was conquered by the Ostrogoths or Eastern Goths. 

The OstrogvthSy who had transferred their seat into Bosnia and Thrace, were on good 
terms with the rulers of the Eastern empire, at Constantinople ; and Theodoricj their king, 
made to the emperor Zeno the offer to conquer Italy for him. His proposal was agreed to, 
and Theodoric emigrated with aU the Ostrogoths to Italv, defeated Odoacer in three bat- 
ties, made himself master of the whole country, and in 490 was, by emperor Anastasius, 
successor of Zeno, acknowledged as kinff of Italy. But after his death, which occurred 
in 526, the emperor Justirdan seiit to Italy two eminent commanders, BeUsarius and Nar- 
ses, who, after a struggle of eighteen years, made of Italy a province of the Eastern 
Empire. 

Meanwhile the Franks, in the period firom A. D. 237 to A. D. 375, got possession of 
the northern part of Gaul, from them called France. Meroveus, who died in 458, was the 
founder of the dynasty of the Merovvrigia/ns^ reigning in France for about three hundred 
years. The most eminent of the Merovingians was Clevis. He drove the Romans out 
of France, subdued the Anuoricans in Bretagne, subjected the Burgundians to tribute, 
wrested considerable tracts of land from the Visigoths in the south of France, and ex- 
tended his conquests northward to the Rhine. Clovis, having married a Christian prin- 
cess, and attributing his success to the God whom she worshipped, determined to become 
a Christian himself, and in 496, he was baptized, wiUi three thousand of his subjects, and 
aiK)inted king of the Franks, at Rheims, by the bishop Remigius. After his death in 511, 
France was divided among his four sons. This impolitie proceeding proved fatal to the 
common interest ; the more ^, as it was followed by subsequent divisions. At last, af*

empire, was divided into three dlstinol Slates, vis. AHstrasia^ or the east^n empire, eom* 
piising the north-east of Ghinl and the sonthem half of Germany, between Tyrol and the 
meat of Thoringia, and between the Rhine and the Inn rivers ; Neustria, or the wot 
am empire, comprising the north-west of Ghiul, between the Waal and Loire rivers; and 
Burgtmdj/j or the southern empire, comprising Provence, parts of Aqnitania, partB of 
Switzerland and Alsace. The capital of Austrasia was Metz, that of Neustria, &rissom^ 
and that of Burgundy Orleans. The Prankish kings used to invest eminent men (caBed 
Mofores donrng^ or Heads of the House) with the superintendence of the domains andfieii 
of the crown, and with the command of the royal military forces. One of them had 
the superintendence in Austrasia, another in Neustria, and a third in Burgundy. The 
last kings of the Merovingian dynas^ being weak, the Majores-domus came soon to be 
considered as the actual rulers. In 6o7, Pepin of HerskUl, the latter name derived from his 
estate near Liege, Major-domus of Austrasia, invested with the superintendence also of 
the other Prankish kingdoms, assumed the title of <<duke and prince of the Pranks." 
He was succeeded in his dignity by his son Qiarles Martell^ renowned for his brilliaiit 
and decisive victory over the Moors or Arabs, between Tours and Poitiers, in 733. 'Sift 
son and successor of Charles was Pepin the Little, who was indeed a very small man, 
but of mighty spirit, and of great strength. The weakness and inaptitude of the Men^ 
â–¼ingian lungs had now become too obvious ; and the last of them, Childeric IIL, was 
deposed, in 752, by an assembly of the states held at Soissons, and was exiled to a moa* 
astery ; while Pepin the Little was elected king of the Franks, and anointed by the bishop 
Bonifacius. With him began Ihe dynasty of the CarlopingianSy a name derived bm 
Pepin's son, Charles the Grreat, or Charlemagne. 

The TisigothSy since their inroad into Â£jpain, had established their power tiiere permanent- 
ly, and extended it, in the course of time, over all parts of the peninsula. After 531,tiieB 
capital and royal residence was Toledo. But as soon as the wars with other tribes and 
nations had ceased, there arose civil wars and other intestine commotions, which caused 
one party to call on the Moors or Arabs (who then had lately conquered the whole north- 
ern coast of Africa) for assistance. The latter acted the same part as the Saxons and 
Angles had done in Britain. Scarcely had they set their foot on the Spanish ground, in 
711, when they attacked the Visigoths and defeated them completely, in a battle at X^ 
res de la Frontera, which lasted nine days. The fate of Roderic^ the last king of the Visi- 
goths in Spain, was never known ; his horse and weapons were found near the field of 
battle, but his body was nowhere to be seen. PelagiOy a prince of the blood-royal, took 
command of the Uoths who had not been slain by the Moors, led them into tiie moni- 
tainous region of Asturias, and founded there a little kingdom, the boundaries of whidi 
his successors enlarged, in the course of time. But for several centuries, the Moors pos- 
sessed the greatest part of the Spanish peninsula. 

The Moors in Spain were in the beginning ruled by governors of llie Caliphs reigning 
at Damascus, but in 756 the Arabian prince Abderrahman founded an independent em- 
pire in Spain, whose capital was Cordova^ (north-east, and 120 miles distant from Cadiz), 
which soon rose to be a splendid city, and at one time, it is said, numbered 1,000,000 in- 
habitants. 

During the migmtion of nations, many countries in the east of Europe were depopo* 
lated, and this circumstance gave occasion to the Slaves, or Slavonic tribes to move far- 
ther to the west, and occupy the abandoned seats. The main body remained in Russia 
and Poland, but some tribes peopled Bohemia and others settled themselves in the Oct- 
man countries bordering on the Baltic Sea. Lower Hungary and Austria were oocnptcd 
by the AvareSy who had their primitive seat between the Black and Caspian Seas; Dabna- 
tia, and other countries in the vicinity, by the Oroates and Servians; and Bulgaria, bjtlie 
Bulgarians J a Tartar tribe, who in the 5th century had emigrated from their primitive mt 
between the Volga and Ural rivers. 

The Lombards (a Suevian or G^erman tribe, at first having their seat near the middle 
course of the Elbe), who had once ahready been called on for assistance by the imperial 
governor Narses, returned to Italy in 660, headed by their valiant king Alboiny wrested 
from the Greeks the northern part of the Italian peninsulf, since called Lombardj, and 
got possession of n\ost of the oth^ parts. Thej even threatened Rome, but pope 8te*

pbcn III, oatted on tte Frankiflh king, Pepin tlm little, for heip, and be defeated the 
Lombards, and compelled them to cede to tiie holy see the maritime eonntry on the Ad- 
riatic, whidi they udiely had conquered. In this way the pope's temporal power was 
ertablished, and me foundation laid of what is now called the States of the Church. 
This occurred in 755, but several centuries elapsed before the dominion of the pope was 
fiilly reiJized. In 774 new differences between the pope and the Lombards brought on 
the intervention of Cbariemagne, who vanqmsbed the Lombards completely ajKi em- 
bodied their kingdom witii that of the Franks. Lower Italy (comprising the continental 
part of the present kingdom of Naples) and the Island of Sicily remained under the 
sway of the Greek emperors until o42, when Sicily and Calabria came into the posseiB- 
sion of the Arabs. 

The European territory of the Eastern etnpirey or of the Roman emperors residing at 
Constantinople, had thus been greatly reduced; nevertheless, it yet ranked highest among 
the Christian kingdoms by its civilization, wealth, and flourishing commerce. Constan- 
tinople was the largest and hand86me8t city in Europe, and the imperial court displayed 
much splendor. 

Meanwhile the long-nourished hostile sentiments between the Franks and their next 
neighbors in ihe north, the Saxons^ had finally led to an eruption, which was followed by 
a war of more than thirty years ; when a final Ireaty of peace was concluded, according 
to which the Saxons acknowledged the sovereignty of Charlemagne, and adopted the 
Christian faith. 

In 778, the Moorish governor of Saragossa requested Cbariemagne to lend him his.as- 
sistance against the Emir Abderrabman. Accordingly, a Fmnkish army was sent to 
Spain, and this campaign terminated in the annexation of all the country north of the 
Ebro to the Frankish empire. This new acquisition was called the Spanish mark (mar- 
gmviate). A war against the Danes was terminated by a treaty of peace in 810, which 
stipnlateid that the Sider was to be the boundary between the Banes and Franks ; and 
this river has ever since been tiie boundary between Denmark and Grermany. To secure 
the boundaries in the east and south-east, against the Avares, Charlemagne founded there 
the Avarian markj comprising what is now called the arch-duchy of Austria. In the 
year 800 when Charlema^e happened to be at Romcf the pope (who for many substan- 
tial services, was higbfy indebted to him) placed the imperial crown upon his bead, and 
thus reviving the Western Roman Empire. Cbariemagne died in tbe*year 814, and 
was succeeded by bis son Louis, sumamed t^t Pious^ but in point of mental power al- 
moet the reverse of bis father. Louis died, in 840, and left his dominions to bis three 
sons, Louis, Charles, and Lotbaire, who divided them by a treaty, concluded at Verdun 
in 843, in the following manner : 

Lothaire acquired the imperial crown and the kingdom of Italy, and besides this a 
long tract of land situated between France and Germany, viz : Piroveneej Dawpkiny, 
Burgundy, Alsace, Lorraine, and the Netherlands. But bis race became extinct even so 
early as tiie year 875 ; and the German kings, his nearest relations, became the heirs of 
his rights* 

Charles, sumamed ihe Bald, acquired France, which was ruled by bis descendants 
until the year 987, when the Capetians, firom whom descended the Bourbons, supplanted 
the race of the Carlovingians. 

Louis, sumamed the German, acouired Oermany, which since that time has ever been 
separate firom PVance. After the deatii of his last descendant, in 911, an elective em- 
pire was established, which continued so late as 1806. But tiie imperial power soon 
declined ; and Germany became ultimately divided into a ffreat number of states, locally 
independent, and over which tiie imperial authority exerted but a slight restraint. 

As for England, one Saxon prince seems generally to have arrived at an ascendency 
over the rest. He who attained to this dignity was known by the official title of Betwalda, 
In tiie course of thrae hundred years, seven chiefs attained this dignity, which, at the be- 
ginning of the ninth century, was held by Egbert, king of Wessex, who bad long resided 
at the court of Charlemagne. This dignity, with additional pren^tives, thenceforward 
remained in his feunily, but without any such extensive alteration in the constitution of 
the kingdoms as is generally supposed ; for, long after his time, the inferior kings stiH

In Egbert's time coomieiieed the iaroada of the Nobmans and Daaea, damig fte^ 
hooters firom the eoasts of Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, who established theooaelTes 
in many maritime parts of Great Britain and Ireland, and at times overran the whok 
country. They also made conquests on the coasts of France, where^ at the e&d of the 
ninth century, they obtained the province of NormMdy^ and they even establiahed prindr 
palities in Il^y, wh^e they were first introduced at a somewhat lat^ period, as meie^ 
nary soldiers. King Alfred the Qreat (who reigned in England from the year 871 to 901) 
opposed them with good success ; but a hundred vears after his death, the Norroaot 
again broke into England, and were now completely victorious ; so that in tbe pmod 
from 1016 to 1043 three Danish kines ^veraed the country in succession (Swen, Camite, 
and Hardicanute). In the vear 104^, the Normans or Danes were driven out of Kngiaiid, 
and another Saxon king, Eaward JZ, sumamed tke Confessor^ was placed upon the tbroiia 
Meanwhile the Normans had settled in France, and acquired there, as already mentiono^ 
a large tract called Norfgumd^, William, duke of Normandy, who was related to king 
Edward, made claim to the English throne, and after Edward's death, which oceorzed is 
1066, he invaded England, at Ihe head of ^ty thousand men, defeat^ his rival Han^ 
son of Count Godwin (for Edward had left no children), in the battle of Hastings, on ihe 
14th of Oct. 1066, and became king of England. He was now called WilliamtheUcmqiieroi^ 
and is the ancestor of the still reigning royal fanaily of Ghreat Britain, 

TThe little Christian kingdom of A^turias, founded by Pelagic in Spain, was by tins 
time considerably enlarged, and called the Kingdom <tf Le(m. The Spamsh mc^k, caar 
qu^^d by Charlemagne, having been divided into two counties, Barcelona and Navaiie, 
and the count of Navarre having assumed the royal title, there were now two Christian 
kingdoms in Spain ; out of whioh grew, in the course of time, the kingdoms of Armgea^ 
Cehstiky Oalicioy the principaUty of CkUdhwiOy etc Portugal, first a pfovince of the 
united kingdoms of Castile and Leon, became in 1139 an mdependent kingdom. The 
power of the Moors in Spain was more and more restricted by the conquests of the Chris- 
tian kings, till in 1492 GranadOj the last Moorish possession, was conquered by the Queea 
Isabella of Castile, and king Ferdinamdoi Aragon. At this time 4he kingdom of Aiagoa 
comprised not*only Aragon, but the whole norui-east part of Spain, while the kingdom of 
Castile comprised all other paxts ; and i|^ Ferdinand and Isabella were united by ma^ 
riage, aU Spain came, after their death, under tbe sway, first of their daughter Johanna 

ior rather tiieir son-in-law Philip), tiien of their grandson, the celebrated king Charles L 
or Charles Y. as emperor of Crermany), who entailed tbe Spanish crown on his de- 
scendants. 

In the beginning of the tenth century, while western Europe was ravaged by the Nor- 
mans, the Magyars, the ancestors of the present Hungaricuis, appeared in the east and 
spread terror and devastation in Crermany and Italy. They continued for a century to be 
toe terror of Europe ; but at last, under their chief Qeyza, they began to apply them- 
selves to agriculture. Stephen, the son of Geyza, about A. D. 1000, introduced at the 
same time Christianity and the royal dignity, and subsequently the Hungarians became 
the great barrier of Europe against the Ottoman Turks. 

Othman, the founder of that famous dynasty, was a shepherd and a robber, belonging 
to one of the Turkish tribes bv whom Asia Minor had been for centuries overrun. He 
pillaged Bythinia, and graducJly (1299-1326) made himself master of a part of that 
province. His grandson Amuranth L, by whpm the Janizaries were first established, snb- 
dued Romania and many of the Sckivonic tribes between the Danube and the Adriatic 
(1360-89) ; and fiually Mohammed II. (1451*1481^ took Constantinople, subdued the rem- 
nants of the Greek emfdre, and spread consternation throughout Europe. Even for two 
oenturies subsequent to this period, the Turks w^e regarded as the common enemy of 
Christendom. 

Since the Turkish invasion, Europe has never been attacked by any external enemj* 
On the contrary, the people of Europe have, within the last four centuries, themsehet 
become the conquerors and dviljizers of b, la^ part of Aaia aad AÂ£nca, as well as of

CXmlttation. All Eoropeans are civiKzedy exce|>i the Lapkmdeni Samojedes, some 
Kalmuo tribes, and the Gipsies (tii6 latter chiefly in Hong^gry^ Russia, Spain, and Eng- 
land), who are to be regaraed as halfnavilized ; and as civilization has prevailed in this 
remon for many handn^yeaM, Europe is mot only the most enlightened, but also the beat 
cmtivated ^rand division of -the earth. By its emi^rants^ America, and all the civilized coun- 
tries of other parts of the world, have been peopled. Husbandry is at the highest pitch 
of improvement in England, Germany, Belgium, Holland, Switzerland, andLombardy. 
In manufactures and commerce, Grreat Britain excels all other empires ; but in many 
branches of manufactures, it finds a formidable rival id Frsmce, Belgium, and Grerma- 
ny. The states of Europe, next after Great Britain in commeicial importance, are : 
France, Germany, Holland, Russia, Austria, etc The improvement of all the sciences, 
and the finest productions of genius, belong exclusively to the Europeans. In almost ail 
European countries, numerous universities, coUecps, and other schools, provide for every 
branch of learning ; and, on the other hand, the fine arts have their chief seat in Europe. 
All the great painters, sculptors, artists in music, architects, and poets of ancient and 
modem times, were Europeans, or their descendants. There are to be found, it is true, 
huge monuments of ancient architecture in Africa, Asia, and America, but compared 
with the sublime works of the ancient Greeks and Romans, with the Gk>thic buildings 
of the middle ages, and even with the performances of modern architects in Europe, they 
must yield the palm. Most of the European countries are noted for their excellent 
roads (above aU England), and only Turkey and Hungary are without them. Canals 
are most numerous in England, but are found also in Russia, Holland, Belgium, prance, 
and Sweden. Besides this, England is crossed in almost every direction by rsAoads 
ivhich are now also to be found in every countiy of the continent.

Productive Industry. Since the close of the great European war by the overthrow of 
the elder Bonaparte, things in Europe have assumed an aspect such as they have never 
exhibited before, and which promises in the end, to work an entire revolution in the so- 
cial condition, not only of Europe but of the whole world. Previous t5 the period above 
named, the industry of trade and manufactures was principally confined to England and 
Holland, and the production of wealth seemed to be regarded as a very inferior con- 
cern by all the great nations of the continent ^ At present, the grand strife seems to be 
which nation shall surpass the other in productive aurts ; and although immense military 
establishments are still kept up at a vast expense, the disinclination to make war upon 
each other is verv strong among the European states. They employ their arms against 
inferior and semi-barbarous nations ; England against the Afghans, Chinese, Caffirs and 
Burmans ; France against the Arabs and Berbers of Algiers, and Russia gainst the Cir- 
cassians ; but they show no disposition to make war upon each other. The contests in 
which they indulge among themselves, relate rather to the engrossment of trade, and the 
extension of markets for the produce of their own domestic industry. 

2. Shipping'. The following statement of the tonnage belonging to the different stated 
of Europe in 1843, may furnish an idea of the respective extent of their maritime com- 
merce. It is worthy of note that the city of New York owns as much shipping as the 
whole kingdom of France, and much more than any other state of continental Europe. 
The tonnage of all, or most of these nations hsts considerably increased in the last ten 
years. That of Great Britain, exclusive of her colonies, at the beginning of 1852, was 
3,460,656 tons, but no other European nation has increased in any thing like the same 
proportion.

it has lately attained an increase of influence through ibt position at the head of the

em Australia, Van Diemen^s Land, Norfolk Island, New Zealand. 

9. Various Islands, in the South Atlantic, and Pacific, viz. FaUdand Islands, Auchland 
Islands, St. Helena, etc 

The total area of all these possessions and colonies is estimated at 5,000,000 square 
miles, and the total population at 150,000,000 inhabitants, of almost all the knovm races, 
languages, and religions, and including portions of all the various climates and quar- 
ters of the globe. Indeed, it has been exultingly remarked, that on the British Empire 
the sun never sets. 

Origin and Policy. â€” The founders of the British Empire were the inhabitants of the 
island of Great Britain, 90,000 squaie miles in extent, with a present population of about 
21,000,000. All the other parts of the empire, except a few islands originally colonised by 
Englishmen, were Eicquired by conquest. Such was the case even with Ireland, of wbira 
the native inhabitants were long regarded as foreign barbarians ; nor, till very recenttf, 



BRITISH EMPIRE. 8ff 

were any political rights enjoyed by the great bulk of the native Irish. The exclnsion, im 
deed, had ceased to be foonded on race ; bat the denial to Catholics of political rights 
amonnted, in substance, to an exclusion of the native Irish, who adhered with few except 
ticms to that faith. Siqce the revolt of the North American colonies (now the United 
States of America), occasioned by the attempt of the mother-country to oraw the reins of 
authority too tight, and especially within the last twenty years, the policy pursued to- 
wards the subordinate portions of the empire, has been greatly liberalized. The Irish 
have, by degrees, acquired almost all the rights of British citizens, though they continue 
to complain loudly of certain disabilities and inferiorities to which, on the score of religion, 
they are still subjected. Since the passac^e of the Reform Bill, in 1834, the spirit and 
method of the administration of the British colonies, have undergone a complete revo- 
lution. The old fashioned colonial policy taught that the interests of the colonies were 
to be made entirely subordinate to those of the mother-country. Hence great restrictions 
-were formerly placed upon the trade and industry of the British Colonies, with the avowed 
object of favoring, at the expense of the colonies, the trade and manufactures of the 
mother-country. This policy has been almost, if not indeed wholly, renounced. The Co- 
lonial Tariff Bill, introaucea into Parliament and carried through by Sir Robert Peel, has 
placed the Colonies, in this respect, about on a level with the mother-country. This spirit 
of liberality has been extended even to India, a disposition being exhibited to bring for- 
ward the more influential natives and attach them to British interests, by giving them 
some share in the administration of affairs. Throughout the British dominions, in yrhat- 
ever part of the globe, that great and important instrument, the freedom of the press, is 
in foil operation ; but it is only within about ten years past, that the press has become free 
in India and the Colonies. 

2. ChvemmetU and PolUics. â€” - The government of the British Empire is nominally a 
monarchy, but it has ceased to be so in reality. The queen is a mere puppet in the hands 
of the ministry, with no mind and no opinion of her own. It was lately observed in thfe 
Times newspaper, the leading journal of the kingdom, in reference to certain changes in 
the commercial policy of the country, that the Queen's private opinion (if she had any) 
upon the question, was a matter of far less importance or interest than the private opin- 
ion of Miss Martineau ; for Miss Martineau's opinion might have weight in some quartersi 
ivhereas, the Queen's opinion would have no weight with anybody. Since the accession 
of the house of Hanover, the regal element in the government has been constantly de^ 
dining. George IIL was able, occasionally, to exercise some personal influence by play* 
ing off one political party against the other. The present queen, like her father, is a 
merely nominal sovereign ; nor is it likely that any future king will ever recover the slight- 
est shadow of authority. 

The control of the government, which rests with the Parliament, is in the hands of a 
small class of wealthy men. The Parliament consists of two Houses, that of the Lordsj 
including the bishops, and the Commons or Lower House. The number of voters for 
members of the Lower House, with which the selection of ministers substantially rests, is 
about 1,000,000 ; but a majority of the membeili are chosen by a small minority of the 
voters ; and of that mincurity the larger part vote as their landlords and patrons command, 
or else sell their votes to the highest bidder. The number of really independent voters is 
quite sraalL In the country^ the tenants-at-will, who constitute the largest class, are 
obliged to vote as their landlords require ; and in the towns, the shop-keepers and mechan* 
ics are very much under the control of their employers and wealthy customers. The vot- 
ing is viva voce. An attempt has been made to introduce voting by secret ballot, but that 
is resisted, lest the voters might thus be able to conceal their vote and follow Iheir own 
choice, instead of that of their landlords. 

The actual administration of the government, though carried on in the name of the 
reigning king or queen, is in the hands of certain high offices, who compose what is called 
the Ministry. These officers are nominally appointed and dismissed at the pleasure of the; 
Crown ; but in reality they are solely indebted for their offices to their ability to carry, 
with them, in support of their policy, a majority of the House of Commons; in failure of 
which they resign, as a matter of course ; whereupon the government passes to more 
powerful parliamentary leaders. Of these ministers, the chief is the JFirst Lord of the. 



86 BmTISH EMPIRE. 

Treaswryy whose nominal doty is the receiving and isstdng of the pnblfe money, whBe 
his actnal station is that of leader of the admiMsimtioii ; he is the first who ie appointed 
in any ministry, and generally selects all the olher members, according to his own views 
of their abilities, or of the inflnence they possess in the country or in Parliament ] aad 
any changes afterwards made are generally at his suggestion, or at least with his fcill as- 
sent Next is the Lord Btff'h Chancellor, who presides in ifae fadghest law court of the 
kingdom, and is Speaker of the House of Lords ; he is chief advisar in all that relatea to 
the laws of the country ; and has the disposal of a great number of clerical and law of- 
fiees. After him are the principal secretaries of state,^wbo are five in number, eaoh 
having a separate charge ; the first is Secretary for the Home Department, after whom 
are the Secretaries for Foreign Aflairs and for the CkJonies, Hie Secretary at VITar, and 
the Secretary for Ireland. These, with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and several othen 
of the high officers of state, form what is called the Mnistry, the Cabinet CoancB, or 
briefly the Cabinet ; and dil the measures of the executive government are settled by tiieir 
d^iberations. 

The'' regular division of labw which is estabMshed in the British government, is one erf 
its chief excellences ; because every secretary, or other office of state, having a partxmlBr 
department assigned to him, the responsibility is established at once for any enror or mis- 
management, which may be either rectified or punished. Parliament itself has its duties; 
and when these are not performed to Ihe satisfaction of the Actors, the members cam be 
dismissed at next election, to make way for others. 

The executive government of Ireland is vested in a liOtA Lieutenant, who is appointed 
by and dependent on the ministry. He is assisted by a Privy Council, a body also nomi- 
nated by the ministry, and invested with great powers, judicial and ministerial ; and idso 
by a Chief Secretary, who is always a member of the House of Commons, and naore im- 
mediately the responsible member of the Irish government The counties are under the 
headship of Lords Lieutenant and High Sheriifs, as in England The levy and ex- 
penditure of money for local purposes, is vested in the local grand-juries. There is no 
pofilical government of Scotiand distinct from that of Great Britain. The Colonies and 
dependencies have each its own local administration. 

Judiciary. The judiciary is v^ complicated There are in Sngiand three dislinrt 
codes by which thfe Supreme Courts are related, viz : the Common Law, which is ad- 
ministered in the Court of Queen's Bench, Common Pleas and Exchequer; the Civil, 
and Ecclesiastical Laws, which axe administered by the Ecclesiastical and AdmiraUy 
judges ; and Equity, which forms the basis of pleas in the Cocnrt of Chanony. The 
judges of the Queen's Bench, Common Pleas and Bxoheqner, are the judicial asseason 
of the House of Lords ; to which final appeal lies in all cases in law and equity, ex- 
cept appeal cases from the colonies, which are heard and decided by a committee of the 
PVivy Council composed of the legal members of that body. These judges abo make 
periodical circuits through the entire counties of England and Wales, where, at the as- 
sizes^ they administer civil and criminal justice. The m^agistrates of cities and IxMoaghs 
are IStewtse invested with judicial functions, and by the municipal Reform Act a anifiomi 
system has been estaUished in all boroughs, except London. Inev^ county tiieie are a 
number of justices of the peace, who are inoividually eommitting magistrates, and eoUeo- 
ISvelv act as judges at the county sessions. The most important cases, however, are 
left K>r the assize judges to determine. For the decision of smaller civil cases the old and 
long disused system of county courts has been lately revived, but with important modifi- 
cations. The sherifl^ are appointed by ^e sovereign annually, from thiee persons presented 
for selection, and are in their own counties keepers of the king's peace, executive offieeis 
of the Supreme Courts, and bailifl^ to the crown. The coroner is chosen by the free- 
holders of the country. There are usually four coroners to each county who hold their 
offices during fife. The subordinate keepers of the peace are the usual bodies of conata- 
Mes and poUce. The Lords Lieutenant are keepers <^ the Becords in their respective 
counties and first justices of the peace. 

The laws of Scotland are, like those of England^ a heterogeneous, ill-digested mass, 
ttie accumulation of ages, and derive their authority chiefly from the decisions of the 
npreme courts, or established custom* These are administered by the Court of Ses- 



BRITmH EMPIEB. 8^ 

Bions, and the ISgh CJotut of Jasticiaiy. The first is the stipreme civil court of law, and by 
virtue of its inherent supremacy, exercises the ministerial functions of the Court of Chan- 
eery, in respect to the guardiaiiship of children, idiots and lunatics, and the property of 
absentees ; and in all cases decides according to equity as well as law. Appeal lied t6 
the House of Lords* The High Court of Justicioury is a criminal tribunal^ and is striotfy 
supreme, there being no appeal from its decisions. Evenr county is placed under a sher- 
iff who is both jud^ and magistrate. There is in Scotland an officer of high rank and 
dignity, styled Her Majesty's Advocate, or by courtesy the Lord Advocate, who, with the 
assistance of the Solicitor General and several advocates-d^ute, superintends the whole 
criminal business of the countrjvand acts as public prosecutor in eases brought before 
the High Court of Justiciary. The counties have eadr a similar officer styled Procura- 
toi-fisc^, whose duties are confined to his own ierritprial limits. These functionaries 
always act under the Lord Advocate, and report to hltti all thelt proceedings. The or- 
ders and decrees of the Supreme Court are executed by a class of officials styled Mes- 
sengers-at-arms, appointed by the Lord Lyon King at Arms. The lowest official in 
Scotland is the ^^Haogman ^ of Edinburgh, the omy person ojf his profession betweÂ«ii 
York and the Shetland^ 

The administration of the laws in Ireland is vested in the Lord Chancellor, assisted 
by the Master of tiie Bolls ; and in the twelve judges of the Supreme Courts, of King's 
Bench, Common Pleas and Exchequer. The twelve judges visit the counties in six cir- 
cuits twice a year, for the trial of civil causes in nidprius and criminal cases of a more 
serious character. Minor offences are determined before magistrates at petty sessions. 
Stipendiary magistrates are now stationed in the large towns. 

Each of tiie colonies has a Judicial system of its own, with an appeal in certain eases 
to the Privy Council, as akeady mentioned. 

DebU At the revolution of 1688, the national debt amounted to only jE664,263 ; at the 
present time the amount is Â£765,000,000, with an interest of Â£27,500,000. 

Revenue. Th^ revenue which it is necessary to raise for the purpose of paying the inÂ« 
terest of the debt, and conducting the business of the country, is derived from taxation 
upon a very great variety of different articles, which are all^ however, reduced to the folÂ« 
lowing heads :

jreafly simplified, and a very large number of articles added to the free list Nineteen-

to the country, (chiefly nnder the management of the Board of Woods and Forests,) 
and the soTereign has a civil list of fixed suns regokurlv voted by Parliament 

On the accession of Victoria, sums were voted for the royal household, amounting in 
the aggregate to Â£386,000, with power to the crown to grant pensions not exceemng 
Xl,200 in any one year. The cost of the Civil Department of the government does not 
fidl ninch short of three millions a year, and is distributed among about 22,000 func- 
tionaiies ; in this, however, is indnded the expenses of the Irish government. The an* 
nnal expenses for ambassadors and consuls to and in foreign countries are about jÂ£300,- 
000, and for courts of justice, nearly Â£800,000. Altogether the civil management of the. 
kingdom costs Â£4,000,000 annually. ^ 

Next to the national debt, the army and navy are the greatest burden on the country ; 
the average expense of these are respectively, about Â£6,000,000 annually, or together 
Â£12,000,0<)0, a sum much more than equivalent to all the ordinary expenses of the United 
States government. 

Army. According to the terms of the constitution, a permanent or standing army is 
not held to be legal It is understood that the civil power, as exerted by magistrates, 
constables, and police, is competent to preserve order, and that the creation of a mil- 
itary force is only a matter of temporary necessity. An army, however, being constant- 
Ijr required, both to assist the authority, and to protect the foreign possessions of the em* 

Eire, an act of parliament, called the Mutiny Act, is passed annually, to maintain a large 
ody of troops in regular service. The privates in tiie army are enlisted by small boun* 
ties from the lowest classes of the community, and very* rarely, if ever, are promoted to 
the rank of commissioned officers. The commissioned officers, in general, belong to the 
aristocracy or landed gentry, and in most instances purchase their commission accord- 
ing to a scale of prices. Although both privates and officers are alike ill-prepared, bv 
previous instruction, for performing the duties of their profession, such are the effects ol 
discipline, the excellence of equipment, and other advantages, but above all, a high tone 
of honor and spirit of valor, that the British army is found able to compete with forces 
recruited under far more favorable circumstances. 

The British army on the 1st of June, 1848, consisted of two regiments of Life Guards , 
one of Boyal Horse Guards ; seven of Dragoon Guards ; four of Light Dragoons ; four 
of Dragoons ; four of Huzzars, and four of Lancers â€” comprising the cavalry. The foot 
or infantry arm consisted of one regiment, in three battalions, of Grenadier Guards ; 
one of Coldstream Guards ; one of Scotch Fusileer Guards ; and one of Rifle Brigade, 
each having two battalions ; and 99 re^ments of foot in 138 battalions. There were 
also one regiment of Artillery in nine battalions ; one corps of Engineers, and one corps of 
Sappers and Miners â€” altogether numbering nearly 9,000 horses and 120,000 men, of 
whom about 14,000 are officers and non-commissioned officers. This number was ex- 
clusive of the Indian army, and the several colonial regiments known as the Ceylon Bi- 
fle Regiment, the three Royal West India Regiments, the Cape Mounted Rifles, the St 
Helena Regiment, the Malta Royal Fencibles, the Royal Canadian Rifles, and the Royal 
Newfoundmnd Veteran Corps. Of the British army (properly so called) from 20,000 to 
25,000 men are generally stationed in Ireland ; about 30,000 serve in India ; from 10,000 
to 12,000, including artillery and engineers, in Ghreat Britain, and the remainder are dis- 
persed in America, the West Indies, and the British colonies and possessions in difierent 
parts of the world. ^ 

The pay of a private in the horse guards varies from Is. 9d. to 2s. 0|d. per day ; in the 
oavalrv of the line. Is. 4d. ; in the foot guards Is. 2d. ; and in the infantry of the line, Is. 
Id. When at home and in barracks, 6d. a day is deducted from this, for which the sol- 
dier receives three quarters of a p9und of meat, and one pound of bread. The princi- 
pal part of his clothes and accoutrements is furnished at the public expense ; his paj, 
Dowever, is subject to a deduction of 2s. 7^ a week, in the case of privates serving m 
the cavalry; Is. Id a week from privates inthe foot gaaids,.and Is. 6d. from all other 
privates, on account of these articles.

tised 'witboot interfeMnee bam any qaarter wfafttev^r. All denominations of ChristianR 
nave their own otrarchei^ empl^ Whom they {rfeaae as their paetors, and are equally under 
the protection of the law. The empire contains seyeral established or predominant 
churches, which are supported by special acts* of Hie legislature. In England and 
Irdtand there is one Church, denominated the United Church of England and Ireland 
(separate before the union of the two countries in 1800), being a Protestant Episcopacy. 
in ' Scotland, the established religion is Protestant Presbyterian. The religion of the 
Boglish churchy and also the law of England, are established in every colony by th* 
simple act of adding the territory to the crown, unless there be a special provision to the 
contrary. Thus the Church of England prevails in all the great colonial dependencies, 
except Lower Canada, which is guaranteed a Roman Catholic hierarchy ; the Cape of 
Gtood Hope, which has been guaranteed Protestant Presbyterianism ; Malta, which is 
Roman Catholic ; and so on with some minor colonial possessions. 

The affidrs of the Church of England are managed by archbishops and bishops, but 
no step of any importance, out of the ordinary routine, can be taken without an act of 
Padiament, and therefore the church may be said to be governed by the legislature of 
the country. The sovereign is the head, of the church, which is thus in intimate union 
with the stote. The laity, except through their representatives in the House of CommonS| 
possess no right to interfere in any shape with I3ie doctrines or practice of the church. 
The doctrines defined by law are contained in the Thirty-nine Articles, and the form of 
'worship is the Book oi Common Prayer. Ecclesiastically, the country is divided into 
dioceses, each of which is under the care of a bishop or archbishop ; the dioceses 
are classed under two provinces, each of which is under the charge of an archbishop. 
The dioceses are as follow*: Province of Canterbury â€” Canterbury, London, Winches- 
ter, Litchfield and CoveritrV. Lincoln, Ely, Salisbury, Exeter, Bath, and Wells, Chiches- 
ter, Norwich, Worcester, Hereford, Rochester, Oxford, Peterborough, Gloucester, and 
Bristol, Llandaif, St David^s, St Asaph, and Bangor. Province of York â€” York, Dur- 
ham, Carlisle, Chester, Manchester, Bodor and Man, and Bipon. Gloucester and Bristol 
were separate until lately. It is designed to unite the diocese of Sodor and Man to that 
of Chester, and the diocese of St Asaph to that of Bangor. Ripon and Manchester 
are now bishoprics. The archbishop of York is styled " Primate or England;" and the 
archbishop of Canterbury, who ranks next to the royal family, is styled " Primate of all 
England.*^ Not less than twenty-seven bishops of the Church of England, have been 
appointed for the various colonies and foreign dependencies of the empire. The other 
dignitaries of the church are archdeacons, deans, and prebendaries; the inferior clergy 
are rectors, vicars and curates. Strictly there are only tnree grades, bishops, priests, and 
deacons, all clergymen belonging to one of these. The bishops are entitled to be 
addressed as ** Mv Lord," being legally spiritual peers. The revenues exigible, by law> 
for the support of the churchy are most unequally distributed, and the dioceses are of very 
unequal proportions. The same may be saia of the working clergy, some of whom 
have wealthy, and others very poor benefices ; while curates, or assistents, are paid on 
the meanest scale. The foUoviong table, extracted from a parliamentary paper, shows the 
namber of benefices or livings, parishes, churches and chapels in each diocese : â€”

The revenues of the archbishops and bishops amount in the a^regate to JC 150,000 pe^ 
annum. The largest incomes are those of the archbishop of Canterbury, about X17, 
000 ; Archbishop of York, Â£10,000 ; Bishop of Durham, X8,000 ; Bishop of LonAa, 
Â£11,700 ; Bishop of Winchester, Â£10,500 ; and Bishop of Ely, Â£5,500 ; the otho^ 
vary from about Â£2,500 to Â£5,000. The greater part of these revenues are derived fio^ 
lands, or rents for grounds let on leases, and for which fines are taken at entry. Tk 
chapters of cathedmls, composed of deans, canons, and prebends, possess alio kig^ 
revenues ; the dean of Durham, for instance, having Â£4,800 a year, and other membq 
of the chapter, Â£32^60. The gross revenues of the deans and chapters amount to vf' 
wards of Â£235,000. The colonial bishops receive from Â£800 to Â£5,000 each, pa^ 
for the most part, by parliamentary grants. The revenues of the inferior or paiocha^ 
clergy are derived from tithes commuted into money payments, and also fees at celebrity 
ing marriages, baptisms and funerals. With respect to the parochial branch of chnitb 
emoluments, we extract the following from Mr. IVrCulloch's Statistical Account:â€” *^^ 
appears that of 10^78 benefices, from which returns have been received, 292 are niuk 
Â£50 a year ; 1629 are between Â£50 and Â£100 a year ; and 1607 are between Â£100 an^ 
Â£150 ; so that there are 1,926 benefices under Â£100 a year, and 3,528, or more than I 
third of all the benefices in the country, under Â£150 a year. On many of these bcne^ 
fices there are no glebe houses, nor do thev possess the means of erecting any. Weretbe 
spiritual duties of the poorest of these hvings not performed by the clergymen of the 
neighboring parishes, it is difficult to see how they could be performed at alL'' Cnratea 
are paid by the rectors or vicars, whose servants they are ; by law, their salary cannot b^ 
under Â£80 â€” the average is Â£81* 

The total revenues of the English church may be stated in general terms as follow:â€” 

Archbuhops atid Insbops Â£150,000

The appointment of the cler^ to benefices is as foUow: presented by the arown,95J; 
by archbishops and bishops, 1^48 ; by deans, chapters, and ecclesiastical corporation^ 
2,638; by universities, colleges, and hospitals, 721; by private individuals, 5,096; wi 
by municipal corporations, 53. 

In 1847, the total number of congregations belonging to the Established chnich vc 
11,855. At the same time there were the following nundber of congren^tions of DiweBtesi

inistio Methodists, 007; Wesleyan Methodists, 2,818 ; other Methodists, 666 ; Quakers, 
â€¢96; Home-Bfissioiiaiy congregations, 453; Unitarians, 360 ; total of Dissenting congre- 
[ations (exclasiye of .lews), 9,ol2. It is considered probable that this number includes 
18 many actual worshippers as the 11,855 congregations of the Establishment, or about 
l|500,000. Thus, reckoning Dissenters and members of the Established church at 9,000,000, 
tboat 7,000,000 remain, who cannot be said distinctly to attend any place of worship, 
hough in most instances nominally belonging to the Established church. 

In Ireland, the established religion is the same Protestant Episcopacy, of which an 
itheir branch is established in England. The same doctrines, ritual, and forms of ecdesi- 
istical government exist in these two countries, the hierarchies only being different with 
aspect to their political status. Formerly there were four archbishoprics : Armagh, Dub- 
in, Cashel, and Tuam, with thirty-two dioceses under eighteen bishops. Under a new 
urrangement thete are only two archbishops, those of Armagh and Dublin, and ten bish- 
)p8. The archbishop of Armagh is styled " Primate and Metropolitan of *all Lreland f * 
ind the archbishop of Dublin is styled ** Primate and Metropolitan of Ireland." The 
lomber of parishes, including perpetual-curacies, is 2,405 ; but many have no church, 
ind the number of incumbents for the whole is only 1,385. According to the proposed 
irrangements, the money saved by the extinction of higher offices is to be appropriated 
to sustain churches and glebe-houses in parishes, and to execute other necessary purposes. 
The revenue of the Irish archbishops and bishops amount to<Â£151,128 annually; and 
the total income of the church, including the value of glebe-lands and tithes, is about 
Â£700,000. 

The Roman Catholic church in Ireland, supported by the voluntary contributions of 
the people and certain fees exacted for spiritual services, consists of four archbishops and 
twenty-four bishops, with 1,013 parish priests, 1,394 curates, and other priests (regulars) 
About 300 ; total clergy, 2,735. The number of Koman Catholic chapels is 2,205 ; col- 
leges, 25 ; convents, 56 ; nunneries, 93 ; and monasteries, 42. After the Roman Catholic 
body, the chief Dissenting communion is that of the Presbyterians, in the northern parts 
of tne country, with about 500 congre^tions. 

The established Church of Scotland is Presbyterian in its form of government The 
clergy are all equal in rank, and are officially ministers of parishes. To the church belongs 
ft body of lay functionaries called elders, each church having several, who assist the cler- 
gymen at the communion, visit the sick, and generally act as a vigilant ecclesiastical 
police. This incorporation of laity with the church has given it a remarkably secure foot- 
ing in the affections of the people. The ecclesiastical community is governed by a series 
j{ coarts-<^the lowest being the kirk-session in every parish, composed of the minister 
md elders ; the next is a court composed of the clers^y of a division, called a presbytery, 
ind an elder from each parish ; the next is a synodal court, composed of functionaries 
torn an aggregation of presbyteries ; and the highest is the General Assembly, composed 
j{ delegates from the presbyteries, and which meets annually at Edinburgh. Constant 
residence in their parishes is obligatory on the clergy. The number is about 1000. 

The parochial clergy are supported by money stipends levied from the heritors or land- 
owners, on the principle of conmiuted tithes or teinds. The amount of stipends yearly, 
lepends on the average market-value of com, the averages being called ftarSj which are 
itrack annually by a jury in every county. Each minister being entitled to a certain 
mantity of grain, the value of the quantily, according to the fiars, is paid in money. If 
lie teiiKb in the hands of the heritors be not all upufted, the stipend is liable to be inÂ« 
veased at the end of every twenty years. The gross amount of teinds, paid to the clergy 
Manually, is about jÂ£150,000. The total income of the church, including value of glebes 
md manses, is calculated at JS875,000. In some parishes, the exigible stipend is so small, 
bat it is made up to a minimum of JS150 by government Among the largest stipends 
ire tbose' paid to the eighteen parish ministers of Edinburgh, who receive about Â£500 
lach, levied by a peculiar law as a money-tax from the inhabitants. 

The appointment of the ministers rests with certain large proprietors called Patrons. 
the attempt to regain for tile parishes the right of rejecting nominations not agreeable to 
fcem, led recentiy to a large secession from the Establishment and the institution of a 
lew Communion called the Free Chwrch of ScatUmd^ which has been largely endowed

Public Education. â€” Endand is ahnost the onlv country in Europe in whidi tkele k 
no Bystem of edueation. For the instruction of. ner clergy and gentry, she has sevenJ 

Seat public classical schools, among which are those of Winchester, W estminstar, Eton, 
arrow. Charterhouse and Rugby, and also two great universities, Qxfcmi and Gam- 
bridge. To these have lately been added the University of London, consisting of two 
colleges, founded and endowed by private subscription, and named University College 
and King's College ; the Durham* University, founded and endowed by the Bishop and 
Chapter; St David's College at Lampeter in South Wales, founded by Jh. Bnrgeas 
the Bishop of St David's, for the educeUiOn of Welsh clergymen ; and several othen. 
There are also colleges founded by the Dissenters ; those of Haileybury and Addiacombe, 
belonfi^ing to the Etist India Company ; Sandhurst Boyal Military College'; and Portsmouth 
Eoyal Naval College. 

The following institutions are empowered to issue certificates to candidates for degrees 
from the University of London, in Arts and Laws : the Universities of the United Â£ng- 
dom; University College, London; King's College, London; New College, London; 
New College, IVmnchester f Owen's College, JMLanchester ; Spring- Hill CoU^e, Birming-

Bedford Ghrammar Schools ; Breton Independent College. 

Elementary instruction is given to the children of the poorer dasses by endowed andC^la^ 
ity Schools, and the children of the middle classes are chiefly educated at schools of jnivate 
taichers. There are in England about 4,S00 endowed schools, 18,000 unendowed schools, 
and a large number of Sunday schools, educating 1,500,000, or one-tenth of the entire 
popidation, instead of the sixth, which Prussia has shown to be the prop^ amount of 
school-attenders. Thus England is shown to enjoy little more than half the propa 
amount of education, even supposing the education she did enjoy to be good. 

Of late, additional schools have been opened, particularly in connection with factories, 
mechanics' institutions, and by subscription. At present, a oonsiderable proportion of tbi 
humbler order of schools are in connection with two great rival societies â€” the BritisI 
and Foreign, and the National, both of whose head establishments are in London. Be 
cently, an annual irrant has been made by Parliament, to enable the privy-eouncil to en 
couri^ elemente?lL<xuÂ«tion in .udxlschook as xdU submit to i:^S^i^ of Â« 
inspector. In the year ending Oct. 31 , 1851, 2,310 schools were actually inspected, an 
thus entitled themselves to share in the ^rant. They included 1,713 Church of Â£n^lan< 
schools, in England and Wales ; 282 Protestant Dissenting schools, in England aÂ» 
Wales ; 98 Roman Catholic schools, in Great Britain ; and 217 Presbyterian schools^ i] 
Scotland, of which 91 were of the Free Church. Acccmmiodation was aff<Â»ded, in tbcs 
schools, for 299,425 scholars ; and the average number in attendance was 271,126. Tb 
total yearly expenditure was jÂ£213,927 ; the total income was ^204,243 ; of vrhid 
jÂ£34,039 was paid by the scholars, and JE86,999 was raised by local subscriptiom an 
collections. Religious sectarian differences have, as yet, frustrated every other step tawaid 
the establishment of a national system of education* Above a third of the adult mak 
of England are unable to sign their names, and near a fourtti can neither read nor wiiti 

The chief educational establishment in Ireland is Trinity College, in DnUin ; Imt t 
tbis only members of the Churdi of England are admitted. There have lately been eatet 
Ushed Queen's University Colleges at Bellast, Cork, and GkJw^, under the patvoaag 
of the government, and open to all without distinction of sebt There are aleo other ed 
legiate institutiona at Carlow, Kilkenny, Thuries, and BeUiast. Ms^noeth CoHage is a 
ecclesiastical school endowed by the Btate, in Â£avor of the CathoUcs. In 1831 there vn

^which is an arrangement by which the children ajre sepaiated, at certain times^ and teaght 
religion by their respective pastors-^ the necessary rands being provided by the State. 
By this means it was hoped that the ^reat bodv <^ the people, and more particularly the 
children of the poorer class of Catholics, woula a); length be brought within the pale of 
education. The national board consists of nine commissioner& chosen from both tibe 
Roman Catholic and Protestant bodies-^ the Roman Catholic and Protestant aichbidi- 
ops of Dublin being among the number. The comnussioners receive from the praUic 

{>arse, and expend annually, the sum of Â£50,000. But these schools as well as the col- 
efi;es just mentioned, have eneountered great opposition from the zealots of all sects, 
who prefer to have tb^ people uneducated rather than not have their own creed taught. 
Besides this great national system . of elementary instruotioo, the oountary possesses 
several reli^ous or charitable associations for promoting education among the pocmw 
classes : of these the principal are the Kildare Place Society, and the Church Eduoatitm 
Society. The Roman Catholic body also supports a considerable number of schoola.

Scotland possesses five colles^es or universities for the higher branches of instruction : 
being those of Glasgow, St Andrew's, King's College, and Mareschal College, Aber- 
deen, and Edinburgh. Education at these institutions is generally conferred on a more 
liberal and less expensive scale than at the universities of Bngland. Scotland has been 
long distinguished for its parochial institutions for elementary instruction, and also for its 
grammar-schools or academies in the chief towns, which serve as preparatory gymnasia 
KMT the universities. &ach parish (some parishes in towns excepted) is provided with 
a Bobool at the expense of certain land-owners or heritors, in virtue of an act of Parlia- 
ment passed in 1696, re-enacting statutes formerly in existence. Within the last 40 
years, the parish schools have been almost superseded in some quarters by the establish- 
ment of voluntarily-supported institutions, better suited to the wants of the age. 

In a report to Parliament, the number of schools in Scotland was stated as follows : ^ 
Parochial schools, 1,047 ; pupils attending them, 68,293 ; total emoluments of teachersi 
\ Â£SS^SSd. Voluntarily-supported schools, 3,995 ; pupils attending them 151,160. It ap- 
I pewrs from this that there were 219,453 children receiving instruction, (not including the 
f attendance of Sunday Schools,) and that of these only 68,293, or a litUe more than one- 
I fourth, were educated at the parochial schools. There are 5,042 schools, and of these 
t only 1,047, or about one-fifth, were parochial establishments. The publication of this re- 
i port caused considerable surprise, for it was generally believed that the great bulk of .the 
p luvenile population were instructed in the pariah schooK A great difference was found 
bet99^0en the attendance of males and fiemales. Taking the entire attenc^ce on the 



t

schools, there were 132/189 males, 89,964 females. The result of the inqniiy seems to be, 
that abont one in nine of the population in Scotland attends school 

Poor Laws* Pauperism and distress exist constantly in the United Kingdom, to so^ 
an alarming extent tnat the subject of the poor-laws has become one of t^e most ab- 
sorbing interest The English poor-laws may be divided into three classes : the fizst,â‚¬i- 
tending from the middle of the reign of Edward TIL to the end of Ihat of EUizabeth ; tk 
second, from the death of Elizabeth to the middle of the last century ; and the tbird, 
from the middle of the last century to the year 1834, when the Poor- Law Amendmes 
Act was passed, by which the management of pauperism was placed upon an entirdj 
new system. The poor-laws of the most ancient period appear to have been notbkg 
more than parts of a systematic attempt to restore the old feudal institution of villanage, 
by confining the laborers to their parishes, and forcing them to work there for such wages 
as their masters chose to allow them. This attempt, however, completely, failed of ite 
oWect. During the second period, the object of the laws was to relieve the impotent and 
innrm pauper, only ; the able-bodied being considered subject to the provisions, not of 
the poor-laws, but of the vagrant acts. During this period the laws appear to have beea 
successful. During the third period, the object of the laws was to provide the destitote 
laborer with a comfortable subsistence at his own home, whatever might be his chaiacta 
and conduct, and whatever the value of his labor. This attempt succeeded in those parts 
of the kingdom which have received the name of the pauperized districts,^ and placed tbe 
laborer in the condition, physically and morally, of a slave. He was confined to his |w- 
ish, maintained according to his wants, not to the value of his services, restrained froQ 
misconduct by no fear of loss, and therefore not stimulated to industry and activity bj 
any hope of reward. 

The present system, established by the Poor-Law Amendment Act in Sn^knd and 
recently introduced into Ireland also, provides for the creation of a Central jBoard of 
Commissioners, who have the whole administration of affairs for the relief of the poet 
These commisioners ms&e all rules, orders, and. regulations for the management of pai> 
pers, the government of work-houses, the guidance and control of guardians, vestries an! 
salaried officers. They are also empowered to carry the act into effect in all other re- 
spects, as they think proper, except that they are not allowed to administer relief by in- 
terference with any individual case. To enable the Central Board to adapt their nda 
to the varying circumstances of the 16,000 parishes over which they preside, and to sa- 
perintend their execution, they appoint assistant commissioners, each itinerant within his 
own district. This system made no direct change, either in the nature or amount of the 
relief to be given, or in the persons entitled to it. It legalizes neither allowance norI^ 
lief, without labor ; but contains no enactments prohibiting them, or declaring their ilk* 

e. The Commissioners began their labor by uniting and organizing the parishes 
have now created 607 unions of parishes administered by guardians. Tliere re- 
main 490 parishes unorganized on account of legal difficulties. One of the eailiet 
regulations was the prohibition of pecuniary relief, in common cases, to individnals out 
of the work-houses and in good hesdth. By this operation, many of the most sctoos 
evils of the old system were extirpated, and the laborers have been raised from a state of 
servitude to freedom. The taxation for the support of the poor has also been lessened 
In 1834 the poor rates amounted to Â£7,511,219. In 1840 they were diminished to jÂ£5,- 
110,683, and they are now somewhat less. The success of the new system has not been 
confined to this pecuniary saving. The morals of the laboring dasses have been im- 
proved, and their activity and industry stimulated. The laborer, finding himself no long- 
er entitled to a fixed income, whatever may be his idleness or misconduct, and no longer 
restricted to that income, whatever maybe his industry and integrity, becomes stimul^^ 
to activity and honesty by the double motive of hope and fear. 

On the Ist of Jan., 1852, the total number of persons in England and Wales, recw- 
ing relief, was (exclusive of the 490 unorganized parishes) 132,269, of whom 18,869 woe 
in the work-houses. The total number who had received relief during the year pieri- 
ous was 835,360. 

The whole number relieved in Ireland, which is divided into 163 unions, during the 
year ending Sept 29, 1851, v^as 706,378 in the woric houses, and 49,079 out of tb^ at

s>ti 1 expense of Â£1^02j87S. The total number of inmates in the work-houses, Jaft. 
t 18 i3, was 168^. There were accommodations for 288,860. 

In the year ending May 14, 1861, the expenditure for the relief of the poor in Scot- 
$nd was jÂ£535,942. The ntimber relieved, including 43,093 cases of casual relief; was 
. 11 ^0. There are 881 parishes in Scotlandi of which 653 are assessed, and 228 support 
.h^rpoa )y voluntary contributions. 

Bighd fs. In the. year ending Maxch 25, 1850, there was raised in England and 
"Wales fd .; ^lighways by rates and labor performed in lieu of .rates, ^1,902,004. The to-

Mami^wre$. The manufactures of Ghreat Britain surpass in extent and variety 
t}x)se of any other country; and firom the supmor character of its maehineiy, the econ- 
ooiizing of timr, and the' refined skill of its workmen, are generally produced at a lower 
r&teÂ» an J of be^-^r quality, than in countries more favorably s^ituated with respect to the 
/rodudion of Aw matenals. 

The cattoni nanufactwre is the most extensive of the whole, both with respect to the 
capital which \\ involves^ and the number of people to whom it gives employment ; it is 
supposed to form, one-fourth part of the total industry of Britain. The number of work* 
people in its various departments (reckoning spinners, weavers, bleachers, etc ; engineers, 
sndthsi and others engaged in tiie works,) is estimated at 1,700,000. The capital enÂ« 
ga^ed in this krge branch of manufaeture at present* is reckoned at about iS40,000,000y 
and the total Tilue of the goods annually produced is believed to be between jÂ£35,000,- 
OOO and jÂ£40,000,000. The mw material, or cotton wool, is brought chiefly firom Ameri* 
ca, and a part also from the East Indies and Eflypt 

The Woollen Manufacture was earliest estabUshed in England ; it gives employment to 
above half a million of people. The goods manufactured are valued at Â£20,000,000 ; 
the finer qualities of the mw material are imported firom Oermanv, or firom Australia; 
the coarser are produced at home. This manufacture, particulauy the fin^ kinds, is 
chiefly carried on in the west and north of England. 

The Silk Manufacture has been carried on for a long period, having* been inlaroduced 
in the fifteenth century by emigrants firom France. The quantity of silk for working, 
annually imported, is about three and a half millions of pounds. The consumption of 
silk ffoods at home is large. The annual produce of the manufacture is now estimated 
at Â£10,000,000 ; and it is supposed to give employment to about 300,000 work-people. 

The Leather Manufacture i& of special importance. The value of the diflerent arti- 
des of which it forms the material, is estimated at Â£20,000,000 ; this includes glove^ 
saddlery, boots and shoes, etc. The increase of this trade in late years has been very 
great; hidea are imported fix>m all quarters of the world, and the quantity has doubled 
^thin a few years. 

irony Cutlery y and Hardware^ forms one of the manufactures in which Britain particu- 
larly excels. The abundance of her mines of iron, copper, tin, lead, and coal, and the 
easy access which can be had to them at all points by sea, river, and railroad, give facil- 
ities which are possessed by no other country. The annual value of the manufactured 
fi[Oods is estimated to be above Â£26,000,000, and employment is given to 420,000 men 
in the working of copper, Inrass, pewter, steel, tin, and other metals. 

The Earthenware^ Cfhina^ and Glass Manufactures rank next to those we have meo- 
tioned. The annual value of tiie glass manuihctiired is about four and a half millions, 
and that of the potteir and earthenware about three and a half. 

The whole value of manufieuctures of all kinds produced annually in Great Britain, 
ia reckoned to be upwards of Â£200,000,000. Thdr production is limited almost entirely to 
the island of Great Britain. The only considerable manufacture of Ireland is that of 
linen, the flax for which is grown on the island ; but even this manufacture is chiefly con- 
fined to the northern part 

Ei-ports. The export commerce of Great Britain consists almost entirelv in the tran* 
sport of the:ie various articles of manufacture to all the countries in the world which i^ve 
anythinff to give in exchange.

Roadsy CafuUsj and Railwaps.'^ Cormeded intimately with tiie oommerce and mamh 
facturing industry of the country, is the immense facility of internal communication whkh 
the United Kingdom possesses, and which is so pecnharly a feature in British enterptize. 
Railroads, canals, and turnpike roads traverse, in every direction, the whole surface of the 
land. These works attesl^ most obviously, the activity, the power, and resources of the 
nation. The length of turnpike roads is, in Great Britain, about 25,000 miles, and in 
Ireland 14,000 miles. The total length of canals is nearly 3,000 miles, the income of 
which amounts to about JS 15,000,000 per annum; which sum, after deducting the ex- 
penses of repairs, etc., pays an interest on investments of between 5 and 6 per cent 

The net of railways which now band together the various parts of Great Britain and 
Ireland, extends to an enormous length. In 1845, there was open to traffic 2418 miks, 
and in the same year 300 miles more were completed. In 1846, there were 698 miles, 
and in 1847, 839 miles opened, making an aggregate of 3,850 miles in the whole kingdom; 
the capital invested being X 109,628,800. In 1847, the construction of 1,408 miles addi- 
tional was authorized, and during the subsequent four sessions of Parliament, an aggre* 
gate of 9,732 miles. On 1st July, 1848, 4,357 j- miles were completed. On the 30th of 
June, 1850, there were 6,308 miles of railroads open for traffic in the United Sjngdom, 
having 2,030 stations, and emploving 60,325 persons, giving 1 station and 28 officiak and 
servants to every three miles, "f here were, at the same time, 864 miles in progress of con- 
struction, on which 58,884 persons were employed. During the year, 625 miles were 
opened, and the total length completed at the beginning of 1851, was 6,621 miles ; d 
which 5,132 were in England and Wales, 951 were in Scotiand, and 538 in Ireland. 

The average cost, per mile, of all the railroads constructed in Ghreat Britain, is about 
$175,000. 

The Railroads insure passengers against accidents, both on periodical and single- 
journey 'tickets. Nearly all the Companies now afford facilities for carrying out the 
principle. 

The increase in the lines of railroad, during 1851, was not so great as in aByooe of 
the preceding years since 1844. The maximum increase was in 1848, when 1182 miles 
were added to the pre-existing lines. Since 1848, the increase has been^diBunishiiig.

It appears that the number of passenger? travelling on railroads in England and Wales, 
which, in 1850, amounted to 58,514,435^ reached 70,471,179 in 1851, showing an increase 
of 20 per cent ; while the receipts from those passengers rose from <Â£5,888,603 to 
Â£6,952,613, being an increase of 18 per cent. The mean length of raihroad upon which 
this traffic was conducted had increased, in the same period, only 6.6 per cent. This in- 
crease is, in a great measure, to be attributed to the vast facilities for travelling afforded 
to the public by means of excursion-trains, which in 1850 had received a great impulse, 
but was developed in an extraordinary degree in the year 1851, during the exhibition. 
The mean length of railroad open for traffic in Scotland, during the year, has increased 
6.2 per cent, while the number of passengers has only increased from 8,844,191 to 
9,236,313, or 4.9 per cent, and the receipts from them from Â£600,082 to Â£622,649, or 
3.7 per cent The mean length of railroad, open for traffic in Ireland during the year, baa 
increased 12^ per cent, while the number of passengers conveyed has only increased fit)m 
6,465,796 to 5,633,603 or 2.5 pr. ct ; the receipts from them having risen from Â£339,076 
to Â£365,603, or 7.8 per cent In England and Wales, the receipts for goods have risen 
trom Â£5,480,771 to Â£6,044,183 or 10.3 per cent ; in Scotland, from Â£721,176 to Â£814,053, 
or 12.8 per cent ; in Ireland, from Â£174,959 to Â£198,459, or 13.4 per cent The general 
results of traffic, over all the United Kingdom, show that the ag^mte number of pas- 
sengers, conveyed in 1850, amounted to 72,854,422 ; in 1851, to 85,391,095, being an in- 
crease of 12,536,673, or 17.2 per cent The gross receipts from passengers, in 1860, 
amounted to Â£6,827,761; in 1851, to Â£7,940,7^, showing an increase of Â£1,114,003, or 
16.3 per cent The gross sum received for transportation of goods amounted, in 1850, to 
Â£6,376,907, and in 1851 to Â£7,056,695, showing an increase of Â£679,788, or 10.6 per 
cent The gross revenue of all the railroads, arising from traffic of all descriptions, 
which in 1850 amounted to Â£13,204,668, amounted, in 1851, to Â£14,997,459, or very 
nearly Â£15,000,000, showing an increase of Â£1,792,791, or 13.5 per cent 

The number of persons employed, on the 30th of June, 1851, was 106,601. At the 
end of 1850, railroad companies had raised, by shares and loans, a sum of Â£240,270,746 
sterling. 

Telegraphs. â€” There were, in October, 1852, upwards of 300 raihroad stations pro- 
vided with telegraphic apparatus. The length of the telegraph, to connect these sta- 
tions, was 3^00 miles, to which additions were every day made. Most of the lines be- 
long to the Electric Telegraph Company ; but a new and novel company, called the 
British Electric Telegraph Company, has been lately started. 

In September, 1851, a submarine Telegraph was laid down from the South Foreland 
in England to the French coast, near Calais. On the English side it is connected with 
the telegraph of the South-Eastern Railroad, at Dover ; aiid, on the French side, at Calais, 
with the North of France Railroad telegraph, thus opening a direct telegraphic commu- 
nication between London and Paris, Brussels, Berlin, Hamburg, Dresden, Munich, Vi- 
enna, Breda, Venice, and Milan. The submarine telegraph is inclosed in a cable pre- 
pared for the purpose. It consists of four copper wires, each intended to act separately 
&om th3 others in transmitting signals. These wires are separately enveloped in a 
gutta percha coating, and a sinular coating encircles the whole. This ca^e is next bound 
round closely with yarn steeped in a melted mixture of tar and tallow, exterior to which 
is a tight spiral sheathing composed of ten galvanized iron wires, each rather more than 
a quarter of an inch thick. The whole weighs about 180 tons, and is 24 miles long. 
In May, 1852, a similar cable, but of smaller size, weighing about a ton a mile, was laid 
down across the Irish Sea, from Holyhead to Howth near Dublin, a distance of about

There exists no official record of the population of England previous to the com- 
mencement of the present century. The first enumeration of the population of Ireland 
was made in 1813 ; but so imperfectly was the work accomplished, that English statists 
place no reliance on the correctness of the returns, and make no use of them as the 
basis of calculation, so that the only tables upon which we can base statements with 
reference to the progress of Ireland, from time to time, must be made with reference to 
the termination of each ten years, ending in 1831, 1841, and 1851. The first census c^ 
Great Britain was taken in 1801, at which date the population amounted to 10,567, 893. 

By the census of 1841, the population of Great Britain and the islands of Jersey, Guern- 
sey, and Man, amounted to 18,658,372. During each ten years from 1801 to 1851 the actual 
increase was as follows: â€” viz. 1,479^662; 2,132,896; 2,184,542; 2,260,749; 2,227,433, 
being at the rate of 14, 18, 15, 14 and 12 per cent, respectively. The actual increase of 
the population in fifty years has been 10,317,917; the rate per cent in fifty years, 98; 
the annual rate per cent being 1.37. ^ 

With respect to Ireland and the returns of 1821, the number of inhabitants at tiiat pe- 
riod was, 6,801,827. In 1831, 7,767,401â€” increase 966,574 ; rate per cent 14, la In 
1841, 8,175,124 â€” increase 407,723 ; rate per cent 5, 25. In 1851, 6,515,794 ; decrease 
1,659,330 ; rate per cent 20. By this statement we perceive that the population of Ire- 
land increased from 1821 to 1841 at the average rate of about one per cent per annum, 
while a decrease of 1,659,330, from 1841 to 1851, indicates a most appalling diminution 
of population amounting to two per cent per annum, or 20 per cent for the entire tea 
years, a reduction amounting to the total emigration, frt)m the whole United Kingdom, 
firom 1839 to 1850. 

The contemplation of such a state of affairs is the more melancholy, when vsre ctm- 
sider that the great diminution of population in place of being equalized through the 
period of ten years must have occurred mainly within one or two years ; a reduction of 
population sinking the number of people to a lower point than it was in 1821, when the 
first census of Ireland was taken ; and it would appear in still stronger light if we were 
to calculate the natural progress the population would have made up to 1846, the year 
of famine, and estimate what should be the present population if no unnatural caisse 
had operated to reduce it 

The decrease extended to no less than 31 counties and cities, and varied fit>m 9 to 31 
per cent ; while the only increase which occurred was confined to 9 towns and cities, ta 
which many probably fled to find relief. 

These startling and appalling facts proclaim the reality of the sufferings experienced 
from the famine in Ireland ; and it is some consolation to feel that our distance did not 
preclude those efforts in her l?ehalf by our own citizens and government, without which 
the desolation would have been even more strongly marked. 

Dnring ten years, the population of the entire kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland 
iiMTe^sed from 26,838,496 to 27,452,262, or at the rate of a littie more than half a mil- 
lion in ten years. In the last fifty years, Englsmd and Wales increased 102 per ce&t, 



ENGLAND AND WALEa 117 

(mdes 105, females 97 50) ; Scotland 78 p^ cent, (males 84, females 73). The popn^ 
lation of the United States, doling the past fifty years, has increased at the rate of 337 
per cent, and in ten years intervening between the two last censuses, increased from sev- 
enteen and a fraction millions to over twenty-three millions, or 36 per centum. During 
the same period (leaving Ireland out of view), the population of Great Britain increased 
at the rate of 13 per cent, during 10 years, or 1.2l per cent, per annum. 



IV. ENGLAND AND WALES. 

Extent. â€” England occupies the southern' portion of the island of Ghreat Britain, and 
forms geographically, as well as soci^y and politically, the principal division of the 
United Kingdom. On the north, the only direction in which it is not surrounded by the 
sea, it is divided from Scotland by a series of rivers and a chain of mountains. The 
greatest length, from Lizard's Point in Cornwall to Berwick-upon-Tweed, is about 400 
miles ; and the greatest breadth, from St David's Head, Pembrokeshire, to the east coast 
of Essex, is 300 miles. The area has been variously computed at 50,387 and 57,960 
square miles, of which only one-fourth part is uncultivated. 

The principaltiy of Wales (area, 7,263 square miles; population, about 1,000,000) com- 
prises that part of the English west coast situated between Bristol and Liverpool. It is 
inhabited by descendants of the ancient Britons, and continued to be an independent 
kingdom for several centuries, until, in 1282, it was subdued by the English king Edp 
ward I. Since the vear 1536, it has permanently been united with England. The eld- 
est son of the sovereign of England, is styled Prince of Wales. Most of the people talk the 
Welsh language. 

The isle of Man (224 square miles and 52,000 inhabitants), belonging to England, 
but not to any English county, lies in the Irish Sea, at about equal distance from each 
of the three united kingdoms. Its natives are called Ma/nxmetij and their language is 
very similar to that of the native Irish. Their ancestors were subdued, in the 10th cen- 
tury, by the Danes, and in the 11th by the Normans (from Normandy). In the 13th 
century the Scotch, and in the 14th the English conquered the island, with which, in the 
15th century, the earls of Derby were invested, and since styled kings. In the 16th cen- 
tury, however^ the duke of Athol became possessed of the island ; which, in 1765, was 
purchased by the British government, in order to put an end to the smuggling which was 
carried on here upon the largest scale. The capital of the island is Qutlet&n^ on the 
southern coast, with 3,000 inhabitants. It was formerly called Sodor. The residence 
of the ancient kings of Man was in Castle Rushen. The most important town of the isle 
is DovglaSy residence of a bishop, with 7,000 inhabitants. Another town is Ramsa^j with 
2,000 inhabitants. 

The Norman hUmds (total area, 266 square miles ; total population, 90,000,) situ- 
ated in the English Channel, near the French coast, are the only possession left to the 
English of what they formerly had wrested from France. They have a mild climate 
and a fertile soil, and are the following ! 1. Jersey (149 square miles, and 57,000 in- 
habitants), containing, among others, the towns of St. HeKer^ with 22,000 inhabitants^ 
and St. Atibin, with ^,000 inhabitants. 2. Guernsey (96 sq. miles and 34,000 inhabi- 
tants), containing, among others, St. Pierre^ with 20,000 inhabitants. 3. Ajlberney, or 
Avrigny (16 sq. miles and 4,000 inhabitants), containing ihe borough of the same name, 
"With 1,000 inhabitants. 4. Sark (5 sq. miles and 1,000 inhabitants), is in French called 
Cers^ or Sereg, and contains the fortified seaport of Longy. 

Surface and Soil â€” England is generally a level or undulating country. In the north 
and east coast, some mountains traverse the surface in several directions ; in the south, 
there are no considerable elevations, the hills only serve to diversify the country, and give 
it that picturesque outline for which it is noted. The greatest part of the Scottish bor* 
der is formed by the Cheviot HtllSj a chain of considerable elevation, and from which a 
range, varying from 1,200 to 3,000 feet, diverges southward, through Cumberland, York- 
shire, and Lancashire, to the middle of Derbyshire. This chain forms the wat^sbed of 



118 ENGLAND AND WALES. 

the north country. Connected with this, but almost separated from it by the valleys offte 
Eden and the Lnne, is a lofty group of mountains, which cover a great portion of Wejt^ 
moreland and Cumberland, where Scattfell^ Helvellyn^ Skiddaw, and Bowfell rise, T^ 
spectively, to 3466, 3,055, 3,022, and 2,911 feet above the level of the ocean. He second 
great watershed of the country is formed by a range of table-lands, rising sometimes into 
hills, and extending, in a tortuous line, through the East Riding of Yoriuhire, and the 
eountiea of Lincoln, Northampton, Oxford, Gloucester, Somerset and Dqrset ; where it 
terminates at the islands of Portland and PurbecL It is chiefly composed of oolitic rods, 
rifling above a lias formation* and presents generally a bold escarpment io the west, vitk 
a regular slope to the east This range forms the Votsmold^ Mendipy QimrUock and Bmh 
dan hills, in the last of which Dunkerry Beapon, one of the highest summits ia the we^ 
of England, rises to the height of 1660 feet The Chalk Hills, which traverse the sob^I 
and east, diverge from Salisbury Plain. One o^these extends through Hampshire sad 
Sussex to Beachy Head, forming the " South Downs ; "a second extends, in neariy tkf 
same direction, through Hampshire, Surrey, and Kent, and forms the " North Doimf 
while the third and most important range pursues a north-easterly direction, and form 
the eastern border of the "JFVn*.'* The south-western counties are occupied with toom- 
takis of granitic fomration, sometimes called the Devonian range, the principal chaii of 
which extends from the Vale of Exeter to the Land's End. Wales is occufMed bj^ Â« sys- 
tem of high and rugged mountains, which constitute several groups and chains, aiid \siet' 
sect the country in various directions, between the Bristol Channel and the Irirfi 8a 
The highest and most broken part of England is found near itd western coast, while tk 
principal plains and lowlands slope towards the German Ocean. 

Besides the moorlands which cover a large portion of the mountain districts, there Â» 
other tradÂ» of that description which deserve notioe. The eastern mooriaods in the North 
Riding of Yorkshire, 30 miles in length, and 20 in breadth, consist chiefly of stony liilk 
and peat mosses, with a cold and ungenial climate. There are, however, even in to 

' tract, some fertile and wdl cultivated dales. The Staffordshire moorlands occupy tk 
northern portion of the county, at an elevation of 500 to 1164 feet, and are of vtriow 
â€¢quality and aspect Dartmoor y in Devonshire, covers a space of from 200,000 to 300^ 
acres, at a mean elevation of 1,700 feet. Its surface is extremely ragged, and the scfl, 
eoteried with fragmentary rock, is thin and poor. This was the site of the famous nal- 
tary fHrison, in which so many American prisoners were confined. In the highest part of 
the moor there is a morass of about 80,000 acres. In the vtrestem part of^^raaerset^ 
is EocmooTy a tract of about 20,000 actes, which is mostiy waste and iireelalmable, bit 
produces a smaU hardy breed of horses, and affords pasture to about 20^000 sheep of t 
peculiar breed, to whion it gives its name. Besides these hilly moorlands, there tre Â«â€¢ 
tensive heaths in England, princif^ally in Surrey, Herts, and ^Dorset, which eoDsiBt of 
enceedingly poor land, and are generally flat and uninterdsting. 

These ranges of mountains, hills, and moorlands divide the country into a great vari- 
ety of plains aad valleys, which are traversed by rivers and streamlets, few of which arc 
naturally navigable. A few of the more interesting of these districts may be ennnEierated. 
The Vale of York may justly be regarded els the principal river-vale <rf the island. It ex- 
tends about 60 mUes in length and 15 in breadth, and contains an area of 1,000 square 
miles. Holdemess, lying between the Humber and the sea, is a plain with a low hot no- 
delating surface, of about 270,000 acres. The city of Carlisle is placed in the centre of a 
large pfein of 300,000 aicres. The Vale of the Sevem^ one of the most fertile districts in 
England, extends through Gloucestershire and Worcestershire, for 40 miles. The Vakef 
Exeter contains 200 square itiiles ; and the Vaie of Tatmtony about one half the extent, 
produces the finest crops and fruits, and enjoys a particularly mild climate. Between the 
North and South Downs is the Weald of Kent, Surrey, and Sussex, a level tract of 1^ 
square lailes. The Fens form a level tract of about 400,000 acres of very low, marshy 
lands, lying around the Wash, principally in Cambridge and Lincoln, but partly also ifl 

. Northampton, Norfolk, Sufiblk, and Huntingdon. lUmney Marshy in KentÂ» ia connect^ 
with the Welland, Denge, and Guilford Marshes, in Surrey, which together form a tiact 
of dO.OOO adea, the greatar part of which is rich and productive. The marshes of Some^ 
se^Bhire we likewise of considerable extent and importance. These lie along the Bristol

ire not surpassed by any in the kingdom. ScMsbwry Pbm euid Marhoravgk Datims are 
ilso important tracts. But the largest plain in England is that which extends firom the 
Thames north-eastward, through Essex, Suffolk, and Norfolk, comprehending nearly the 
ffrhole of these counties, with a considerable portion of those bordering upon them to the 
9rest 

The great south-east division of England, in whidi a comparatively level surfiekce pre* 
rails, exhibits a soil which is either chieny chalky, or chiefly clayey, according to the cnav- 
icter of the substratum. Interspersed are a few sandy tracts, of which Boffshot Heath 
aiay be cited as an example. In the mountainous districts, tiie usual light soil, resnhiim 
Srom the early rocks, prevails, excepting where, in the north, there has been a peaty adt 
Qiixture. Upon the whole, England may be said to possess a large proportion of good 
ind productive soil Probably not above one-ninth of the entire surface (Wales being in* 
eluded) is unsusceptible of tillage. 

Scenery. â€” The natural scenery of England is genemlly <>f a pleasing, rather than of a 
aprand or picturesque character ; yet there are some portions of the country which are oon- 
lidered attractive on account of their romantic beauty. 

The south-west part of the county of Cumberland and the north-west part of West- 
inoreland, comprehend a range of loftv mountains : Skiddaw, Saddleback, Helvellyn, and 
K>me others of scarcely less note, amiast which lie the lakes for which this district of Eog^ 
and has long been celebrated. The largest of these are UUswaterj Thirlrnere^ Derwettt^ 
)oaier^ and SassenthioaUe. 

The combination of alpine wildness and grandeur with tiie soft scenery which repoaea 
ii dothed slope and mirror-like lake at the bottoms of the hills, is vrhQ,t gives tiie CamÂ« 
[>erland scenery its principal charm. 

The lake scenery of Cumberland has, by its beauty, attracted a great number of per* 
nanent re^dents, whose villas enter pleasingly into its landscapes. 

The termination of the great northern range in the north of Derbyshire presents, in that 
iistnct, a odlection of rugged hills and narrow valleys, amidst which some of the moet 
romantic scenery in England is to be found. A particular portion of it, near the village 
!>f Castleton, is termed tiie Peak Scenery, from a particular eminence or peak whidi at^ 
traets more than usual attention. 

The Peak is approached through a rude and savage pass, named Whiyats (gates of tiie 
Blinds), flanked with precipices 1,000 feet high. It is a limestone mountain, and perfo* 
fated, as mountains of that kind oÂ£ rock often are, with an immense cave. On the top 
lie perched the remains of a castle, once the residence of a feimily descended from Win* 
iam Peveril, a natural son of the Conqueror. In the precipice below, above 600 feet from 
the top, is the entrance of the cave, a flattish Gothic arch, 120 feet wide and 46 in height 
Within this arch the cavern recedes about 90 feet Other passages and expansions sue* 
Â»ed, till the cave ceases to be passable at the distance of 2,300 feet from the opening. 

The scenery adjacent to the neighboring town of Buxton is also much celebrated. 
One of the most noted objects is ElderCs Bole^ a perpendicular opening, down which a 
ine has been dropped to the extent of 2,652 feet without finding the bottom. Poolers Hole 
[0 a cave remarkable for its magnificent stalactites. 

The IsLB OF Wight, situated off the coast of Hampshire, and measuring twenty-^Uuiee 
tniles by about thirteen, is celebrated both for its mild climate and its beautiful scenery. 
The south shore is the most noted for its romantic objects, the most remarkable of which 
is at Undercliff. Here a ^eat chalk cliff has, at one time, been presented to the sea ; but, 
ifterwards undermined by the action of the waves, a large portion of it has fallen for- 
Qvard in vast fragments, leaving a new cliff at the distance of about half a mile from the 
shore. In the interval between the beach and the cliff, the fragments axe scattered in eon- 
fusion, many of them forming eminences of the most picturesque forms, while the inter- 
uediate spaces afford room for cottages and villas, and even, at one place, for a small 
ising town, nestling amidst the most beautiful shrubbery, natural and artificial. This 
lislrict, when view^ from the sea, appears a series of gigantic steps, rising from the 
>each, towards a great perpendicular walL

est degree important The IXawwf, which 
is formed by the Lech, Colne, Thame,

GeoU^ â€” Coalfieldt. The Borface of Enriand iDclndefl Bpecimens of the whole ex- 
tent of the series of rocks, from the primary, which are found in the ranges of monntains 
on the west, to the lowest of the tertiary, which compose several districts in the aoath- 
east ; strata intermediate to ^ese divisions being found in BucceBsion, in proceeding 
from the west and north towards the east and south. 

In Cornwall and Devonshire eminences of granite, serpentine, and feldspar-poTphyry 
occur, while the slopes resting on them are composed of difierent kinds of slate. The 
granite of this district is extensively used for paving in London, though .considered len 
bard and durable than that brought from Scotland. TThe Welsh mountains are composed 
cbieAy of varieties of slate, with some intermixture of volcanic rocks, as basalt and trap. 
A rich coal-field, one bundled miles in length and from five to ten in breadth, rests upon 
theb southern verge, extending from Glamorgan into PemtHvkeshire, being the largest 
coal-fieid in Great Britain. The northern range of mountains is also chiefly composed of 
Blate rocka. 

Between these ranges of mountains and a line drawn from Exmouth, through Bath, 

Gloucester, Leicester, Nottingham, and Tadca8ter,to Stockton-npon-Tees, the surface is 

composed of the lower Becondary strata, including rich beds of coaJ, the existence of which 

in this situation is mainly what has enabled England to become the first manufacturing 

country in the world. The eastern parts of the coanties of Durham and NortbnmbertaiHl, 

from the Tees northward to Berwick, form a peculiarly valuable coal-field, of nnniennE 

beds, fi^m which the metropolis and other cities in the east of England and elsewfaen 

are supplied with this impcnrtant mineral. Another coal<field of great value, and that upon 

which the manufactures of Manchester depend, extends 

northwards from Macclesfield to Oldham, and thence 

westward to Prescot, near Liverpool. A coal-field near 

Wolverhampton, in Staffordshire, is the most valuable 

in the centre of England ; upon it depend the extensive 

metallic manufactures of Birmingham. 

To the east of the line drawn from Exmouth to Batii, 
and thence by Gloucester, Leicester, and Tadcaster, to 
Stockton-upon-Tees, we find the upper rocks of the seo- 
ondary formation, presenting in succession red sand-

"iSineraU â€” Next in importance to ooal, as a minenlftrodact, is iron, which is exten- 



ENGLAND AND WALES. 12S 

aively dlfTiieed throughout England, though chiefly wronght in the neighborhood' of coaL 
on account of that fuel being required for smelting it. This valuable metal is produced 
in South Waleo to a vast amount The chief other districts where it is wrought are Staf- 
fordshire, Worceatershire, and Yorkshire. In an account of the mineral productions of 
England, it would be improper to overlook its clay, so extensively used in the manufac- 
ture of pottery, (chiefly in Staffordshire), and in making bricks and tiles for building. 

Tiu-oie, contajning about three parts metal out of four, is found in thick veins or ver- 
tical beds in the granite of CornwaU, where it has been wrought since before the conquest 
of the counlzy by the Romans. Copper-ore is also found extensively in that district, 
generally in continuation of veins which, in the upper parts, have been composed of tin- 
ore ; and in several of the same veins lead, zinc, and antimony are found. 

Climate, â€” The climate of England ia remarkable for its exemption from extremes of 
heat and cold. It displays an uncommon amount of variation within a narrow range. 
' l^e average temperature in winter is about 42 deg. of Fahrenheit ; in summer, the day- 
temperature is generally about 62 deg. It is only on rare occasions that the thermometer 
reaches 80 deg., or sinks below 20 deg. The neighborhood of the sea, which partly ac- 
roonts for this moderation, ia also the cause why the climate of England is more humid 
than is usual in continental countries of similar latitude. Being inclined to cold and 
damp, it is more favorable to the growth than to the ripening of vegetable productions. 
It is certainly not unfavorable to either the physical or moral condition of the people. 
Devonshire and some adjacent districts on the southern coast, enjoy a temperature which 
in winter is, at an average, two, three, four, and even in some instances five degrees 
above the rest ; and these distctcta are therefore recommended for the residence of persons 
afflicted by pulmonary disease. 

Vegetable Products. â€” The most conspicuous feature in the botany of England is the 
fresh and luxuriant herbage, resulting from the humidity of the climate, and which, though 
apt to Ije overlooked by^e natives from familiarity, never fails to strike the minds of for- 
ei^ern with surprise. 

Much of the surface was formerly under wood ; hot this has, for ages, been chiefly 
confined to particular foreata, to the neighborhood of great mansions, and the enclosures 
of fields. Several large royal forests still exist in England, the most considerable being 
JVew Forest in Haup^ire ^66,942 acres) and Dean Forest in Gloucestershire (23,015 
acres). That of Windsor, tuough famed from its situation and the poetry of Pope, is 
macfa smaller, being only 4,402 acres. These were anciently the scenes of courtly sport, 

but are now in part reduced 
to cultivation, or reserved 
for the production of timber 
to.be used for the public ser- 
vice. The parks around the 
seats <^ the nobility and 
gentry are a peculiar and 
most inviting feature of 
the English landscape. 
*' Tame deer are kept in them. 

A mixture of green open 
glades with masses of old 
well-grown timber â€” they 
are scenes of great sylvan 
bean^ ; while the existence 
of BO much pleasure-reserv- 
ed ground in a country 
where nearly every acre 
would be profitable under 
tillage, conveys a stroi^ 
impression of the opulence 
Â«.â€ž-Â»â€” of England. The principal 



184 ENGLAND AND WALEa 

trees ar^ the oak, elm, beech, ash, chestnut, sycamore, poplar, and willow. The vine was 
at one time extensively cultivated in sonthem England, but is now seen only in a few. 
detached places. 

The leading grain in England is wheat ; barley, oats and rye, being in a great measure 
local to the less favored dbtricts. The turnip and potato are almost everywhere culti- 
vated ; and peas, beans, and clover are extensively diffused. Hops are produced in the 
counties of Surrey, Worcester, and Hereford. Hemp,ilax, and some other useful produc- 
tions of the soil, are less conspicuous. The principal fruit-trees are the apple, pear, cher- 
ry, and plum ; but none of the fruits reach the perfection of those of the United States. 
The English garden produces a great variety of pot-herbs, most of which have been in- 
troduced from the continent within the last three centuries. 

Animals, â€” Of the useful animals, England possesses a considerable variety, ^f 
draught-horses are remarkable for their bulk, generally fine condition, and great strength. 
The race and riding-horse have been improved by the best blood of Arabia and BarbaiY. , 
There are excellent breeds of both sheep and catde; and the pig is also an animal m 
prime condition, and extensively reared. Some of the ancient wild animals, as the wol( 
boar, and beaver, are now extinct; and others, as thie stag and wild-ox, are very rare. 
The hare, partridge, and pheasant, are the chief game-animals, grouse being onlyi^cmdy 
and that in small amount, in some of the northern wolds. Most of the smaller qnaAn- 
peds, birds, insects, etc., common in the same latitude, are found in England. The ni|^tÂ». 
mgale is said to be not heard farther north than Yorkshire. The rivers present trout, peicbi 
etc., and the adjacent seas abound in herring, mackerel, sole, pilchard, and other edible 
fishes. 

Agricultwre, â€” Agriculture is, in England, in a progressive state, but is yet not nearly 
so far advanced as in the better parts of Scotland. 

The chief defects of the agricultural system of England are in the modes of tillage. 
Cumbrous- machinery is employed to do what might be better done by a lighter and 
cheaper kind ; thus five horses, and even more, are sometimes seen at one plough, while 
the heaviest lands in Scotland require only two. The virtue of draining is scarcely dreamt 
of in many districts of England, while in Scotland it is, in some places, doubling the 
produce, besides improving the salubrity of the climate. English tarmers are too little 
educated to be ready to adopt improved modes of agriculture ; and, amongst the class 
of landlords, these have hitherto been too much overlooked. But thfe state of things is 
not likely to last much longer. 

Mr. ArCulloch calculates that twelve millions of acres are cultivated in England, as 
follows : â€” 

ACltBS. 

Wheat â€¢ a.800,000 

Barley and Rye 900,000 

Oats and Beans 3,000,000 

Clover 1,800,000 

Roots (turnips, potatoes, etc.) 1,800,000 

Hops and garden products. 150,000 

Fallow â€¢ 1,650,000 

â€¢ 

12,000,000 

The value of the crops is estimated by the same writer at $360,000,000. He also cal- 
culates 17,000,000 acres of pasture-land, as producing $300,000,000. 

Antiquities. â€” Perhaps the earliest objects of antiquity in England are the Barrows or 
Tumuli, with which the Britons, like so many other uncivilized nations, were accustomed 
to cover the remains of the dead. Several specimens of these still exist. 

Druidical Remains rank, perhaps, next in point of antiquity. The cromlech consists of 
a large slab of stone, placed flat-wise, or in a sloping position, upon two upright ones. 
It seems to have formed an altar for human sacrifices. Druidical Circles are more com* 
plicated. They usually consist of circles of huge stones, placed on end, with, in some in- 
stances, connected lines or rows of similar stones, the whole forming objects at once rade 
and imposing. It is believed that they were the temples of the I>ruids. The most le- 



ENGLAND AND WALEa 125 

mark-able Druidieal Circle ia that of Abury, six .miles from Marlborough, in Wiltshire : 
there is an outer circle 1,400 feet in diametÂ«r, composed of stones generally about 16 feet 
in height, with a distance of 27 feet between every two. 

Another Druidieal Circle of great note is that of Stonehet^e, upon Salisbury Plain, a 



Sionehenge. 

district also presenting many tumuli and other vestiges of the Britons. The Stonehenge 
temple, in its perfection, consisted of 140 atones, arranged in two concentric circles, the 
outermost 108 feet in diameter, with simitar stones laid flat^-wiae along the tops of the 
upright stones. The bloclis which remain are from eighteen to twenty feet high, and 
about seven feet broad. Within the inner circle are two oval ranges, supposed to have 
formed the admytum or ceil, and which consists of stones about thirty feet in height 
The remains of this stupendous temple, ruined and shattered as they are, still produce a 
sensation of awe upon the mind of the beholder, 

BoMAK Kemains are now rare and nearly obliterated. The roads formed by this people 
have, in some instances, been changed into the present comparatively broad ana well- 
formed ways ; in other cases, slight tmces of their original pavement, wKich generally 
consisted of large stones forming a causeway, are to.be found. Between Newqpstle and 
Carlisle are the remains of the two walls built respectively by the emperors Adrian and 
Severus, in 120 and 210, to keep out the northern barbarians; the first being a high 
mound of earth, and the second a rampart of stone, 68^ miles long, running parallel to 
the first, on the outiide. Remains of Roman camps, bridges, villas, baths, etc., also exist 
in various parts of England. All the towns, the names of which terminate in Chester or 
coaler, are considered as having been originally Roman stations. 

Churches. â€” Several of the small Chpfches built after the introduction of Christianity 
still exist, and continue to be used as parish churches. The larger churches connected 
^^'ith monastic establishments, and the Cathedrals, which were the seats of bishops^ 
took their rise at a later period, chiefly during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. This 
was a time when an enthusiasm existed for founding and endowing monasteries and 
chorehes. Westminster Abbey, York Minster, and the cathedrals of Winchester, Lincoln, 
Gloucester, Canterbury, Litchfield and Salisbury, may be instanced as particularly au- 
gust specimens. There are also many ruins of the great abbeys of the middle ages :

after the oonqnest, many sp^

most Boperb example of tki 
class of sbiictures. Convii 
and Caernarvon CastJea, 'Â«iicb

The Tower of Londoa. Lancaster, Carlisle, NevcsuJe, 

and Rugby Castlea. Ther 
nsnally consist of a great square tower, with ranges of lesser towers, and the whole sm- 
tonnded by thick and lofty walls, beneath which there was generally a rooat or wet ditch. 
Mansions. â€” A certain class of English mansions may be described as engrafted (^lon 
the fortzesses of the Middle Ages, or upon the priories and abbeys disused at the Be- 
formation. Wanoick Castle, the seat of the Earl of Warwick, situated upon a rock fonj 
feet above the river Avon, and Alnwick GasUe, in Nortbumberlaod, the seat of the Dub 
of Northumberland, are splendid examples of the first class of edifices. Tbe area of tk 
latter building Is divided into three courts, entered through gateways formed is lottr 
towers. The keep, or citadel, is of vast magnitude, and acquires some peculiar points 
of architectural beauty from ' fair semi-cimalar towers,' which protect and adorn it on 
every side. Newstead Abbep, in Nottinghamshire, the seat of the late Iiord Byron taa 
of his ancestors, may be instanced as a beautiful and impressive example of the dome^ 
tic mansion founded upon tbe remains of a monastic building. 

There is a class of old mansions which appear to be peculiar to England, and ue 
nsoally called Sails. They date in many instances from the sixteenth century, the day; 
of tbe first Tndors. SadJon Hall, near Derby, belonging to the Duke of Knuand, is an 
unusually handsome specimen of the class. They generally present a front, of inegokr 
form, advancing into prominent bows with many windows,aRd constructed of brick upon 
a fantastically shaped framework of timber, the exterior of which is left exposed and 
painted. A variety of angular projections break (he line of the roof, and give occasion 
to much car^d wood-work. In the interior there is always a goodly hall of oak, with a. 
diced floor, a huge set of oaken tables, and a spacious fireplace. 

AnotBer large class of English mansions are of a style which prevailed in the seven- 
teenth century, and which comprehends many substantial as well as decorative features 
Elegant fronts of polished stone, with traces of turreting, ornamented square windows, 
and tall angular chimney-stalks, strike an untechnical spectator as the principal feature* 
of this style, usually called Elizabethan. Holland House, Kensington, and Jheobaids, 
the seat of the celebrated Secretary Cecil, present apt examples. 

The houses built in the last century were chiefly in the Grecian style, more or leee 
pure. For instance, Kiddlestone House, the residence of Lord Scarsdale, near Derby, 
the front of which is a line of 360 feet, comprehending a central and two lateral masses 
connected by low corridors, and universally admired for its classic purity and grsre. 
OlatswoTth, the seat of the Duke of Devonsoire, also neat Derby, is another magrufinnt 
mansion of this class. 

Within the last fifty years, houses have been built in various styles, imitative of mode* 
long ago fashionable. It is common now-a-days to baild bonses, from the foOtadalioD, ic

IdUon HdUy the seat of the Marquis of Westimnsteri sitnated near Chester, may be 
o6naidered as a porima example of the modem Gk>thic. It comprises, besides other apart^ 
ments, an entrance hall, paved with variegated marbles, a music gallery, adorned with 
two fine pictures by West, a saloon, decorated with some beautiful specimens of stained 
glass, and a library. This magnificent mansion is much visited by strangers on acoouAt 
of its arehitectoial beauty, its splendid furniture, and the vast number of interesting 
objects contained in it It cost the enormous sum of X1,000,000 sterling. 

AhabiianUy Lamguage^ etc. â€” At the period of the Roman invasion,'EngIand was posÂ» 
sessed by various aboriginal tribes, supposed by some to have been Celts, and by others 
a mixture of the Celtic and Gk>thic races. Their descendants still form the chief bulk 
of the people of Wales and Cornwall, but their langustge is extinct, except among the 
Welch. The south-east at that period was occupied by the BelgsB, a branch of the Teu> 
tonic familv, from Gaul, which had dispossessed the natives and driven them into the 
itttrarior. After the downfall of the Roman power, the south-east and midland districts 
were subdued by the Jutes and Saxons ; ana Norfolk and Suffolk by the Angles, while 
the north was overrun, sometimes possessed, and largely colonized by the Danes â€” all 
kindred families of the Gothic on Teutonic race. The Normans subdued England in 
^le eleventh century, and subsequently commingling with the Jutes, Danes and Angles, 
form the present intermixture, the modem En^ish and the English language. For a 
long period, however, the people of each county had a dialect peculiar to themselves ; 
but by the diffusion of education, intercommunion and other causes, the mother tongÂ«e 
has become more uniCctfm, and one language, substantially the London dialect, is now, 
with sliffht deflections only, spoken in every part ; and, difiiised by Colomsts from 
Engiano, has become naturalized in various parts of Asia, Africa, and Australia. In 
fact, the EngUsh bids Â£a4r to become the prevailing language of the globe. The ground* 
work of the English language is Saxon, with a large addition from the Greek, Latin 
and French. 

PopuUUiaiL â€” The amount of the population of England and Wales prior to the year 
1801 cannot be ascertained with any aegree of certainty. McCuIloch conjectures tiiat 
at the era of the conquest it amounted to about 2,150,000 : Mr. Chalmers estimates its 
amount in 1377 at 2,350,000, and the celebrated political arithmetician, Grego^ I^inR^ 
in 1696, states it at 5,300,000. Since 1801 a decennial census has been taken. The fol* 
lowing table exhibits the gradual progress of the population from 1801 to 1851 : â€”

1841 15,178,164 911,241 16,084,405 

1851 17,922,768 

About one third the people reside in'towns having a population of 10,000 and upwards ; 
and as the increase of this class is mpidly progressing, and in a greater ratio than the 
population of the rural districts, it indicates a corresponding preponderance in manufac- 
turing industry. 

Ciiie9, â€” London, the British metropolis, is a world within itself. It is situated in 
the counties of Middlesex, Kent, and Surrey, on the banks of the Thames, sixty miles 
fifom the sea. The larger portion of the city is built on the north side of the river, and 
rises in a gentie slope from the water's edge. Its outline is exceedingly irregular, and it 
is difficult to determine its exact extent. It is usually said to include all the buildini 
in a radius of four miles around St. Paul's CathedraL The area cannot be less than 
to 25 square miles. It must be borne in mind, however, that London is not one city 
only, but consists of eight distinct municipalities, including two cities, and six boroughs, 
with extensive suburban villages and hamlets. The cities are London proper sind West^ 
minsteff and the boroughs Marylebone^ Finsbury^ Tower Hamlets^ Southtoark^ Lambeth 



128 ENGLAND AND WALES. 

and Greenwich; with which are indnded to make np the borough, Dept/ord and Woei- 
wich; the five first being in Middlesex, the two next in Surrey, on the sonth side of the 
Thames, and the last, also on the south side of the Thames, in Kent The streets ik 
for the most part wide, but there are also many which scarcely admit of the passage of 
carriages. The finest streets are those in Westminster and Marylebone, where the m- 
tocracy reside. This portion of the city is known as the ** West End," and contaiiB 
the Royal Palaces, the seats of the executive and legblative govemmente, theparks, and 
in general the most splendid buildings. The city proper is known as the " Kast End' 
which comprehends also the most populous portions of Tower Hamlets, The foreign 
merchants are chiefly quartered in this portion of the city, and considerable mannfactines 
are carried on, especially in silk-weaving and sugar-refining. It also contains the exten- 
sive docks and warehouses at Blackwall, belonging to the East India Company ; those 
connected with the West India trade at Poplar ; the London Docks, at Wapping^ and 
St. Catharine's Docks, near the Tower. SotUhwark and Lambeth contain some extensite 
iron foundries, breweries, and many other important manufacturing establishments^ 
especiallv those of patent shot and plate-glass. The latest additions to this great me- 
tropolis, have been made on the north and north-west, in jS^ Paitcras, Fmsbury^ etc. The 
bouses built here are of brick, chiefly supplied on the spot, and are generally faced vMi 
stucco. Few are of more than three stories, and whole streets are built of uniCmii 
design. 

Of public buildings, the Cathedral Church of St. PatU^ in the city, is in the Bomaa 
style of architecture, built in the form of a cross, with a large dome in the centre. It iÂ» 
500 feet in length, 180 in breadth, and the height to the top of the cross which snrmpimts 
the dome, is 350 feet. The whole building is of Portland stone, now very much <fiÂ»" 
colored with smoke, and long exposure to the weather. The interior is very plain ; but 
of late years the dull monotony of its appearance has been to a considerable extent re- 
lieved by a number of monuments, erected to the memory of England's worthies. 

The Uhurch of St. Peter y commonly called " Westminster Abbey," though not so 

1>rominent an object as St. Paul's, is of not less distinguished *fame. It is likewise in th* 
brm of a cross, but without a dome or central tower ; and the tameness of its exterior 
aspect is but little relieved by two modern towers at its west end. The whole buildiDg 
is in the Norman and Gothic styles, and some parts of it are of great antiquity, llic 
dimensions of the abbey from east to west, including Henry Seventh's Chapel, are 375 
feet; from north to south 200 feet; height of the nave 101 feet; from the choir to the 
lantern 141 feet : of the western towers 225 feet The interior is crowded with monih 
ments of the illustrious dead ; and it is here that the ceremony of the coronation of the 
kings and queens of England is performed. The other churches of the metropolis aie 
generally small in proportions, and few can boast of a high order of architecture. One 
hundred new churches have been erected within a few years by the Church Elxtensioa 
Society. 

Adjoining the Abbey is Weitminster Hallf the only remaining part of the palace 
commenced by King William Rufus. It measures 276 feet in length by 100 in breadth, 
is covered with an elegant roof formed of oak, and now forms the entrance hall of the 
magnificeht building erected for the accommodation of the Imperial Parliament, a build- 
ing second to none in Europe. This new Parliament House cx>vers an area of near 
eight acres. It has four fronts (that on the river being 400 feet long), and three 
principal towers from 300 to 340 feet high. The southern portion of the baUding b 
appropriated to the House of Peers, and the library, committee -rooms, refreshment 
rooms, and other offices belonging to it The Queen's entrance, used on the occa- 
sions when her Majesty goes in person to open and prorogue Parliament, is under the \^ 
toria Tower ; whence, ascending a few steps to the first or principal floor, she passes 
through the Robing-room and the Victoria-gallery to the throne end of the House of 
Peers. 

In like manner, the northern portion of the building is devoted to the House of Com- 
mons, with its various committee-rooms and offices ; the residences of the Speaker, the 
Serjeant-at-Arms, etc., being at the extreme end near the Clock Tower. In the midst, 
between the two Houses, and communicating with both, is a grand central bail, which 



ENGLAND AND WALES. 129 

# 

is approached ftom the western firont by another passage, called St Stephen's Hall. The 
Hoose of Lords is 90 feet long by 45 wide and 45 high. The House of Commons is 63 
feet long, and 45 feet in wid& and height St Stephen's Hall is 95 feet long, 30 feet 
wide, and 50 feet high. The House of Lords is furnished and decorated in a most gor- 
geous style ; richly gilt mouldings, emblazonings of arms, paintings, stained glass win- 
aowB, and velvet-pile carpeting conlaributing to complete one of the most imposing 
pictures ever witnessed of the kind. The House of Commons will be more plainly 
furnished, but still will not be deficient in any of the essentials of comfort and fi[randeur. 
St Stephen's Hall, besides being decorated with stained glass windo^vs and o^er orna- 
mental features, will be further enriched with a variety of sculptures, busts of eminent 
statesmen, etc. The general style of the whole building is a richly decorated Gothic. 
There is a Strangers' Qallery in either House, to which persons having orders from a 
member are admitted to hear the debates. During the hours the,House of Peers sits 
judicially, being the highest Court of appeal in the realm, the public have free access, as 
to other Courts. At other times permission to view the House, when not sitting, may 
be obtained bv application at the Lord Chamberlain's office. The Lords assemble for 
legislative business at five o'clock; the Commons generally at four, sometimes at twelve. 

In the same neighborhood is Whitehall^ a small portion of a palace commenced by 
King James I, now occupied as a military chapel ; the royal palace of Pimlico or Buck" 
ingham Hause, an old building new faced and remodelled ; and St. James^Sj an ancient, 
irr^ular, and gloomy structure of brick ; also, on the right of Westminster Hall, are the 
principal Churts of Law^ with entrances to them seversdly. These buildings, the chief 
front of which is facing St Margaret's Church, are comparatively modem, having been 
remodelled in 1820-24. 

The prindpcd ofiioes in which the financial and other executive business of the country 
is conducted, are situated in Whitehall and Downing Street, which runs out of it, skirt- 
ing the south-east comer of St James's Park, being within the immediate precincts of the 
former Royal residence. 

3%a Treasurp building, {he head controlling department of the executive, at the corner 
of Downing Street and Whitehall, has a new front of handsome Italian architecture. 
The offices of the Privy Council, of which the Board of Trade is a special department 
are located in distinct portions of this building. 

Adjacent to the latter, and nearer Charing- Cross, is the office of the Secretary of State 
for the Home Department. The Foreign and Colonial Offices^ respectively presided over 
by principal Secretaries of State, are in Downing Street 

i%e Horse Chuirds^ in which all that relates to the organization and disposition of the 
army is conducted under the General commanding in chief, is situated immediately fac- 
ing the Banqueting-House, Whitehall, its rear looking out upon St James's Park. 
Though a striking feature in its way, with a cupola-topped dock-tower, the style of its 
architecture b neither classical nor elegant 

The Ordnance Department of the army is conducted at the Ordnance Office> Pall-Mail, 
neariy opposite St James's Square. 

The Admiralty is situated close to the Horse Quards. It is a stately building, flanked 
by wings, and having a handsome architectural screen in front of the court-yard. The 
naval department of the Govemment is conducted by five Lords of the Admiralty, the 
first or chief of whom is cdways a member of the Cabmet, but generally not a naval man. 

The Board of Control^ for superintending the politiccd affairs of the JSast Indian Gov- 
ernment, and having a discretionary authority correlative with, and in some cases beyond 
that of the East bidia Company, is also located in this part of the town, though in a 
secluded^ spot, namely, in Cannon Street, Westminster, between Parliament Street and 
the river. It is a neat building of brick and stone. The Chairman of the Board of Control 
is always a member of the Cabinet 

Somerset House is situated in the Strand, extending to the river on the eastern side 
of Waterloo Bridge, and has an area of 500 feet by 800 feet The Strand-front has a

airoB of England. Passing through the gateway, we come to a handsome qnadran^ 
around which are the entrances to the several offices to which the building is apprc^ 
ated. The river-front, one of the finest fofodes in Europe, is flanked by a handsomew 
race. The principal Government Offices in the building are those connected with th 
collection of certain branches of Inland revenue, as the Stamps and Taxes, the Eidx 
including the Legacy duty, the Audit Office, etc. ; and with the internal government d 
the country as the Poor-law Commission, the Tithe Commission, the Registrar-Gkoenl 
etc. In the Strand portion are apartments appropriated to the Royal Society, the Ami 
quarian Society, the London University, and the CSovernment School of Design. Thi 
east wing, which was added a few years ago, belongs to King's CoDege, the ground hst 
ing been granted for the purpose. There is a separate entrance to the College, tbrongl 
a gateway facing the church of St. Mary-le- Strand. In the same quarter of the city an 
the National Gallery and the British Jl^eum, including, besides a vast collection of coii 
osities, a library of 500,000 volumes, the laj^st in the lungdom, and one of the laigest ii 
the world ; also University College, Drary Lane and Covent Garden Theatres, and th 
Inns-of-Court establishments, in which those persona intended for the profession of tb 
law are required to eat a certain number of dinners, daring terms of three or five veais 
the expense of which, together with a species of fine, amounts to about Â£130. HaTini 
undergone this probationary requisite, the students are considered qualified for admi^ioi 
to the bar,.if members of the society will move that they be " called." The ceremony of â–  
"call" is invariably followed by a festive banquet, at which the newly-made "learned 
gentleman entertains his friends. 

The Inns-of-Court having power to call to the Bar, are Lincoln's Inn, the Inner Ten 
^ pie, the Middle Temple, and (Sray's Inn. LincoliCs Inn is situated between Cbancw; 
Lane and Lincoln's-Inn Square, and derives its name ixom the Earl of Lincoln, w(Â» 
erected a mansion on this spot in the reign of Edward L The buildings form a qoaii 
rangle, one side of which is occupied by the chapel and the old hall. The Temple i 
thus called, because it was anciently the dwelling bouse of the knights-templai;

At the suppression of that order it was purchased by the professors of the Ck>mmon 
law, and converted into inns. They are called the Inner and Middle Temple, in re- 
lation to Essex House, which was also a part of the house formerly belonging to the 
knights, and called the Outer Temple, because it was situated outside Temple Bar, 
The principal entrance to the Temple is the Middle- Temple Gate, which was erected 
from the design of Inigo Jones. It is adorned with the figure of a lamb, the badge of the 
society. 

The Inner Temple is situated to the east of Middle-Temple Gkite, and has a cloister, a 
large garden, and spacious walks. The gardens, which extend along the banks of the 
Thames, form a delightful promenade, commanding fine views of Waterloo and Black- 
friars Bridges and of Somerset House. They are open to the public at six o'clock in 
the evening, for a few of the summer months, commencing the nrst week in June. The 
Middle Temple^ which joins the Inner Temple on the west, is so called from having been 
the central portion of the ancient Temple, Ghray^s Inn, situated in Holborn, is so called 
from having been the residence of the ancient family of CSray of Wilton, who in the 
reign of Edward III. bequeathed it to several students of the law. The handsome 
garden is open to respectably dressed people every day. Besides these principal inns of 
court, there are two Serjeants' Inns, the one in Fleet Street, the other in Chancery 
Lane. 

The Custom House has a noble river front, including three porticos of the Ionic order, 
with a terrace walk before it It is situated a little above the Tower and immediately ad- 
joining Billingsgate Market, famed for the finest fish and the richest "slang" in the world, 
and covers an area of 488 feet in length by 100 in depth. The present building was com- 
pleted in 1817, from the designs of Mr. Laing. The Long Room, where merchants and 
ship masters from all parts of the world resort daily, to pass their accounts, measures 196 
feet by 66 feet, and 50 feet high. 

East-India House. â€” The house in which the East India Company conduct the Home 
Government of the important Asiatic possessions, is situated in Leadenhall Street, about 
a quarter of a mile beyond the Royal Exchange. It is a spacious and handsome edifice, 
with a projecting portico of the Ionic order. Above the pediment are representations 
of Britannia, and emblems of the Thames and the Granges. 

The metropolis is supplied with water through pipes, by nine private companies, 
whereof six are on the Middlesex and three on the Surrey side of the river. The earliest 
in date of foundation is the New River Company, founded by Sir Hugh Middleton, at 
the beginning of the reign of James L The quantity of water daily poured into the town 
by these companies is upwards of 44 millions of gallons. 

There are eight cemeteries established and conducted by companies of proprietors, on 
the outskirts of the town, of which that at Kensal Ghreen is the most important, and was 
the first established. The others are at Brompton, Highgate, Abney Park near Stoke 
Newington ; the Victoria at Mile End and at the Tower Hamlets, on the north side 
of the river ; and the Norwood Cemetery, and Nunhead Cemetery, on the Surrey 
side. 

The principal markets are : for cattle, Smithfield ; for butcher's meat (carcase), Leaden- 
hall Market and Newgate Market ; for vegetables, Covent GJarden and Hungerford ; for 
fish. Billingsgate and Hungerford ; for general provisions, meat, poultry, vegetables, etc, 
Farringdon Market, Finsbury Market, Newport Market, the Borough Market, Leaden- 
hall Market, and Hungerford Market 

The Clubs of London are a distinguishing feature in the social condition of this great 
Metropolis, which is without parallel in any other quarter of the globfe. They owe their 
origin to the gregarious propensities of men in large communities, restrained by a 
certain principle of exclusiveness. Their philosophy is based upon the known power of 
an aggregation of comparatively small contributions. For six or eight guineas a year, a 
man, having his time upon his hands, may live during half his life (twelve out of t^e 
twenty-four houfs) in a splendid mansion, furnished with a' library, newspapers, and 
writing materials, etc, in abundance, and an unexceptionable cuisine, at fixed and mode* 
rate charges ; associating upon equal terms with others much his superiors in rank, posi*

tioii) and worldly advantages. We are fain to repeat that this is a consummation re- 
snlting from a high degree of practical civilization, which, in the present state of society 
and politics, conld not be successfully accomplished in any other capital in the worid. 
The Clubs are undoubtedly an ofishoot of the taverns and coffee-houses of former days, 
which were long the accustomed resort of men of wit and fashion about town : witnen 
Will's Coffee-house, in Covent-garden ; the Grecian, near the Temple ; the St James's 
Coffee-house ; the Turk's Head, Gerrard street, Soho â€” names immortalised by assodatioii 
with those of Johnson, Grarrick, Reynolds, Burke, Groldsmith, and a host of other bemtx 
esprUsy who frequented them. In process of time, as men separated into cliques and 
classes, a desire for selection and control, combined, perhaps, with a spirit of economr, 
led to the establishment of Clubs upon a sort of joint-stock principle, where all the ad- 
vantages of a tavern might be combined with the splendor of a private mansion, at a 
rate of charge avoiding mtermediate profit to a proprietor, and above all, with a veio 
upon the admission of guests. In most of the early Clubs, gambling was carried on to 
a great extent; but in xhose of recent formation, regulations are laid down excluding 
games of chance, and restricting the stakes upon omers. Many of the Clubs created 
within the present generation are appropriatea to particular classes, as the '^United Ser- 
vice," the " Army and Navy," the " University," and the " Oxford and Cambridge,^ 
where certain qualifications are necessary for admissibility; others assume by Iheir 
names, more than in reality, a peculiar character as to politics or pursuits, as the ^ B^ 
form," the " Conservative," the " Travellers," the " AthensBum," the " Parthenon," the 
^G^arrick;" but the grand element in the constitution and objects of all is the same, 
that of association, of newspaper-reading, of agreeably passing away an idle hour, and, 
above all of eating a good oinner and drinking fair wine at a moderate price. Some of 
the younger Clubs, as the " Parthenon," the " Erectheum," the " Ghurrick," the " Reform," 
more liberal than their elder brethren^ permit a member to introduce a friend, sometimes^ 
two, to the advantages of the social board â€” a privilege which country cousins doubtksb 
will not allow their Club friends to treat as a dead letter, the more especially as it is an 
imperative rule, in all cases, that the whole cost of the entertainment must be paid by 
the member who invites, and not by the guest. 

The ordinary charge for dinner off the joint is two shillings, with an extra of sixpenoe 
or ninepence for <' the table." Cold meat, with table beer and bread d discretion^ maf 
be had till four o'clock for sixpence â€” a cheap lunch, convertible, by a slight effort d 
imagination, into an earW dinner. No gratuities are allowed to waiters. 

The territory of the Clubs lies between Charing-cross and St James's street, Pa8-^ 
Mall being the principal scene of recent colonization. A spot more convenient for easy^ 
access at once to the world of business on the one hand and of fashion and pleasure 
on the other, could not be selected. There are some stragglers in other parts, both eart 
and west, which wUl appear by the list which follows. 

The newer Clubs have all been outvieing one another in the size and stateliness of 
their buildings, incurring, in many instances, a heavy amount of sunk capital upon tho 
respective concerns. The old quiet houses of PaU-Mall are rapidly disappearing, t<> 
make room for these communist palaces. The Athenaeum and United Service Qubs, 
which stand at the two comers facing Waterloo-place, were looked upon as architectural 
marvels not to be surpassed. Shortly afterwards, however, came the Reform, the Con- 
servative, the Oxfora and Cambridge, and, lastly, the Army and Navy, which have 
thrown their earlier competitors into the shade. 

The following is a list of the Clubs in London: â€” 

Whitens, 37 and 38, St. James's street, had its origin and name from a coffee-house of 
which White was the Proprietor, standing near the bottom of St. James's street, and 
established about 150 years ago. It was formed into a Club somewhere between 1730 
and 1740, the subscription, however, being paid to the proprietor. The present honsej 
was built by James Wyatt

The bridges which span the Thames are among the most magnificent in the wrakl, 
and celebrated for then- substantial strength. London Bridge, rebuilt and opened in 
1831; Southwark Bridge, completed in 1819, and Blackfriar's Bridge, open since 1769, 
afford the means of communication between the city and borough of Sonthwait 
Higher up the river, Waterloo Bridge, opened in 1817, Hungerford Suspension Bridge fw 
foot passengers only, Westminster Bridge, built in 1750, and Vauxhall Bridge, in ISIG, 
connect the districts of Westminster and Lambeth. London, Waterloo, Blackfrian, 
and Westminster bridges are built of stone; those of Hungerford, Southwark, snd 
Vauxhall, of iron ; but in these, the metallic arches and supporting spans rest on [ueii 
and abutments of masonry. These bridges vary in length from 1,242 (Waterioo)to 
708 (Southwark,) in breadth of roadway from 53 feet (London) to 36 feet (Vauxballj, 
and in the span of the principal arches from 240 feet (Southwaik), and 152 feet (Lon- 
don) to 76 feet (Blackfriar's). In addition to these communications, the Thames Tun- 
nel, a suli-aqueous passage beneath the bed of the Thames, was commenced at Rotbei- 
hithe in 1825, and after many interruptions from irruptions of the super-jaceDt watets, 
was completed in 1843, at a cost of X614,000. This is one of the most woodeifril 
structores in the world, and, as a commercial avenue between London and Soutbwail:, 
very advantageous. It consists of a mass of brick work 1200 feet long, 37 wide and 28 
hign, containing two arched passages within which are distinct roadways for carriage 
and pedestrians. 

The splendid parks of London are truly the lungs of the metropolis, and Important 
for health no less than as places of recreation and pleasure. These are &t. Jaraert 
Park, Green Park, Hyde Park, of 400 acres. Regent's Park, of 450 acres, in ttie West 
End, and Victoria Park, of about 290 acres, in tne eastern suburbs. Regent's Paifc is 
aurrounded by magnificent buildings, and contains besides a Botanic Garden, the Gv 
dens of the Zoological Society, whose collection of animals is one of the most interest- 
ing and attractive objects of public curiosity. Hyde Park is continuous with Kensin^ 
ton Gardens, a large enclosure connected with the royal palace. The Serpentine river, 
is a large oblong pond, partly in Kensington Gardens and partly in Hyde Park. These 
parka are highly adorned with ornamental woods, and contain several statues of British

No dlj ia the 'woild, leavine out the popalooa cities of China, exceed this amonnt ; and 
even Rome in faer palmiest days cannot be said to have surpassed the British metropolis . 
in this respect. The supply of provisionB is in general abundant, and the prices reason- 
ably cheap. Their cost in New York and London is about equal ; but on account of the 
cheapness of house-rent and fuel, living in London is more economicaL

In reference to the extent and activity of its commerce, London stands without a 
rivaL Its foreign trade, it may safely be affirmed, exceeds not only that of every other 
city of the woud, bat even the entire fcveign trade of all countries, except France and 
the United States. 

The Thames itself forms the Port of Lon1>on ; and for several rhiles below the city 
the river is constantly crowded with vessels from every part of the world, the masts of 
w^bich present the appearance of an interminable forest The limits of the port, bow- 
ev^, are Loudon bridge and Deptford. The celebrated docks connected with the port 
and trade of London, are built on an extensive scale. The tobacco warehouse belong- 
ii^ to the London Docks covers an area of five acres, and the underground vaults, which 
are 18^ acres in extent, afford stowage for 60,000 pipes of wine. 

A knowledge of the inland and coasting trade of London can only be arrived at by 
approximate ^culations. The probable value of merchandize transferred yearly by way 
of trade, may be estimated at X300,000,000 sterling. 

The internal trade of London has been greatly facilitated by a series of Railroads 
'which emanate &om it, extending to all parts of the island. Handsome and extensive 
stations have been erected for these railroads, for the Great Western, at Paddington, for 
the North Western at Euston Square, for the Great Northern at King's Cross, for the 
Â£!a8tern Counties, which branches into two lines, that of Cambridge and that of Col- 
chester, on the Shoreditch road, â€” all these on the north side of the river ; and on the 
sooth side for the South Western Railroad near Waterloo Bridge, and for the South 
Sastera near London Bridge. The Blackwall and Greenwich Railroads also have dis- 
tinct stations, the first on Penchurch street, the other at Bricklayers Arms.

Liverpool, next to London, the greatest prat in the empire, is situated in LancashiR. 
on the east bank of the estnaiy of tbe Mersey, at the distance of 36 miles from Maji- 
Chester, and 204 from London. The town extends for about three miles along the 
Mersey, and rather more than one mile inland, tbe situation enjoying a slight slope to- 
wards the river. On the side next the connlzy, the town extends into atuneroca saber- 
ban districts, comprehending many villas, the residences of the more wealthy citizcos. 
Liverpool, in 1851, contained 286,487 inhabitants ; but, inclnsive of the immedtste 
environs, and the persons engaged in navigation, the whole number is beliered to be not 
less than 300,000. Its rise has been surprisingly rapid, equal to that of an Amerku 
town. In the reign of Elizabeth, it was only a small village ; in 1700 thcxe -wbcc about 
6,000 inhabitants ; in 1760, 26,000 ; and in 1801, 77,653. 

Idverpoot is the grand medium through which the trade of England with Ireland and 
America is carried on ; and a vast quantity of buainess is transacted by its merchants 
with the ports of tbe Mediterranean, East Indies and other parts of the worid. Tbe 
leading aMicle of import is tbe cotton so extensiv^y used in the maaofactoiies of Lan- 
cashire. The rural produce of Ireland, cattJe, bacon, poultry, eggs, etc, fcwms tbe im- 
port next in amount The duties paid at ths custpm-hoose of Liverpool, average about 
a fifth of those paid throughout the whole kingdom. About 10,000 vessds, of all kindi, 
averaging about 200 tons eEu:h, visit the port annually. Liverpool is the great oatlet for 
the goods manufactured in Lancashire and Yorkshire for sale in Amraica. In connec- 
tion with tbe commerce carried on with the United States, there is a large transit of 
passengers. This is carried on by means of a periodical series of well-appointed and 
qoit^-sailing vessels, osually termed "liners;" but for several years past, it has been con- 
ducted also by means of steam -vessels. There are also steam-vessela conveying passengss, 
daily, to and from Dublin, Glasgow, and several Welsh ports, and only a litUe less freqnoit- 
ly to other Irish harbors, and to several porta in the sonth-westem division of England. 

The docks, a magnihcent series of deep-water harbors, extend along the whole front 
of tbe town. They are 12 or 13 in number, with an aggregate snp^&cies of 30 aoes, 
and eight miles of quays.

Norwich, in SufTolli, 129 miles north-east from Itondon, is the most ancient of the

ScoTLANn, the nortiiern diviidon of Great Britain, and formerly in itaelf_a kingdom, 
is separated from England by tbe Cheviot Hills and a eerie eatest 

length of the mainland is IKJO miles, from the Mull of Gallowi ; tbe 

breadth is very variable, the greatest being 146 miles, from Bt stern- 

most point of Roas^hire ; but the country is so indented wit! nlets, 

that there is actually no place in Scotland more than 40 milet if the

Mountaim. â€” The mountaina of the northern highlands extend on the west soatbwaicb 
ftom cape Wrath to the Caledonian Canal, which separates them from the chain of the 
Cirampians. They cover the whole of the western portion of the counties of Sutherlaod, 
Boss, and Inverness, and send out branches to the east, partioalarly in the two lattei 
connties, in which also are the loftiest summits. The country included between LodK 
broom and cape Wrath â€” probably one of the most savage, rocky, and barren tracts in 
Scotland â€” has no very high hills, although for a considerable distance inland it is in gene- 
ral elevated 1,000 feet above the sea. The highest culminations of this range are Ben At- 
tow, 4,000 feet; Ben Nevis, 4,373 feet; Ben Wyvis, 3,720 feet; BenDea^j^lfeet^etc

The Grampians, which divide the Highlands from the Lowlands of Scotland, com- 
mence at Loch Ettve in Argyleshire, and after passing, in a waving line, through Stir- 
ling, Perth, Abetdeen, and Kincardine, terminate between Stonehaven and the month of 
the Dee. The loftiest summits are in the east. Several ranges of no very great eleva- 
tion are detached from the northern face of the Grampians. The highest summits of these 
mountains are : Ben Lawers, 3,945 feet ; Ben Lui, 3,651 feet ; Ben Dearg, 3,690 feet; 
Caimtoul, 4,245 feet ; Ben Macdui, 4,390, etc.' Detached summits, mostly granitic^ are 
â– prinkled over the whole of Aberdeenshire. 

Occupying a portion of the extensive plain, intermediate between the Gram- 
pians and the northern continuation of the Cheviots, are two long and rievated 
ranges of trap-rocks, the one situated, in part, to the north of the Forth and Clyde, and 
the other to tne south of the former river. The northern range commences on the east, a 
little south of Montrose, and extends south-west as far as Dumbarton. It is known, in 
its several parts, by the local names of the Sidlaw Hills, the Ochill Hills, the Cajnpsie 
Hills, and Kilpatrick Hills. The greatest elevations in this range are: Ben Clack, 2,359 
feet, and a number of others, varying from 632 to 1,876 feet in elevation. 

The range of Cheviots, properly so called, are partly in Scotland and partly in Eng- 
land, and divide the countries. A branch proceeds northward, and there are a number of 
detached elevations belonging to this series of mountains. The greatest heights are : 
Broad Law, 2,741 feet ; Cheviot in Northumberland, 2,658 feet ; and others from 370 to 
2,500 feet above the level of the sea, 

These several ranges form the great features of the country, and are the watersheds 
from which proceed the rivers flowing in every direction. They are chiefly coveted with 
heatii, but in a number of cases they are clothed in grasses, which feed numerous herds 
of cattle and sheep, contributing largely to the wealth of the couotry.

Islands. â€” The chief groupa of the Scottish islands, are the following: â€” 

1. The Hebrides or Western Islands, between 200 and 3O0 in nnmber, with a total 
popnlafion of 90,000 inhabitants, who, for the moat part, are Roman Catholics. 

2. The Orkney Islands, separated from the northern extremity of Scottish main land 
by the Pentland Frith. They are 67 in nnmber, 29 of which are inhabited, with a total 
population of 40,000 inhabitants. 

3. The Shetlapo) Islands, still to the north-cast, are 87 in number, of which 40 am 
inhabited The total population is 30,000. 



The little horses of Shetland, 
known by the name of ponies, 
are of great use in mountainoiu 
districts. 

Rivers. â€” The moat important of 
the Scottish rivers are the Forth, 
Clyde, Tay, Tweed, and Spey. The 
Forth rises oo the east side of Ben 
Lomond, and runs in an easterly, 
winding du^ction, until it nnites 
with the Frith of the same name, 
at Alloa. The conntry on its banks 
is throughout low, flat, and rich, 
essels to Stirling, but is chiefly navi- 
hipa of 300 tons reach Alloa. The 
of the south highlands, not far from 
and the Annan, and flows in a soath- 
westem direction past Ulasgow, to the Forth. Near Lanark it is 
precipitated over falls of 186 feet within six miles. The Clyde has been rendered navigable 
up to Glasgow, having been made 13 feet deep to that port. The trade upon it is very 
extensive, and it is a crowded thoroughfare for boats and steamships. The Tay is the 
largest river in 'Scotland, rising on the western border of Perthahire, and forms in its course 
Loch Tay, whence it flows south-east to the Firth, which it joins below Perth. On the 
east side of Erickstane Hill the Tuseed takes its rise, and after flowing northward to Pee- 
bles, turns towards the east, and flows into the German Ocean at Berwick, forming for the 
last 16 miles of its coarse the boundaj^ between Scotland and England. The Spey issues 
from Loch-Spey, elevated 1,280 feet above the sea, and flows in a north-easterly direction 
into Momy Firth. Besides being one of the largest rivers in Scotland, it is also the most 
rapid. 

Lakes. â€” Lakes or Lochs of ireah water are very numerous in Scotland; many of them 
are of considerable size, and all celebrated for their picturesque beauty. They are chiefly 
among the mountains. The largest of these is Loch Lomond, between Dumbartonshire 
and Stirlingshire. It is 24 miles long and 7 J in its greatest width, and covers an area of 
28,000 acres, being the largest in Great Britain. The average depth is 20 fathoms, but 
in some places it is 80 and even 120 fathoms. Numerous small, beautifnl, and denselv- 
Tvooded islets stud its surface, and on its north-east bank Ben Lomond rises precipitously 
to the height or3,095 feet. This lake seems formerly to have been called Loch Leven(Smooti 
Lake), and the river which carries its surplus waters to the tide is still called by that name. 
Geology. â€” The geological structure of Scotland is very varied. In the Highlands the 
rocks are generally primary, the granite rising into lofty peaks, on which, in many in- 
stances, gneiaa, and other non-fossiliferous rocks abut or rest In the Lowlands the rocks 
are principally of the transition formation (graywacke, etc.), covered in many parts with 
coal-measures, trap, and red sandstone. Rocks superior to the red sandstone occur only 
in a few detached places, and in very small quantity. 

Granite is dug in the neighborhood of Aberdeen, and at Eiritcadbright, for building 
porposes. The city of Aberdeen itself is chiefly constructed of it ; and great quantities 
of it are transported to London, Liverpool, and other places, to be employed in building 
bridges, docks, and other stractnres, Â£n which unosaal dnrability is required. Slates of

excellent quality for ro6fing are quarried at Eaedale and Ballahulbh in Argyllshire, ani 
in other places. Sandstone slabs, for paving, are quarried in Caithness, ana at Arbroath 
in Forfarshire. A fine kind of sandstone is dug in many places, and is the primary cause 
of the architectural elegance of many of the public and private buildinp in the principal 
towns. Owing to the abundance of both sandstone and trap, both of which are excel- 
lently adapted for buildins;, little brick is used in Scotland. 

Jmnerals. â€” The coal-field of Scotland extends, with slight inteiruptions, across the 
central part, from the eastern extremity of Fife to Girvan in Ayrshire ; the principsi 
beds are near Dysart and Alloa ; in the vale of the Esk near Edinburgh ; near the line 
of the Forth and Clyde Canal ; at Paisley in Renfirewshire ; and at Dairy, Kilmarnock, 
and Girvan, in Ayrshire. The Scottish coal is chiefly of a hard and lumpy kind, calcu- 
lated to burn briskly, and therefore well adapted for manufacturing as weU as dome8& 
purposes. 

Lead is extensively wrought in the hills near the junction of Lanark and Dumfries 
shires, and silver was formerly obtained in considerable quantities in the same district 
Iron has lately been worked on a great scale in the northern district of Lanarkshire, and 
in the counties of Renfrew and Ayr. 

Sail â€” The soil of Scotland is of an exceedingly diversified character. On the com* 
paratively level tracts, much is composed of loam resting on the great day bed, or dilu- 
vium, or of alluvial clay washed down from the hills. Much level as well as hilly ground 
is also covered by peat bog. On the trap hills, a light and useful soil, composed of the 
material below, is generally found. A considerable quantity of the arable soil throughout, 
being composed of reclaimed bog, contains a peaty material. Out of the thirty thousand 
square nules comprehended in Scotland, about thirteen thousand are totally incapable of 
improvement ; nine thousand are wastes, believed to be capable of improvement ; and 
the remainder are pretty equally divided between arable and pasture land. 

In the last century, Scotland had become nearly bare of wood, the only patches being 
around gentlemen's seats. Within the last fifty or sixty years, this state of things has 
been greatly changed. Extensive plantations have been formed in most districts, as pro- 
tection to the cultivated lands. Scottish plantations consist chiefly of larch and fir ; but 
the country also produces oak, ash, and elm in jgreat abundance. It is calculated that 
about a million or acres in Scotland are now under wood. 

Climate. â€” The climate, as compared with that of England, is cold, dondy, and 
wet ; yet the temperature is not liable te such extremes as that of either England <^ 
France, seldom falling below 25 deg. Fahrenheit, or rising above 65 deg., the annual 
average being from 45 de^. te 47 des;. The summer is uncertain, and often comprehends 
many successive weeks of ungenial weather ; but, on the other hand, the winters are 
rarely severe, and often include many agreeable days and even weeks. The backward- 
ness of spring is perhaps the worst feature. 

Agrictdture. â€” Husbandry was in a very backward state in Scotland till the middle of 
the eighteenth century. The Highlands produced herds of the native small black catde; 
in the low countries, the higher grounds were occupied, as now, by flocks of sheep ; but 
there was little arable land, and that little was ill cultivated and comparatively unproduc- 
tive* Since then, Scotland may be said to have been one great experimental farm for 
the advancement of husbandry in aU its forms. The raising of turnips for the i^inter 
support of cattle, has been, in itself^ a most remarkable improvement. A proper rotation 
of crops has been studied, and has been attended with the best effects. Old, cumbrous, 
and expensive modes of tillage have been banished, and the light plough and cart sub- 
stitutea in their place. Draining has improved not only the soU but the climate. Lame, 
and latterly bone-manure and guano, have been extensively introduced. The productive- 
ness of the soil has, consequently, increased in an immense ratio. Oats, a hardy plant, 
calculated for most soils and climates, is still the chief grain raised in Scotland, and its 
meal is still the principal food of the peasantry, of working-people in general, and of tiie 
children of all classes of the community; it is said to cover 1,260,000 acres, or a fourth 
of the whole in cultivation. Barley, which forms a conspicuous article in the food of 
the common people, and is also used in distillation, occupies 280,000 acres. Wheat is 
believed to occupy only about 140,000 acres. Potatoes are extensively raised in Sco^ 
land, and constitute an important article of food to the working classes. The southon 



SCOTLAND. 141 

hills continue, as fonnerly, to be covered by extensive flocks, and sheep-farming has also 
been extensively introduced in the Highlands. 

Inkabitcmts. â€” The Scotch, except a part of the Highlanders, are, like the English, a 
Teutonic people, with only a few distinctive varieties of character, perhaps partly origi- 
nal, and partly the effect of local and political circumstances. It may be remarked, that 
though in the main Teutonic, the Scotch do not descend from the same branch of that 
race as the English. From language and other circumstances, it appears likely that the 
original colonizers of North Britain were from Scandinavia, Denmark, and Zealand. 

The Scotch (taking, as usual, the general characteristics of the people) may bÂ« de- 
scribed as a tall, large-boned, and muscular race. Even the women appear, to a southern 
eye, remarkable for the robustness of their figures. The Scotch figure is not so round and 
soft as the English. The face, in particular, is long and angular, with broad cheek bones. 
The cranium is also said to be somewhat larger, and tending more to a lengthy shape 
than that of the English. A fair complexion and light color of hair abound in Scotiand^ 
though there are also many instances of every other variety of tint. 

The Scottish character exhibits a considerable share of both energy and perseverance. 
It may safely be said, that a country with so many physical disadvantages could never 
have been brought into such a condition as respects rural husbandry, nor, with all the 
advantage of the English connection, been made so prosperous a seat of both manufac- 
tares and commerce, if the people had not been gifted in a high degree with those quali- 
ties. A disposition to a frugal and careftil use of means is also abundantly conspicuous 
in the Scotch. The poorest poor, at least in rural districts, are in few instances of such 
improvident habits as to exhibit that destitution of furniture, clothing, and tolerable house- 
accommodation, which meets the eye almost everywhere in Ireland. Caution, foresight^ 
and reflection may be said to enter largely into the Scottish character. Under the influ- 
ence of these qualities, they are slow and sometimes cold in speech, and are therefore apt 
to appear as deficient in frankness and generosity. These however are, in a great meas- 
tire, only appearances. That perfervidum inffeniumj or fiery genius, attributed to them by 
Buchanan, is still a deep-seated characteristic of the people. On subjects which they re- 
gard as important, they sometimes manifest this excitability in a very striking manner* 
There is a considerable tendency in the Scottish intellect to argumentative reasoning, 
and this shows itself in the service in their churches as weU as in their philosophical lite- 
rature. The domestic virtues flourish in much the same degree in Scotland as in EnÂ£^- 
land ; but the humbler classes in North Britain are not nearly so remarkable for cleanli- 
ness as the lower English, and they have suffered of late years from the extensive use of 
ardent spirits. The rural laboring classes are remarkable for their steady industry and 
decent conduct ; and it is only, perhaps, among the lower orders, in large towns, that 
much moral deterioration has taken place. For centuries, the wandering disposition of 
the Scoteb has been remarkable. An immense number of young persons, every year^ 
leave their native country to push their fortunes in the busier English cities, in public 
employment in India, in the colonies, or in other parts of the world. These persons have 
fi;enerally a tolerable education, ih proportion to their rank and prospects ; and being 
S>and possessed of steadiness, fidelity, and perseverance, they rarely fail to improve their 
circumstances. 

Population. â€” The population of Scotiand, at the end of the seventeenth century, did 
not probably exceed a million. In 1755, when an attempt was fiirst made to ascertain it, 
it appears to have been about 1,265,380. From that time, the country made a start in 
manufacturing and commercial prosperity, as well as*in improved modes of rural hus- 
bandry, and the population experienced a considerable increase, though not so great in 
proportion as the increase of wealth. The various censuses, since 1801, inclusive, give the 
following results : â€” Decennial IncbbaÂ«b.

The increase has takenplace entirely in large towns, a result of the progress of mtim- 
fiactures and commerce. The distribution of the population in the several counties hn- 
tremely diverse. Those containing the large manufacturing cities exhibit the greater 
density ; while in the agricultural counties, and in the northern Highlands, the ratio to 
the square mile is inferior. As a general fact, the farther we go north, the more spane 
the population becomes, and in Inverness and Sutherland numbers only from 14 to 17 
to the square mile. It may be said, indeed, that the Grampians form an impassable bar- 
rier betw^een civilization and the desert, for beyond them life seems bordering on extiiK> 
tion. 

VI. IRELAND. 

Situation and Extent. â€” Ireland has a rhomboidal form, having its longer side to the 
direction of the meridian, and its shorter from north-east to south-west. In the direction 
of its greatest diagonal, from Brow- Head to Fairhaven, it measures 306 miles; its ei- 
treme length from Brow-Head to Malin-Head is 290 miles, and its greatest length on a 
meridian, 235 miles. Its greatest breadth is 182 miles, but contracts in the centre, 
where from Gralway Bay to Dublin it is only 110 miles. The whole island has an area 
of 30,387 square miles, of which about two-thirds is capable of cultivation, the remain- 
der consisting of mountains, lakes, and bogs. 

Surface, â€” The surface, though generally level, frequently rises into low hills. On the 
east coast the mountains attain a considerable elevation ; but, with these exceptions, the 
hilly districts occur in the west None of these, however, reach 3,500 feet above the ssea. 
The level tracts are generally in the centre of the island, where an extensive plain, com- 
prising nearly a third of its whole superficies, extends from sea to sea, in no part attain- 
ing more than 325 feet elevation. The "bogs" of Ireland are its greatest disfigurement 
These are found principally in the higher parts of the central district^ and may neariy all 
be included between two lines drawn across the island â€” the one from Howth Head to 
Sligo, and the other from Wicklow to Gralway â€” the largest portion lying west of the 
Shannon. The total quantity of "bog-land" has been estimated at 2,831,000 acres; 
whereof 1,576,000 are flat red bog, capable of being reclaimed, and 1,255,000 acres monn- 
tain bog, mostly convertible into pasture land. The bogs are of several varieties, distin- 
guished according to the substances of which they are composed. The peat is found to 
rest on a blue clay, with a substratum of limestone gravel. The depth in some plac<^ i? 
40 feet, but 25 may be considered as a general average. In all cases the bogs are above 
the level of the sea, and their elevated situation is favorable to draining*^ 

Cba5/5.â€” The coastline of Ireland, including the estuaries of the great rivers, is about 
2,200 miles long. This extended line contains a great number of fine harbors and road- 
steads, chiefly in the north, south, and west coast, which being exposed to the full force 
of the Atlantic, are, as might be expected, indented by deep bays, protected by jutling 

f)romontories. These promontories are most numerous on the south-west coast, wbic-h 
ies in the direction of the prevailing winds, 'the east coast, on the contrary, has but one 
deep inlet or lough, with sufficient depth of water for every size of ships. The coast to 
the south of Dublin aflbrds no shelter for large ships ; and is besides rendered dangerous 
by the Shoals which extend along it, near the land. But with thi^ exception, the coasts 
of Ireland contain numerous harbors and inlets for the reception of smaller vessels ; up- 
wards of 70 well suited for the general purposes of commerce, and 14 capable of accom- 
modating large naval armaments. 

Rivers. â€” The Shannon is the largest of the Irish rivers. It rises firom the base of the 
Cuileagh Mountains, in thcnorth-westof Cavan, in a limestone cavern, fi-om which it issuer 
through a circular gulf, about 50 feet in diameter, and at once eissumes the character of 
a considerable river. It then flows through Lough Allen, Ree, and Derg, into the noble 
estuary which meets it below Limerick. From the head of Lough Allen to Limerick is 
144 miles, but the total length embracing the estuary is 214 miles. It is navigable to 
the head of Lough Allen ; but the depth is nowhere very great, and is in some places 
and at certain seasons a good deal obstructed. Large sums of money have been expended, 
partly in making lateral cuts and partiy in deepening the bed of the river at those places^ 



Dublin Idght-HoQM. . 

Lakes. â€” Ireland is a country of lakes. Lovgh Neag-h, the largest, is about 20 milei 
long and 10 in breadth, with a. superficies of nearly 109,000 acres. It is fed by nevcral 
rivers, and commtinieates with the sea through the Lower Bann. Ifa surface is 48 feet 
above the sea, and its depth 103 feet Its navigation ia rendered dangerous on account 
of frequent squalls and the want of harbors. Its waters are celebrated for thejt petrifying 
qnalitics. Lovgh Erne, in Fermanagh, consists of two lakes connected by a winding 
passage. It extends about 40 miles in length, and covers about 40,000 acres, Severm 
islands appear on its surface. Its elevation above the sea ia 150 feet, and it discharges 
itself by a rapid current of 9 miles, which terminates at the cataract of Ballyshannon. 
The Lakes of Kiharney lie in the midat of the mountains of Kerry, and are celebrated for 
their picturesque beauties more than for their extent. Lovgh Allen, Ree, and Derg are 
formed by the Shannon. Besides these, there are many other lakes in Ireland, at various 
elevations and as various in size, the total superficial area of which has been computed 
to amount 455,399 acres. 

Geology. â€” Though the physical and geological structure of Ireland is similar to that 
of England, still the relative geological positions of the rocks are essentially difl'erent. In 
Ireland, the coasts are for the most part mountainous, while the interior is flat, covered 
with rich and fruitful soil, and seldom presenting any considerable elevations. Carbonife- 
rous rock underlies the whole middle districts, while the .primary rocks are noted in the 
mountain tracts on the north-west coast and some few other situations. These districts 
contain rocks of the crystalline or igneous class, as well as those of the sedimentary. 
With the exception of granitfi, which is used as a valuable building stone, and some in- 
ferior slates, the only valuable rock, in an economical point of view, which occurs, is pri- 
mary limestone, which is burned into lime for manure. In some places, however, the 
limestone beds produce beautiful varieties of crystalline marble, and various colored ser- 
pentines, which are obtained in large blocks. Metaliferous veins permeate these districts, 
bat only a few have been worked. The great interior valley is composed of secondary 
rocks, consisting of old red sandstone, carboniferous limestone, coal, etc. Besides the coal 



144 iRELAl^. 

'vriiich occniB in thin and impure beds in the millstone-grit series^ there are six (Hlier cod 
districts which appear to belong to a distinct formation, the whole of which^ except tki 
of Antrim, rest upon the upper or splintery limestone. They contain two distinct kiads 
of coal, the anthracite and bituminous. The first, with the exception of the small beds in 
Antrim, are all situated to the south of Dublin ; the second, to the north of that Aj. 
The coal districts of other parts of Ireland are little known and have scarcely been wocked. 
Basalt, both tabular and columnar, occurs in the north, and covers a large aiea. The Gi- 
ant's Causeway is a specimen of the latter, as also the remarkable formations at Dood 
Point on the Island of Kathlin. Potters' clay is extensively spread over Tipperary and in 
some other parts. Throughout the central pcurts are vast accumulations of diluvial mas- 
ter, composed generally of clay and limestone gravel, in the form of low but steep hifls, 
which, under the name of " Eskers," circumscribe the bogs, and probably have b^ the 
means of their origin by confining the stagnant water above the level of the dry countiT. 
Mineral springs are numerous â€” most of them chalybeate. 

Soil and Productions. â€” The prevalent soil in Ireland is a fertile loam resting on a lime- 
stone foundation. The soil, though of no great depth, is sufficiently so for ail ag^ricultmil 
purposes, and yields well with proper care. Tipperary and Limerick possess an ext^ao^ 
dinary fertility. In some parts of Ireland the rocks rise above the surface in WBve-like 
succession, the interstices being *fiUed with rich mould, and covered with a ibidk close 
sward, which affords excellent pasturage. Large districts of grazing land are seldom met 
with. The only extensive tract of this description is the Curragh of Kildare, which has 
been used from time immemorial as a sheep-walk. The mountains are capable of tillage 
for a considerable height, and their summits, except in a few instances, afford an abun- 
dant pasture for sheep in summer. The vegetable and cereal productions are entirely the 
same as in England, the difference, being in the relative amount of the several staples. 
Potatoes and oats form a large moiety of the agricultural growths. 

Ireland was formerly entirely covered with vast forests, which, in the early period of its 
connection with England, formed the chief Obstacle to the progress of the invaders. Tbe 
roof of Westminster Hall is built of timber cut in the wood of Shillalagb. Trunks of 
large trees are frequentlv found in the bogs ; and even in the mountain tracts, which have 
long been devoted to sneep-walks, trees shoot up spontaneously whenever the land is a- 
cured from the intrusion of cattle. Timber is now scarce in Ireland, but the extension erf 
agricultural improvement, and more especially the " Timber Act," which gives the tenant 
an interest in the trees he may plant, are gradually remedying this important wxmt 

Climate. â€” The climate of Ireland is much milder and more equable than that of Eng- 
land. The winters along the western coast are especially mild, no doubt occasioned by 
the prevalence of the west winds. Frost and snow are not frequent, and are seldom of 
long continuance in the southern and south-western districts. In these, however, the fafls 
of rain are heavy during the autumn and winter. Notwithstanding the genera) mildness 
which prevails, and which preserves the verdure of the fields throughout the year, the sea- 
sons are generally later than in England. On the whole, the climate is well adapted to 
vegetation, and it is seldom that such famines as those which desolated the years 1846-7-8 
occur. These, however, were extraordinary years, and owed their short-comings to the 
loss of one staple â€” the potato â€” which suflfered alike in other parts of Europe, and 
also in America. 

Agriculture. â€” The agricultural system of Ireland has been, till lately, in the worst possible 
state. In the grazing counties farms were spread over thousands of acres, but in the 
counties where tillage is the chief occupation, they were very small, and often limited to 
two or three acres. These small patches were held at rack-rent by the miserable cultiva- 
tors, who derived from their labors only the scantiest and poorest subsistence for them- 
selves. In such circumstances improvement was out of the question, and besides, Ae 
peasaniry are so wedded to the ussiges of their forefathers, that no persuasion can induce 
them to adopt new and improved methods of increasing the products of their Cbuidb. 
Hitherto the indebtedness and want of enterprise and of the spirit of improv^nent, no 
less among the landlords than the tenants, have proved great obstacles to improvement ; 
but for this the change of property, now going on by the sale of encumbered estates, is 
likely to afford a remedy.

I^fpvIaHon. â€” The Irisll origiDsny belong to tbe Celtic stock, and a dialect of the Cel- 
Ho language', nearly akin to the Erne of Scotland, etill prevails in the south and west 
Since the conqnest by Henry IL, the Englieh and the English language have pervaded 
Ireland, bo that the present is a very mach mixed race. Many Scottiah families haTe 
also settled in Ulster, and have transfused mnch of their peculiar character into that por- 
tion of iite lAland. For centoriea the Irish have been treated as a conquered people : tbeii 
conntry has been parcelled out to strangers, whose descendants still live among them as 
starangers, or, as in namerone cases, spend at a distance the revenues they derive from the soil 
by means of hired servants or leasees, caring little for the improvement of the abject natives. 

The parliamentary censuses, the first of which was taken in 1811, exhibit the foUowing 
results:

1841 : 8,176,121 U1,7SB 5.7 

The census of 1851 exhibits a remarkable change, an index of a great si 
now going on in Ireland. By that census the population amounted to oi 
falling ofl^in tea years, of 1,660,330, carrying back the population to lesi! 
1821. The first cause of this diminution was the famine of 1846-8, oÂ« 
potato-disease. That famine not only destroyed a great number of the pec^ â€” , â€” . ., ^^,^ 
a vast impulse to the spirit of emigration to America, which had been gradually growing 
for several years previous, stimulated by remittances sent home by those who had already 
emigrated. Though the famine has ceased, and labor is now better paid in Ireland than 
it ever has been before, the emigmtion continues to be kept up on a very great scale, and 
the popolatioa still goes ou diminishing. But as Ireland is almost entirely an agrioultiB- 
ral country, and its people only skilled in the rudest kinds of hard labor, it has still a 
large surplus of population which it can part with and be benefited thereby 

jErportJ and Imports. â€” The exports are chiefly provisions. In the year e 
1852, there were ejcported to foreign countries, 70 hoises, 1,119 cwt of baa 
1,853 barrels of beef aad pork, 22,180 cwt of butter, 756 quarters (of 8 bus 
wheat and flour, 5,808 quarters of oats and oat-meal, 867 gallons of Irish a 
yards of linen, 8,668 lbs. of Unen yarn, 191,066 yards of cotton cloth ; i 
land and Scotland 183,760 oxen and cows, 2,474 calves, 151,807 sheep, 136,163 swine, 
95,116 quarters of wheat and wheat flour, and 1,141,976 quarters of oats and oat*meal. 
The foreign imports, entered for consumption in the same period, those that are imported 
directly into Ireland, were 499,131 gallons of wine, 202,498 gallons of foreign spirits, 
4,497,960 lbs. of tobacco, 6,573,278 lbs. of tea, 684,840 lbs. of coffee, 438,873 cwt of raw 
sugar, 28,828 cwt of refined sugar, 338.413 bushels of flaxseed and linseed, 5,138 lbs. 
of cotton, 1,393 lbs, of raw and thrown silk, 7 tons of iron, 78475 loads of solid timber, 
75,776 loads of sawn timber. The consumption of domestic spirits, during the same pe- 
riod, was 7,550,518 gallons, which paid an excise doty of ^Â£1,006,735.

2. Gibraltar. â€” Gibraltcur is an inconsiderable town, df some 12,000 inhabitants, biA 
upon the west side of Mount Calpe, one of the Pillars of Hercules, whidi rises abmpdj 
from the sea to the height of 1,439 feet, and is defended at every aooeseible point by ior* 
midable batteries. The mountain extends nearly three miles in length from north to sonft, 
and three-quarters of a mile in its greatest breadth, terminating in the sea at 'Boropa Point, 
and connected with the mainland by a flat, sandy isthmus 1,000 yards wide, but oolji 
few feet above the level of the sea. The south and east sides form a line of almost pa* 
pendicular precipices, but the south and west sides fall in rugged slopes, with ocoasioiial 
nats or terraces. It derives its name from Tarek, a Moorish general, who first built a ibii 
here in the 8th century. It was recovered from the Moors in 1462 b^ the Spaniaids, fiom 
whom, in turn, it was taken in 1704 by the English, who have retained it ey^r since. It 
is now so completely fortified as to be deemed impregnable, and has always a garrisoo 
of about 3,000 British troops. It derives its importance from its command of the entzaaoe 
into the Mediterranean Secu 

3. Malta. â€” Malta and its dependencies embrace a group of islands situated in tk 
Mediterranean Sea, abont 63 miles S. W. of Cape Passaro in Sicily, and extending, in a 
line from north-west to south-east, a length of 28 miles. MaUoy the largest, is of an ins- 
ular oval figure, about 16 miles in length by 8 or 9 in breadth, and is composed of cakÂ»- 
reous rocks, which slope like an inclined plane from the level of the sea towards tbe 
south and east, where they attain the elevation of nearly 200 yards. The surface is com- 
posed of small valleys, defiles, and hills, which extend across the Inreadth of the islaod. 
In most places the rock is* entirely naked, except where the hand of industry has placed 
over it a layer of earth, brought originally from Sicily and other places. Oozo, the most 
northerly, is more elevated than Malta. The surface is not so uneven, and is consequent!} 
more easily cultivated ; the pasture land is good, and great numbers of cattle are fed on 
it The grapes of Gozo are peculiarly fine. Cotton and grain are cultivated ^th success. 
Comino is a small island, two miles in length, between Malta and Gk)zo, and partakes 
most of the character of the latter. â€” Area of the islands, 213 square miles ; populafion, 
140,000. 

4. Ionian Islands. â€” These islands lie off tbe western coast of Ghreece, and are seven 
in number, namely : Corfu, Cephalonia, Zante, Santa Maura, Ithaca, Cerigo, and Paxo 
The area and population of each is noted in the following table : -Â»

Total, 1,079 219,677 

The inhabitants are, for the most part, Ghreeks ; but besides them, are many Italians, 
English, etc. The Gi^ek population is divided into three classes, the nobility, burghers, 
and peasantry. The nobility is not only possessed of nearly all the real estate, bat oc- 
oupy also the higher political and ecclesiastical offices. 

The surface of the islands is more or less mountainous; earthquakes occur finequently; 
the climate is unusually mild. The soil is comparatively rich in the fruits and pHrodocts 
of southern Europe, especially in olives, currants, and the vine. The rearing of cattle is 
rather insignificant The fabncating industry is restricted to some manufactures of silks, 
cottons, and linen. The commerce is very considerable ; of currants alone, nearly 20,000,000 
pounds are annually exported* The schools are in a very good condition. In 1883, a 
university was founded at Ck>rfu, which is frequented by 2^ or 300 students annnally ; 
and beside it, there are 2 gymnasiums, more than 60 elementary schools, etc

On the fall of the eastern empire, the Venetians afibrded protection to and claimed 
â– the sovereignty of these islands. The Turks strove hard to acquire tbem, without suc- 
cess. On the downfall of Venice the French seized upon them, but evacuated them on 
â– the breaking oat of the war in 1798-99, when they were taken under the joint posses- 
eioa of Russia and Turkey. By a secret treaty they were transferred to Napoleon by 
â– the Emperor Alexander, but during the continental war they were captured by Gnglantj^ 
cind at the peace of 1815 were allowed to remain under the protection of Great Britain. 



VHI. FRANCE. 

iSw/ufic. ^ Prance exhibits an advantageous commixtare of 
The gTeatei part of it is composed of river basins, separated by ; 
â– ^hich expand into plains as they approach the coast The most 
these basins is that of the Rhone, in the south-east, which stretches 
of latitude, from the sonrces of tbe Saone to the Gulf of Lyons, 
the basins of the Po and the Var by the Maritime and High Alps, 
Aar and Rhine by the Ranges of the Jura and Vosges mountains. 
ary of this extensive basin is formed by the Cevennes, a long range 
the eastern Pyrennees, and after running parallel with the Mediten 
divides into three branches. The most easterly branch continues i 
the course of the Rhone and Saone, and, after some interruptions, 
plain, (the plateau de Langres,) about 1,000 feet above Uie level of 
IB connected with the Vosges by a low chain of hills, called Mo 
completes the circuit of the basin. 

The other two branches of the Cevennes, known by the names of Forez, and the 
monntains of Auvergne, form, between them and the eastern branch, the vallies of the 
Allier and the Upper Loire, and are the eastern border of a high and hilly region, which 
decreases in elevation as it extends westward to the sources of the Charenton, from 
^Krhich point to the sea the country sinks into a low and level plain. 

The other river basins are almost as distinctly marked as those of the Rhone, the 
Allier, and the Loire, with this difference only, that the watersheds which bound them 
are formed by ranges of hills of very moderate elevation, and in some places even 
scarcely rising into hills ; but all connected more or less remotely with the great central 
and border mountains. The principal of these basins are those of the Loire and the 
Seine in the centre ; those of the Somme, Scheldt, Meuse, Moselle, and Rhine, in the 
north ; those of the Charenton, Dordogne, Garonne, Lot, Tarn, Adour, Aude, Herault, 
etc., in the soath-west and soath. 

Geology. â€” France contains formations of every description, from the non-fossiliferoas 
strata to those of tertiary and alluvial, and likewise igneous rocks, from the older granite 
and trap to the comparatively more recent extinct volcanic. The Alps and Pyrennees 
abound in mica slate and gneiss. In Bretagne is exhibited the older graywacke-slate. 
From the centra to the south of France, and in the north-east, the Silurian system is 
developed. 

The geology of France baa been brought most prominently into notice by the con- 
tents of its twtiary basin on vhich stands the city of Paris. The strata consist of foul 
principal masses. The first or lowest is a marine deposit; the second is firesh water; 
third marine again, and the fourth or upper, fresh water, evincing as many changes in 
the relative level of the sea and land. Tne lowest fresh water contains much gypsum 
or sulphate of lime, from which the plaster of Paris is made. From this mass of tha 



148 FEATfCE. 

group have been disinterred numerous organic remains of extinct animals. InTolTej 
among the volcanic products of Auvergne and in some other places, similar remain 
have been discovered in the tertiary stra^ 

Minerals^ coal^ etc. â€” There are thirt]^-8ix coal-fields in thirty departments. The mog: 
important are those of the Loire, which extend over an area of 42,000 acres, betwe^ 
the Loire and the Rhone, by which their products are conveyed to Marseilles, Paris, etc 
The next in importance are those of Nord, Saone, and Loire; Avignon, Grairde, Calva- 
dos ; the produce raised in the remaining departments is very small. Of late years the 
productiveness of the mines heua greatly Increased, but is yet very far from having- reached 
its limit In 1814, the annual quantity raised was less than 700,000 tons; nowii 
amounts to nearly 3,000,000 tons. In the production of iron, Prance ranks next to 
England. There are twelve distinct localities, or districts, in which the making of iron 
is prosecuted. The production of other metals is of little or no commercial importance. 
8alt is made in various parts ; but the principal place of production is the Salines de 
TEst, near the small town of Salines, in the departinent of Jura. Bay salt is evaporated 
on the southern coast. Mount Jura supplies asphaltum. The neighborhood of Paris 
abounds with quarries of freestone, and the houses of that city are chiefly constructed 
of this material. There are marble quarries in several of the mountain districts, but do< 
in situations to admit of exportation. The number of persons depending on roiniiip 
operations is about 300,000, and the annual value created by their labor may be esfr 
mated at $80,000,000. 

Climate. â€” The climate of Prance, though varying much in different localities, is m 
general genial, and well-adapted to extensive ancf profitable agriculture. In the north- 
west it assimilates in some degree to that of England, and rain is frequent. Here tbe 
country is well-adapted to pasturage ; and as in England, the principal objects of culture 
are wheat, bariey, oats, rye, and such fruit as apples, pears, and cherries ; also hemp, flax, 
and rape-seed. It is in this division of Prance alone that the natural pastures are rich 
and extensive. In the central regions, with the exception of the mountain districts, the 
winters are short and mild ; and, along with the more hardy grains, maize is cultivated, 
and the vine flourishes. The weather here is more steady than in the north. In sum- 
mer there is littie rain, and storms, when they occur, are frequently accompanied with 
hail ; but on the whole, the temperature is, perhaps, the most pleasant in France, being 
exempt from all extremes. The climate of the southern districts approaches that d 
Italy and Spain. The heat of the summer mid-day is oppressive, and irrigation is ne- 
cessary for the purposes of agriculture. The whole country is thickly-planted with the 
vine, which here finds its natural climate and soil. The common fruits are the olive and 
the mulberry ; and in a few of the warmer situations, the orange and lemon. Groud 
pasture is found only on the hills or in the well-irrigated plains. 

Scenery. â€” The scenery of Prance, devoid of all ornamental plantations and of the 
thick-set hedges which are seen in England, is to an unusual degree tame and irk:<orae, 
and the traveller in vain Iqpks for the cheerftil and varied aspect so characteristic of 
England. The fresh pastures and gentie eminences of Normandy are exceptions, and 
are truly beautiful. Picardy, Poictou, and Champagne consist of wide, uninteresting 
levels, while Auvergne, Upper Languedoc, and the vicinity of the Alps and the Pyren- 
hees contain bold but bleak scenery. The most picturesque views are found in Limousin^ 
or on the borders of the great rivers. The banks of the Loire, from Orleans westward, tire 
proverbially beautiful. The Rhone, which is bordered by mountains, presents generally 
a bold aspect, varied occasionally with gloomy wildness. The Seine flows through ver- 
dant but less striking scenery. 

Soils. â€” The area of Prance is approximately distinguished into the following charac- 
ters is relation to its soils: â€” 

Mouotain country , . 8 Soil of Sandy. 10 

Landes , 10 J " ciaj 5 

Soil of rich mould 14 " marsh and swan^ Oj

FBANCE. 149 

One-half is arable ; 9 parts meadow ; 4^ vineyards ; 16 woods and forests ; 15 down^, 
pastures, and heaths, eta ; the remainder beiog occupied in a variety of ways, or con- 
sisting of cities, roads, caoaK Â®tc. 

Agriculture^ etc. â€” The soil is, upon the whole, fertjle ; yet there are also many barren 
and desert tracts, together amounting to 7,799,673 hectares,, or 30,279 square miles (nearly 
one-seventh of the total area of France). Of the arable land, about 14,000,000 hectares 
(or 54,346 square miles) are appropriated to grain-raising; and in 1843 there were 
5,338,043 hectares (257^ hectares are nearly equal to one English square mile) cultivated 
with wheat, of wnich.a greater quantity is produced than in any other European 
country ; 2,638,948 with rye ; 1,300,186 with Parley ; 2,840,360 with oats ; 700,890 
with buckwheat ; and 595,227 with maize and millet Upon an average, the annual 
produce is about 333,000,000 bushels of grain, 128,000,000 of which consist of wheat ; 
beside which, the annual harvest of potatoes may be computed at 170,000,000 bushels. 
All the grain raised in the countrv is, at times, not sufficient for home consumption ; and, 
in the period from 1815 to 1841, grain was imported from foreign countries to the 
amount of 464,000,000 francs in value. The agriculture in France in generally in a back- 
w^ard state, or at least inferior to that of England, Belgium, and Germany. 

Next to wheat, the most important pf aU the vegetable productions of France is the vine, 
the cultivation of which extends, noore or less generally, over the half of the country^ 
beginning as far north ets Champagne, and spreading over the country to the south and 
the west The cultivation, however, is limited, north of 45 deg. From the great variety 
of the soil and climate, French wines differ greatly in quality and flavor ; and it is only 
in the extreme south that the be^t are procured. Since the commencement of the present 
century the demand for this article has greatly increased, and as a consequence, its pro- 
duction has been stimulated to an ext^^rdinary extent It is computed that 5,000,000 
acres are now planted with vines, anid that the annual value of wines and spirits pro- 
duced varies little from $130,000,000 ; of which only an eighteenth part is exported. 
The best brandy is distilled in the vicinity of the Graronne. Other productions of the vege- 
table kingdom are, principally: madder (in the environs of Avignon and other parts of 
Provence, and in Languedoc) ; sugar-beets (of which at least 82,000,000 lbs. of sugar are 
made annually) ; olives (renowned is the olive-oil from Provence) ; tobacco (cultivated only 
in Brittany, Gascony, French Flanders, and Alsace, the tobacco-trade being a monopoly 
of the government) ; capers, almonds, and truffles. 

The rearing of cattle is in France, even more tban*agriculture,in a backward state, and 
in 1843 the total number was only 9,130,632. The best breed is that of Normandy and 
Auvergne. For the home consumption, the cattie reared in France are not found sufficient 
The number of horses throughout the country is estimated at 2,500,000 ; the finest breed 
is to be found in Normandy and Limousin, but even these horses are inferior to those of 
Mecklenburg, Oldenburg, and other parts of GSermany, from which countries numerous 
horses are annually imported to remount the French cavahry. In Poitou and Auvergne 
are reared fine mules. The numbers of sheep (the finest breed is in Berry) amounted, in 
1843, to 29,130,231. Of goats, the fine breed from Angora and Thibet, introduced into 
France since 1819, thrives well in the southern provinces. In these provinces the rear> . 
ing of silk-worms is also very important 

^fore the revolution of 1789, France had extensive and valuable forests ; but they 
have since been thinned so extravagantly that in 1843 no more than 7,422,315 hectares, 
or only about the seventh part of the total area of France, were still wood-land ; of which, 
moreover, only the fourteenth part consisted of forests of tall trees. 

There is no country where landed proper^ is so much divided as in France ; and an 
indefinite division will be the consequence oi the present laws of devise. Each child re* 
oeives an equal share of the father's lands on his death, and tims from year to year the 
fonns are cut up. The consequence of this is, that the French are a nation of small farm- 
as, and the abilities of each to introduce improvements circumscribed. To occupy a farm 
of 200 acres, places a man in the foremost rank of farmers. Larger possessions are com- 
mon in the pastoral districts, but such districts are rare ; and in the greater part of the 
country the farms under tillage are of 50, 40, 30, 30, or even 10 acres ; there being, it is 
computed, not less than. 3^000^000 of 8U(m petty occupants. 



150 FRANCE. 

The peasantry of France are extremely illiterate, but are by no means slow or phW 
matic. They exhibit, like the rest of their countrymen, no small degree of sprigbtliD*^3 
and activity in the individual, with very little concert or combination in the mass. Th? 
houses of the farmers, and still more those of the cottages, are poor, dirty, and comfort- 
less ; their implements are rude ; their harrows have wooden teeth, and even*tbe ploaghs, 
in some less-cultivated districts, are almost entirely of the same materiaL The com aad 
hay is stacked, but not housed ; and the winnowing machine is nearly, and the threshing 
machine wholly, unknown. Threshing with a flail, or trampling out the seed by horses 
or mules, are still prevdent The food of the peasantry is exceedingly simple, and tk 
villages they inhabit are often ill-situated and ill-built 

Manufactv/res. â€” Arts and manufactures have experienced a more rapid developmem 
than agriculture. Steam-power is now generally applied. Immense progress has beai 
made in the arts of metallurgy, dyeing, the preparation of animal substances, and in tto 
weaving of various kinds of cloth ; but it is in the manufacture of cashmeres and dam- 
asks, paper, watches and clocks, fine and common pottery, in lithography, in dyeing silks 
and cotton thread and tissue ; in paper-staining, ; cutting and polishmg crystals ; the 
fabrication of arms and the preparation of chemical substances, that the greatest progrea 
and improvement has been efltected. Coal-mining has been greatiy extended, and the 
establishment of a great number of furnaces, the introduction of neated air into the pro- 
cess of smelting, and the use, which is becoming daily more general, of iron in building?, 
have given a lively impulse to the iron-trade. 

The woollen manufacture is one of the oldest and most widley diffused. The doib 
of Sedan, in Champagne, and Louviers, in Normandy, are of the finest quality. The 
mountain-districts of Languedoc, which contain immense flocks of sheep, are the seat oi 
the manufactures of serges, tricots, and other coarse woollens ; a great part of which is 
made at home during the intervals of out-door labor. Rheims is the chief seat of a hi^j 
finished species of woollen manufacture, that of shawls, veils, ladies' doth, etc Similar 
articles are made at Paris ; and the It^ench shawls, in particular, now rival in beantr 
those of Persia and the East 

The cotton manufacture was first introduced in 1770, and since 1812 has probaUj 
tripled in extent and importance. The principal districts engaged in this branch are 
Rouen and the adjacent towns in Normandy ; Lyons and Tarrare ; Lille, Cambray, aod 
other places in French Flanders ; P|ris and its neighborhood ; St Quentin, Abbeville, 
Amiens, and other towns in Picardy ; Troyes and the adjacent towns in Chaxn]>agoe ; 
Mulhausen, Bischweiller, and other places in Alsace. The total number of persons em- 
ployed seems to be 250,000. 

A large number of people are engaged in the linen manufacture. In the north partico- 
larly, every farmer covers a littie spot with hemp or flax, sufficient to employ his wife 
and daughters in spinning during the year. The whole of Normandy is engaged, more or 
less, in this important branch of industry. Coarse linens, canvas, and sacking are made 
in Bretagne ; but Anjou affords a superior article ; the toiles of Laval have long been in 
repute, and give employment to more than 26,000 men. At Lille, about 50,000 hands 
are employed in fine fabrics, and* in the spinning of thread. Fine linens are mano&c* 
tured at St Quentin, and employ about 40,000 persons. Cambric, thread, gauze, and 
lawn, rank among the leading manufactures of the north-east of France ; and lace, of the 
most exquisite descriptions, is produced in large quantities at Valenciennes, Dieppe, Alo}- 
^on, Caen, Bayeux, and Argentan. There are also large manufactures of printed linens ; 
and the dyeing of liiien thread gives rise to an extensive trade. At Boueji this branch is 
carried on, and linen articles of great variety are there produced. 

The manufacture of paper has long been preeminent in France, and the finest descrip- 
tions are produced. 

In the manufacture of silk, France bears the palm firom the rest of Europe. Molbeny 
trees, which are indispensable for the support of the sift-worm, were introduced in the 
15lh century, and were first planted near Tours. It is now common to twelve depart- 
ments. Besides the native product, much silk is imperiled, chiefly from Italy. The manu- 
facture is considered important, and is most kLigelv cajrried on in Paris and Lyons; in 
the latter city it gives employment to 60,000 or 70,000 persons. 



FRANCE. Ifl] 

Leather is manofactored to the yeaily value of 6S/X)0,000 firanoe. Jewehry, and watch 
and clock work, are made chiefly in Paris. Paris is, indeed, remarkable for every falNcio 
of taste and luxury. The porcelain of St. Sevres, and the beautifdl but expensive tapes- 
try of Gobelins, are hifffaly vahied. Soap, oil, liquors, hats, perfumery, earthen-ware, salt- 
petre, and other chemical articles, are also manufactured to a large extent In the manu- 
facture of the finer chemicals, especially the vegetable alkaloids, the French have long 
excelled, and their articles have a preference in all markets. The total computed value 
of goods manufactured in Frahoe is al>oat 1,600,000,000 francs annually. Trade is much 
more confined, however, to home consumption than in England. The only articles im- 
ported largely are cotton and silk ; little is exported ; and, as a consequence, the produc- 
tive industry is not so liable to fluctuations as in countries depending on others as cus- 
tomers. 

Fisheries. â€” The fisheries of France maybe divided into three classes: the home- 
fisheries; the cod-fisheries, on the banks of Newfoundland; and the whale-fisheries. 
Along the north coasts cod, mackerel, herring, and pilchards abound. On the Atlantic and 
Mediterranean, great quantities of sardines are caught. On some parts of the coast, the 
inhabitants derive their chief subsistence from oysters and muscles. Lobsters are also 
abundant The home-fisheries, being littie calculated for forming seamen, have been 
neglected ; while repeated attempts have been made by the government to extend the 
cod-fishery of America. Enormous pecuniary bounties have been allowed for its encour- 
agement, but still with Uttie success. The fisberv is not flourishing, and depends, even for 
existence, on the favor of government The whale-fishery was established in 1784, and 
is still carried on under a system of bounties, with almost as littie success as the cod- 
fishery. Havre is the chief dep6t of the whalii^ business. 

Cotnmerce. As a commercial nation France is only second-rate, and vastiy inferior to 
either Great Britain or the United States. The productions of industry, as well as those 
of the soil, ^ve rise to a large internal commerce, but with foreign countries exchange is 
comparatively limited. Thp most important commerdal towns are Paris, Lyons, Bouen, 
St Etienne, Ibeaucaire, Aix, Toulouse, Montpelier, Lille, Strasbourg, Nancy, Mulhausen, 
and Perpignan. The inland commerce is chiefly transacted at fairs, which are held pe- 
riodically m all the great towns in the country, and the facility and cheapness of knd- 
carriage, by railroads, etc., are peculiarly beneficial to the merchant The extent of the 
business effected cannot weU be asoertamed. The chief articles of import from foreign 
countries are horses, cattie, raw-silk, tallow, peltry, wool, leaf-tobaoco, dye woods, oil, va- 
rious metals, hemp, cotton, indigo, sulphur, colonial produce, and spices. The principal 
exports consist of the manufactures of the country, wines, brandies, perfrunery, etc, with 
fruits and confectionery. Paris itself frimishes more than a fifth part of the whole. 
The ports are Marseilles, Le Havre, Bourdeaux, Roohelle, Dunkerque, Bologna, Dieppe, 
Bavonne, etc. The average annual value of exports from 1835 to 1833 was $130,000,- 
000 ; and of the imoorts, $124,000,000. By 1846 the exports had risen to $230,000,000, 
and the imports to $250,000,000, and they have since increased. 

The distribution of the foreign commerce of France, and the amount of transactions 
with each country, is exhibited in the following table, which is abstracted from the 
^ Tableau Grenerai du Commerce de France" for 1846, published by the administration 
of Commerce at Paris : â€”

Railroads^ etc. The avenues of internal communication in France ate entrusted to 
tbe management of the board of roads, bridges and mines. The business connected 
with this board is veiy extensive, and looks to the general safety of the great travelling 
public The corps of engineers of roads and bridges is composed chiefly of the most 
distinguished pupils of the **Ecole Polytechnique." The country is divided into 12 in- 
spections, entrusted to division inspectors, and under iiiese are chief engineers, who reside 
in the principal towns of the departments composing the inspections respectively. There 
are in fVance 28 high roads, which are well kept ; 97 departmental roads, and a great 
number of cross or country roads. The high roads extend altogether 8,623 leagues; de- 
partmental roads, 8,505 â€” in aU, 26,792 leagues, or about 72,W0 miles. The railroads 
of France centre at Paris, and thence divei^e to every point In 1842, the French 
government resolved that a system of railways should be planned and executed. With 
this view, it was determineil that from Paris, as a centre, main branch lines should issue, 
to be directed to those points of the frontier, by land and by sea, that should best serve 
the purposes of foreign commerce. The total length of seven lines, connecting Paris 
with the Atlantic and Mediterranean, and withthe Belgian, Swiss, G^erman, Italian and 
Spanish frontiers, is 4,337| miles. Of t^is sum about four-sevenths was (July 1852) 
completed and in operation. For tibese lines tiie expense borne by the State amounts in 
its grand aggregate, to $43,000,000. But, as the State will, at that date, have received 
from the various companies the sum of $31,000,000, the actual outlay of the State 
will be reduced to the sum of $12,000,600. It is believed that unless some unforeseen 
events should intervene to prevent, the whole system will be completed by the end of the 
year 1859.

Excess In &Tor of 1852 $4,788,056 

This excess of nearly five millions of doUan in iiie receipts of tbe year 1852 over tbbee 
of 1851 is to be attributed moslly to the completion or extension, during tbe year 
1852, of several of the most important lines of railways radiating fix>m tbe capital to 
the frontiers. Tbe eastern railway from Paris has been opened to Strasbourg on ibe 
Bhine, and several sections completed on the Western railroad and on those destined to 
connect Bordeaux, Marseilles, and Lyops with P^iis* The number of additional miles of 
railwav opened to tmvel and traffic during tite year 1852, throughout tbe whole empire, 
was 249 miles. , 

Population. At the end of the seventeenth centory the population of France was 
stated at nearly 20,000,D0a In 1791, a census exhibited it at 26,363,600. The progiess 
of population has been as exhibited in the following table:â€”

Of these, belonging to the first class, 5,591,000 are in a state of ignorance, most of them 
unable to read and write, and in the fourth class there is also a sad deficiency of knowl- 
edge, as out of 1000 recruits, 500 do not know their alphabet The mean duration of 
life is 32.6 years ; before the first revolution it was stated by Duvillard at 28^ years, 
proving that a favorable change has taken {dace in the law of mortality, and ttiat a 
greater degree of comfort has been enjoyed by the people since that period. 

Religion. Three fourths of the French profess the Koman Catholic Religion ; all re- 
ligions, however, are protected. About 1,000,000 belong to the Reformed Church, the 
majority of whom are in the southern departments. The Jews are met with in the large 
cities. In Doubs and Vosges there are a few Auabaptiists, and a new sect, calling them* 
selves the French Church, nas lately appeared : they do not acknowledge the authority 
of the Pope, and have their liturgy in French. 

There are 14 Roman Catholic archiepiscopal provinces, and 66 bishoprics, altogether 
80 dioceses. The dioceses are generally co-terminate with the departments, but in several 
cases a diocese includes two or more of the civil divisions. 

The Protestants who adhere to the Confession of Augsbu]^, or the Lutherans, have 
a general consistory, the seat of which is Strasbourg, and six inspections. The Re- 
formed Protestants or Calvinists have consistories, of which five form a synod, and 
churches in* fifty-five departments. They have a faculty of theology at Montau* 
bon. The Jews have a central consistory at Paris, and consistorial synagogues at 
Strasbourg, Colmar, Metz, Nancy, Bordeaux, and Marseilles. Salaries are paid out of 
the public treasury, and amount to between 3,600,000 to 4,000,000 firancs a year. Car- 
dinaJs have about $6,600, ardibishops (4,000, and bishops $3,000 annual salaries. The

Catholic clergy number about 38,000 ; Lutheran about 400 ; Calvinists about 350; aod 
Jewish about 100. There are neariy 4000 Convents, containing 24,000 inmates, of 
whom 18,000 are nuns, devoted to the care of the sick, and the education of children. 

Education. â€” The University of France embraces the whole system of national efc 
cation, and includes all the educational institutions of the country, from the lowe^ 
'schools up to the greatest colleges. The supervision is entrusted to a conndl,a]Klt 
corps of inspectors, and each commune is obliged by law to support schools for eleffieo- 
tary instruction. The number of institutions belonginj? to tlie university, vitals latdyas 
follows : 41 national colleges, with 626 professors, 5,779 internal, and 8,870 external stu- 
dents; 318 communal colleges; 146 institutions; 1,114 boarding-schools; 54 ncHHttl 
schools ; and 42,318 primary schools. 

The hijghest rank is that of the ^ Facultes." There are six ^^Facultes" of Boaon 
Catholic Theology, and two of Protestant Theology, one Lutheran, and one Calvinistk. 
There are nine Facultes of law ; three of medicine, with 17 secondary schools ; eight 
of science, and six of literature. The facultes of Paris are highly distinguished, and 
are attended by a large body of students. No student is eligiUe to tiie fieicaltes of hw, 
physic, or divinity, until he has received diplomas in science and literature. The ckiSQi

Armi/ and Navy. â€” The gradations of military rank are â€” sub-lieutenant, lieutenant, 
captain, chief d'escardron, colonel, marechal de camp, lieutenant-general, and marshal 
of Prance. Promotion cannot be purchased as in England, and not often obtained by 
special ' order : â€” more than half the promotions take place by seniority. The number 
of marshals of Prance, the highest officers in the army, is nxed at eight in time ol 
peace, and may be increased to twelve in time of war. The army in its entirety 
amounts in general to between 300,000 and 500,000 men ; but in time of wwt cmy 
fVenchman is liable to conscription. 

Next to Great Britain, Prance has the most powerful navy in the world. The an- 
nexed table wiU exhibit the number and capacity of each class of vessels in 1845, wUch

For military porposes France is diyided into twenlynme provinces, styled military di* 
isions. The chi^ of these are lieutenant-generals, who have muler them as many 
ield-marshals as there are departments in their respective divisions, and under the com* 
nand of these officers are placed the troops in ea!ch department The administration 
levolves on a Ck>rps d'Intendance, and in the cental of each division there is an In* 
endant, and a suMntendant in each sub-division. 

The maritime regions are divided into five arrondissements, which are again sub- 
livided into quartiers. A maritime prefect, who takes charge of the ports, is stationed 
n each arrondissement, and supervises the whole coast d^enoe of his district. The 
bits and naval stations are hignlv distinguished for their efficiency, and some of the 
(trong^holds are reckoned among the most secure in Europe. The fortifications of Paris 
ind Lyons are instances of such. The whole number of fortified places is 131 ; of 
^hich, 21 are of the first dass, 48 of the second, and 52 of the third. The chief naval 
stations and dock-yards are those of Brest, Toulon, Bochefort, Cherbourg, and 1/ Orient 

Legion of Honor. ^^Ab connected principally, though not exclusively, with the army 
ind navy, we may mention the ^ Order of the Legion of Honor," which was instituted 
>y Napoleon. The usual titie to admission is the discharge of important duties, either 
uvil or military, and in time of war the performance of some act of great bmvery. The 
grades are: â€” 1. Chevaliers, of whom the number is unlimited; 2. Officers, limited by 
;he laws of the order to 2,000; 3. Commanders, limited to 400; 4. Grand Officers, to 
L60 ; and 5. Grand Crosses, to 80. These laws, however, have been superseded, and a 
a^^ number of officers instituted. The ordex embraces from 50,000 to 60,000 in alL 
Their reward is the ^ honor of the thing," and sundry decorations. 

Oovemmeni. â€” The great events in the recent history of France, and indeed, of 
Bnrope, are the revolution of 1848, by which France was transformed into a republic, 
EoUowed by the revolutions of Dec., 1851, and of Nov., and Dec., 1852, by which Lords 
Napoleon converted himself^ first into a ^resident for life, and then into an emperor. 
Under the new regime the liberties of FVance, including the liberty of the iÂ»ress, are 
totally trodden undior foot Everything depends on the will of the emperor, who finds 
in the support of the army, of the catholic clergy whom he has labored to conciliate, and in 
llie ^nend terror of revolution, the buttresses of his authority. That authority, however, 
rests on so precarious a foundation, and the whole system of administration is liable to 
Â»uch sudden changes, tiiat it is hardly worth while to go into details respecting it It may, 
tiowever, be observed in general, that the imperial government preserves, and pushes to 
extremes, that centralizing system first introauced by jthe Jacobins, perfected by the first 
Bonaparte, preserved by tm uie subsequent governments, and which by its operation and 
tendency, oeprives the citizens of all direct share in the management of even local 
ofiiBdrs, accustoming them to look {at every thing to the guidance and guardianship of 
the government 



VBB EMPIRA OF' BITBSIA. 



IX. EMPIEE OF EUSSIA. 



Extent. â€” This extensive and ponnerfnl empire, fiat edipeiBg.in its temtorial e a cpm ao n 
every other nation of ancient or modem times, compnses tke .whole nortbem porlicm of 
the eastern hemisphere, from the Ghilf of Bothnia and the frontisis of Posea on tbe ivest, 
to the Pacific Ocean and Behrin^s Straits on the east ; and extends theooe to tbe Ameri- 
can continent, on which it has euso a considerable territory. Within these Kmits is an 
area of nearly 8,000,000 square miles, equal to the whole of North America, or about a 
sixth part of the land of the globe. 

European Russia, from the most southerly point of the Crimea to the north coast cf 
Lapland, or the mouth of the White Sea, is 1,720 miles; and from the western border of 
Poland to the 60th meridian, along the S2d parallel, 1,791 miles, Tbe superficial area is 
estimated at 2,021,887 square miles, or more than one-half of the wh<de of Europe. 

Surface.-^Wiih the exceptionof a small territory in the nortli-weet,tlie whole of this exten* 
sive country belongs to the great plain which exteads thtoogfa the Huddle of Europe, from 
tbe Grerman Ocean to the Caspian Sea and the Oural MbunStedos. It is not, however, pe^ 
fecUy level, for there are at least three distinct slopes, down which its waters are oaiiied 
to the adjoining seas. The main watershed, which is only a few hundred feet in efeva- 
tion, may be traced from a spur of the Carpathians, near the source of the Dniester, is 
an irregular north-eastern and eastern course, to the Ourals, tmwt the source of tiie Pel- 
ohora. The greatest elevation is in the Valdai Hills, wteie its highest point is 1,370 feet 
above the level of the sea. The northern slope, which forms the basin of the White Ses, 
has a barren soil and a severe climate. The southern slope may foe divided iato tfaee 
regions : Central Russia, the Steppes, and tbe country beyond tbe Volga. 

Central Russia, extending firom the Carpathian Mountains and tiie western limits of 
Pbland to the banks of the Volga, with a breadth of about eleven degrees of latitude^ 
improves progressively towards the south, the southern half being a country of great kst* 
tility. Between this fertile region and the Caspian and Black Seas, extend the *^ Steppes,** 
yrhich are usually divided into the higher and the lower. Tbe former extend we^wud 
from the Don, along the Sea of Asov and the Black Sea, indnding three fourths of the 
Crimea, cross the Dnieper, and spread westward along its right bank until tbey meet the 
outskirts of the fertile regions of Little Russia. Their surftice is, in general, not more than 
200 ft above the level of the sea, and througbont is covered with a long coarse grass, vAiA 
feeds immense droves of horses, but is unsuited for cattle. In tbe hollows of the riven, 
however, and in some other places, cultivation is profitable; and in tbe Crimea, the whole 
surface of the Steppes is covered with plants, whose gaudy blossoms fill the sJr with re* 
freshing fragrance. The lower Steppes extend along the shores of the Caspian, from the 
Oural to the foot of tbe Caucasus, with a breadth of 960 or 300 miles. Tbe surface in 
the mountain districts is covered with a fine sand mixed with shdls, entirely denuded of 
vegetable growths ; and tbe soil is everywhere impregnated widi salt, wluk the lakes 
which occur in it yield a quantity of that article, in summer, sufficient to supply the 
greater part of Russia. The country to tbe east of the Volga is hilly and even monih 
tainous, being traversed by the spurs of the Ourals. Tbe elevated parts are covered wiih 
forests^ but in the valleys the soil is modemtely fntile. "Wie third slope, which inclines 
to the Baltic, extends from the borders of Prussia to the Gulf of Finland and the hikes 
liAdoga and Onega, and is in general a country of moderate fertility, interspersed wifii a 
number of lakes, and containing some s&uidy tracts, intermixed with portions of rich soiL 
The centre of Finmark is an elevated plateau, ftdl of lakes, and covered with low rocky 
heights. Lapmark is exceedingly, barren, but the valleys among the mountains in ilie 
southern parts of Finland, contain rich m^adows and good arable land. The coasts of 
Finland are lined with pveoipioes, reefb, and rocky islands ; and in some parts of the low* 
lands, the surface is overspread with enormous blocks of granite. 

Geologyâ€” The predominant geological formations are the tertiary and aUuvial, â€” tie 
older formations being less frequent. Primitive and transition rocks, however, occur in 
the Ourals, Finland, and some other places ; and the secondary rocks frequently appear 
rising, like small islands, in the great plain ; and among the formations of this class are 



SMPIBE: CMP RIJISSIA. 157 

coal, lime, gjrpstim, chalk, and dalt. l^e tertiary formations occupy yast tracts of low 
coontry. The allnyial formations consist of an old and a new deposit ; the former com- 
posed of a great stratum of marlj clay and loam, interspersed with numerous blocks of 
ffraaite and other primitive rodks. It covers vast tracts of Poland. The soil which it 
iWms in the south of Poland is excellent, but towards the north it becomes gradually less 
productive, and more mixed with sand, gravel, and large blocks. Vast numbers of these 
blodcs occur in this plain, which are beUeved to have been transported from Finland by 
some great flood. 

The great mineral riches of the empire are found in the Oural and Altai mounteuns ; 
those in European Russia are few and unimportant A tract, howeyer, called the Central 
Mining Distnet, esctends from the Oka to the Kaluga, vi^hich is for the most part poor 
aad sandy, but contains iron ore ; and as the metal is manufactured in the places where 
it is found, severed extensive iron works have been erected in this region. The works at 
Petrozavodsk, and near St Petersbra^, are the largest in Europe. Rnland yields copper 
and tin, and coal is found in various places m small quantities. In southern Poland are 
numerous beds of Intuminous coal, sometimes thirty feet thick* In the tertiary districts, 
deposits of brown coal are met with, which likewise yield amber. Salt mines are found 
in several districts ; but the greatest quantity is procured from the lakes and marshes 
north of the Caspian Sea. The principal saltworks are in the neighborhood of Soli* 
kamsk ; and the ^psnm grottoes of Koungo^, in the government of Perm, are large 
and magnificeht In Poland there are large mines of rock-salt, which fojm part of that 
enormous layer of fossil-salt which extends along the Carpathian Mountains, and which 
is large enough to supply the whole woiid^for an indefinite period. Copper sand is found 
throughout a large extent of oountry in* the govetoments of Perm, Vialka, and Ufa, 
completely skirting the south and west sides of the Ourals. The sand is of a dull-red 
or green color, and is worked for copper; it contains also fossil wood impregnated with 
tlie metal 

It is in the Asiatic territory of Russia, however, that the most abundant mines of cop- 
per are found, as well as those of gold, silver, platina, and other metals. 

ClinuUe.-^The climate of Russia presents a variety proportionate with its extent 
Its geographical position indicates extremes botli of heat and coM, and the winters are 
much more severe and the summer more warm tiian in other parts of Europe in the same 
latitudes. These g^oieral remarks, however, are ina^^cable to some localities. In 
the south the winters are Aott and the summers long and powerful. The middle re- 
gion, from 50 de^. to 57 deg., has a rough and long-continued winter, especially towards 
the east; and at Moscow, latitude 56 de^., the mean temperature of the yÂ«ar is only 40 
deg. Fahr., while that of the hottest mon% rises to 70 degÂ« In the northern regions, from 
57 deg., the climate, though milder than in Asia, is mudi more severe than in Western 
Europe. The winter is here long, and vioknt winds prevail for seven months. The au- 
tumn is foggy, and in the coldest montiis mevcury freezes. The duration of winter at St 
Petersburg extends from September to May. The seasons and weather, however, de- 
pend greatly on the course of the winds and other collateral drcumstances. On an aver- 
age, ^0 days are reckoned to bdong to winter; and for 160 of these, the waters are fast 
bound with ice. 

Soil^etc. â€” A broad belt of vegetable soil, in some places from three to five feet deep, 
extends through central and soothem Russia^ from Volhynia to the Ourals. This land is 
ao productive as not to require manure, and its fertility is proved by the large returns of 
grain which it yields, and the excellent breeds of oattie that are raised upon it. Considered 
generally, the territory between 44 deg. and 50 deg. is, for the most part, low and level, 
scantily wooded, partly very fruitful and partly barren, and here and there impregnated 
vinth salt. The mildest and most fertile rmoQ, however, is that succession of valleys 
aloiig the southern coast of the Crimea, whare the vine and garden fixiits,'Of excellent 
quality, are produced in such abundance, as to form an artide of commerce as far as 
Moscow. Proceeding eastward into the government of Astrakan, only that part of the soil 
IB fertile which extends along the kyw banks of the Volga, the Oural, and the Tere^, in which 
tracts vegetables attain an enormous sixe. The sofl is beare impregnated with saline and 
bituminous substances. Higher Â«p, the land on the Volga beoomes sandy and unproduc*

The middle region, from 50 deg, to 57 deg., is the wealthiest and most densely peofied

slow-growing wood succeeds, and beyond 67 deg., only dry, stunted shrubs. 

The Russian forests are of enormous extent, and yield the most important prodood, 
supplying in profusion timber, tar, pitch, potash, and turpentine, which form a priodpii 
part of the commercial exports, and furnish fad in a country nearly destitute of oetl 
Of the entire country, one-nfth is occupied by forests, the same amount by uncoltivalcd 
lands, waters, and cities, three-tenths by arable, eind the remainder by meadow lands. 
Of the woodland, one-half is covered with pines, firs, and other coniferous trees. Oaks,beeeiL 
poplars, and elms are chiefly found south of 52 deg., but the birch grows in more nort^ 
em regions. These immense forests are a great blessing to so rigorous a climate, as tter 
afford a plentiful fuel, and shdter from the cold piercing winds firom the north. He 
provinces of the south are almost destitute of timbcor. The trees furnish timber of the &â€¢ 
est and most durable quality for building and furniture ; and the exportation of timba 
constitutes no inconsiderable branch of Russian commerce. 

Agriculture y etc. â€” The most common grains are rye and oats; but in southern Bossa 
the best wheat, with millet and rice, are produced, H^oip and flax are also la^y culti- 
vated. While com and cattle constitute the wealth oi Central Russia, the south abounds 
in productions of a more precious and delicate kind. There the vine is indigeooos, wai 
its cultivation, especially in the Crimea, has been wdl attended to ; but the wines pro- 
duced are neither remarkable for their flaviur nor quality. Vine cultivation extends ofer 
Astrakan, Kherson, Podolia, the country of the Don Cossacks, Taurida, and the Canca- 
sus. The mulberry tree has received the same attention, and with more favorable resotts 
Large plantations have been formed near all the large towns, and evary enoomagement 
has been held out by the Government to the growers. Sugar-cane and indigo have abc 
been introduced. There is besides, in southern Russia, a great variety of fruits and Teg^ 
tables ; and in summer the country everywh^e presents the most enchanting appearance^ 
and is covered with a profusion of the finest fbwers and aromatic herbs. Russia also 
produces hops, tobacco, and the ordinary garden vegetables of Europe. Spanish pepper 
is raised on the Volga; the poppy, in Kharkoff; r&ibarb grows wild in Taurida; rka* 
pontick, in the Ourals ; and the polygonum*minus, whidi g^ows wild in the Ukraine. 
engenders worms that yield a beautiful crimson dye. Many plants, useful in dyeiDg. 
grow wild ; and there are also a number useful in tanning. 

Cattle of every kind are bred in vast numbers on the Steppes, and are increaang whh 
the improvement of agriculture. Beeves are reared as far north as 64 deg., but are most 
abundant in Podolia and the Ukraine. Sheep are raised to a great extent, and the stock 
is said to number 70,000,000 fleeces. The Merino has been naturalized in Little Russia and 
the Baltic provinces. Besides supplying wo<^ for the home manufactures, large qnanti* 
ties have lately been exported. Great attention is also paid to the breed^ of hcnses, 
which thrive upon the Steppes. Shawtwool goats have been introduced ; and besides 
these, there are camels in Taurida and Kh^non ; asses in Taurida ; swine, buflyoeÂ«,etc. 
In the north, the reindeer, so invaluable to the inhabitants of those sterile r^ions, is the 
principal beast of burden. The forests contain vast numbers of wild-bees, which yieW 
abundance of honey and wax for exportation. There are also many wild animals, the 
skins and furs of which constitute important articles of trade in the northern parts of tbe 
empire ; and abundance of others whose flesh -is used for food. 

The agriculture of Russia was, till recently, of ikÂ» rudest kind; but within tiiehst 
few years considerable progress has heea made in improving it. The annual prododioo 
of grain, on an average of five years, has been calculated to amount to 134,81b,920 Eog-

fish qnartors, of whidi thfee-ni&tiiB were reqoiied for tied^ leaving neoriy^ ninety miliioiis 
of qnarters for consumption and exportation. 

Manufactures, â€” Fonneriy Russia imported only manufactured good^, but she now 
inqx>rt8 large quantities of raw materials for the use of her manufactures, and strictly 
prohibits the importation of everything that can compete with them. The distillation of 
corn-brandy, or whiskey, is still the most eictensive and lucrative branch of industry, and 
produces to the Government annually an exciseÂ«duty of ninety millions of roubles ; the 
use of it is universal among the peasantry ; who also consume to a great extent a kind 
of beer called braga. In 1812 the Russian empire numbered 2,332 manufactories, with 
119,093 operatives ; in 1835, 6,045 manufactories, with 279,673 operatives ; in 1839 the 
former had increased to 6,855, and the latter to 412,931 ; and since the manufactures 
have increased to such an extent that they furnish the country with almost sufficient 
supplies, of which only about one-sixth is imported from foreign countries. The van* 
oos articles manufactured in 1843 had a value of seventy-six millions of dollars, while 
those which were imported in the same year, had only the value of thirteen millions. 
The chief manufacturing district is in and around Moscow, where in the just-named 
year cotton mods were manufactured to the value of 15,000,000, and silks to the value 
of 1,000,000 dollars. Of other articles are to be noticed clotii, canvas, cutleries and 
hardware, leather, glassware, eta In 1836, the gold mines did not yield more than 
4^80 lbs. ; and those of pfatina only 174 lbs. The qtmntity of gold, however, obtaii^ 
in the same year, from private mines, was 4,860 lbs., and of platina 4,248 lbs. During 
the ten years, 1834-44, the average quantity of gold produced from the Oural mines, 
and coined, amounted to 40,687 ms., and of platina, 1,557 lbs. In the five years from 
1842 to 1846, the produce of the Oural gold mines has been estimated at $dO,000,000. 
The product has since increased, amountinje in 1851 to twenty millions of dollars. 
The silver mines yield annually about 43,200 lbs., besides 1^40,000 lbs. of lead. The 
^[gregate amount of copper from the government and private mines is 7,596,000 lbs. 
The principal iron mines are situated in Finland. The smelting of the ore is performed 
by eight different furnaces ; and nearly the whole of the iron produced is distributed 
among the forges in different parts of the country, t^inland likewise produces copper. 
Iron of the best quality is also found at Tula, which is a great seat of the iron manu- 
factures of Russia. The salt lake on the Steppes produce immense quantities of salt, to 
the amount, it is said, of 324,580 tons annually. Alum is produced to the yearly 
amount of 576,000 lbs. 

Fishery. â€” A prodigious quantity of fish is supplied by the lakes and rivers ; and of 
these the Volga and the Oka are particularly productive. The principal kinds of fish 
are sturgeon, bielugc^ and salmon, besides carp, pike, and trout. The Black Sea like- 
wise prepuces lampreys and mackerel ; and a laud of herring is found both there and in 
the Sea of Azov, Caviare, the consumption of which is very great in Russia, is made 
from the roes of the sterlet, a variety of the sturgeon, and from those of the bieluga. 
A single sterlet yields from ten to thirty pounds weight, and from a single bieluga, 
there may be taken sometimes as mudi as 120 lbs. The best caviare is prepared 
by the Cossacks of the Oural. The nett annual value of the Russian fisheries 
amounts to more than 7,000,000 doUaxs. The fisheries of the Caspian and its trib- 
utary rivers, are by far the most important. They generally belong to the villages and 
cities in the Government of Astrakhan, but pay a yeariy impost to government The 
most extensive fishery, that of the lemba, extends alouff the shores of the Caspian, from 
the mouth of the Oural to the gulf named Mertvoi-Kultuk, a distance of 345 miles. 
The mode in which the fish are taken is extremely rude and inartificial ; and when 
jaken they are placed on rafts, where they are gutted, and the roes, the back-bone, and 
the sounds or swimming bladders carefully separated. The fish themselves .are then oar^ 
ried to huts, where they are salted ; the roes are placed in a reservoir, to separate the fatty 
matter, after which, being pickled and barrelled, they constitute caviare. Sturgeon being 
a cartilaginous fish, have scarcely any earthy matter in their bones, which are in fact 
rather a highly elastic flexible gristle ; their spines, therefore, being rich in gelatine, are, 
together with the ligaments and capsules, saved, and constitute what is termed fish 
cartilage. Lastly, the sounds are drie^ in the sun and become is^glass. Seals are also 
found in the Caspian, and from 60,000 to 100,000 are taken annually, for the sake of

tlieir skins and blubber. The Mherlee take place every jrear in the following order :- 
first, the spring fishery, at the breaking up of the ice, when the greatest qnanthr of 
oariare is made ; second, the stimmer nsbery, when, 6om the lowness of the riym, Ik 
fiidh are retnming to the sea ; third, the atttamn fisheryv firom September to Novembo, 
when the sturgeon, of all the species, are ascending the rivers, and seeking deep poofa 
in which to spend the winter. BCany of them, however, still remain behind, so im 
they are fished for in winter also, by nets sunk through holes in the ice. Dnring Ife 
season the fishermen proceed several versts firom shore on the ice ; and it fireqneBth 
happens that during their fishing an impetuous wind suddenly blows off shore, ikI 
drives the ice into the deep sea, where they cure inevitably lost, unless the wind chaup 
and drive them back again to land. 

Oommerce. â€” The commerce of Russia is very considerable, and internal traffic b n- 
nually increasing. Nineteen fairs have been established in the principal towns, and 
thirteen in the smaller ones. A great number of bazaars have mewise been erected. 
The great centre of the inland trade is at Nishnei-Novgorod, the annual fair at vUd 

gaoe is perhaps the lai^st in the world, and is attended by traders firom all parte d 
uropean and Asiatic Russia, fi'om Khiva, Bokhara, and Persia, who bring witii thm 
the produce of their own country, and carry home in exchange the produdioDs (^ 
Western Europe and America, llie fair las& during August and September, and is 
generally visited by about 150,000 strangers. The amiual value of the goods actoaST 
sold in 1836, amounted to 24,000,000 dollars. The value of merchanÂ£ze sold at al 
tile fairs in 1836, amounted to 60,000,000 doDars. "With respect to the maritiiM 
oommerce of Russia, the value of the mercJiandize imported and exported in 1S5 
amounted in either case to $40,000,000. In 1843 the imports were of the value of 
86,000,000 dollars, and the exports of the value of 61,000,000. The imports cod- 
sisted of coffee, spices, wines and liquors, fish, salt, tobacco, firuit, raw cotton, cottoa 
twist, indigo, cochineal, madder, logwood, and other dyewoods, drugs, olive-oil, bardwaie 
lead, raw sugar, silk, cotton, silk and worsted goods, cloths, and precious stones; bottbe 
importation of every sort bf hiaQufactured or other produce than can compete with the 
manufkctures or natural produce of Russia, is expressly prohibited. The exports con- 
sisted of wheat, rye, barley, oats, wax, mw hides, tanned leather, flax, hemp, tnnbfr. 
â– poteish, hemp oil, linseed oil, copper, iron, tallow, linseed, wool, bristles, cordage, sail- 
cloth, ravens, ducks, flems, cattle, furs, hair, skins, etc The largest articles of expat 
were tallow, hemp, flfiÂ«, and linseed. The principal seats of the maritime commote 
are, St Petersburg, Cronstadt, Riga, and Kevef, on the Baltic Sea; Archangel and 
Onega, on the White Sea ; Odessa, on the Black Sea. St Petersburg alone engrosje 
about one-half of the whole foreign commerce of the empire. 

Internal Comrnfumcations. â€” The roads throughout Russia are, in general, very 
in some places they are formed with trunks of trees laid across, and in others they are 
mere tracts ; but of late some good roads have been formed, and particularly the great 
road fi'om St Petersburg to Moscow is said to be, without exception, the finest in tie 
worid. It has been macadamized throughout, and lined with trees ; and at the end of 
every seven or eight versts there is a station for a corporal and a party of soldiers, who* 
duty it is to keep it in repair. A magnificent road likewise leads from the capital to 
C)sarskocelo, with marble pyramids to mark the distance in versts, and lighted by neariy 
3,000 lanterns. Railroads have also been formed between St Petersburg and Graislro- 
celo ; and between St. Petersburg and Moscow, with branches to Odessa and ote 
places. But one of the most striking features of <3ie country is the great extent of botk 
natural and artificial communication by water. All the great rivers, lakes, and seas, 
have been connected by canals ; so that there is uninterrupted communication from ftc 
Baltic to the Black Sea, the White Sea, and the Caspian. The inland commcicc is 
much ftu5ilitated by the snows of winter over which deighs travel with great fadlity. 

Inhabttants and Population, â€” Russia, only of late years aggregated into an impffW 
whole, presents more diversity of races and languages than any other country; bnt 4fv 
may all be reduced to the following stocks : 1. the ** Sdavonic,** in which are comprise 
the Russians, the Poles, the Lithuanians, the Lettons, and the Kures ; 2. the Rwitfo 
stock, which comprises the Fins, the Carelians, Bsflionians, etc. These are found on tie

coasts of the Golf of Finland, and throiiglHHit n<Â»rthem Busaia ; 3* the Turkish stocky 
0irhich compriBes the inhabitants of Kasan and Astrakan, the Turkomans of the Can* 
^asua, the Nogais and other Tartars of the Crimea, the Baschkirs, etc., extending over a 
large portion of the south-eastern and southern provinces ; 4. the German stock, com- 
3rising the Germans of Ri^ Bevel, St Petersburg, Mitan, etc., and numerous coloniee 
n Saratov and Taurida. ISesides all these, there are many English, Scotch, Danes, and 
>ther foreigners throughout the country, but chiefly in the commercial towns ; Jews, 
Armenians, Moldavians, Wallachians, Persians, Calmucs, Hindoos, Samoyedes, and 
Laplanders. Of these various races, the Great Bussians, or Muscovites, are the roost 
iumerouS| comprising nearly three-fifths of the population. They are found chiefly in 
Central Russia, round Moscow, where the country is densely peopled, and where their 
lumbers are rapidly increasing. 

There are no certain data for ascertaining the amount of the population, but it may 
ye set down at about 65,000,000, of which S4,500,000 are in European Bussia, exclusive 
>f the Caucasus. Of this number, 35,000,000 may represent the Muscovites ; 6,000,000 
he Little Bussians, Busniaks, and Cossacks ; 6,000,000 the Poles ; 1,000,000 the Servians, 
Bulgarians, etc ; 1,200,000 the Lithuanians ; 500,000 the Lettons ; 300,000 the Kures, 
naking a total of the Sclavonic race of 50,000,000. The Fins and their congeners num- 
>er about 3,000,000 ; the Germans 500,000, and the Turks 1,000,000. The proportion 
>{ males to females is as 28 to 30. The increase of population in Bussia is equal to that 
>f any other portion of Europe. 

Classes. â€” The Bussian nation is divided into three classes, the nobility^ cUizenSy and 
feasatUry. About the same distinction is established in Poland, while in the Baltic provin- 
;es the social condition of the population bears a strong resemblance to that of Germany. 
Chere is an essential distinction between heredUa/ry and personal nobilUy. The number 
^f those who belong to the hereditary nobility in the whole Bussian empire (thus including 
he Polish, Bulgarian, Tartarian and other nobles), was some years ago about 551,000 ; 
vrhile the personal nobility (L e. for life-time only), is conferred upon the higher classes of 
he clergy and citizens, and upon all the civu and military public ofl&cers, provided 
hat they are not already nobles by birth. The nobles^ as well as the commoners, are 
xempted from the poll-tax (land-taxes, excises, and other similar taxes they have to pay), 
^nd cannot be compelled to enter the army, though a great many of them enter it 
olantarily ; yet they are required to enter the pubhc service in some line, if not in the 
nilitary, then in civil 

By the term citizens is to be understood all firee inhabitants of cities and towns, 
rho are engaged in commerce, trade, manufacturing, and other branches of industry. 
L*hey are divided into six classes, styled guilds, and are about 4,500,000 in number. 

The peasantry comprises freeholders (about 700,000), peasaMs of the crown (more 
haa 17,500,000), who at present are to be considered as personally free men, and 
hirdly, bondsmen or serfs, about 21,000,000 in number, and for the most part on 
be estates of the nobility. Thus two-thirds of the population are free men, and the 
mperor, Nicholas, has provided by law for the gradusd emancipation of the remaining 
bird also. 

Serfs, â€” A Bussian proprietor reckons the value of his property, not by its annual in- 
ome, but by the number of male serfs upon it ; but the relation Ih which the agricultural 
erf practically stands to his master, is in most respects that of a small tenant ; the prin- 
ipal diflerence being, that he cannot change his employment or move from home, with- 
ut his master's leave, which is sometimes obtained for a certain annual sum, câ‚¬dled 
brok, in lieu of service. As a general rule, he has a house and a portion of land, for 
r'hich he pays rent in labor instead of money; working three days a week for his 
1 aster, and having the other three at his own disposal. The serfs are grossly igno- 
iTit, and habitually careless and improvident; yet they are contented and happy, and 
t*ar about them no sigqs of oppression ; their desires are few and easily satisfied ; their 
Lfe is coarse and poor, but they seldom suffer from cold or hunger, and they are naturallv 
Liy, good humored, and light-hearted. They cannot legally be sold or transferred to 
nother master, except with the whole of their family. A serf once given to the military 
^rvi(*e is emancipated forever. When his term is out, he does not return into serfdom,

bat bas the chcMoe of poriiioA mnd oooapatkm, witk the oUiga&>n to become inscribed 
in Bome rural or town commonity. His wife becomes emancipated likewise. Childia 
begotten before his entering the military service remain serfs^ those daring it, follow tk 
new condition of the parents. Thus the recruiting becomes an agency of putnl 
emancipation. 

The station of domestic servants is much worse than that of the agricolturists. As Ike 
riches of the Russian noble consist in the labor of his peasants, it is his study to torn thai 
to good account ; the law, besides, requires him to maintain them, and, if they are fomid 
begging, he is liable in a fijie. He is thearefore obliged to keep always a certein niimbcT 
of people, whether they are useful to him or not ; and as every kind of out-d^or labn n 
at a stand during the winter, he naturally turns to the establishment of some sort of 
manufactory as a means of employing them, and as a source of profit to himseE And 
not only are the nobles manufactorers, but they carry on the business in ev^ braocb; 
and their privileges give them great advantages over the other classes who are not al* 
lowed to possess serfs. No people in Europe are so plainly or coarsely fed. Thev dally 
fate a)n8ists of pickled cucumbers, cabbages, and mushrooms, with a piece of Uaek 
bread. Fish and butcher-meat they seldom taste* 

Education^ etc. â€” All the civU schools in the empire are placed und^ the minist^ of 

Ciblic instruction. This class is subdivided into : 1. Parish schools, intended lot tk 
wer orders ; 2. District schools, which have three classes, intended for the chiktren of 
shop-keepers, and restricted in their course of instruction to the catechism, writing, drawing, 
tbe rudiments of grammar, arithmetic, geometry, geography, and history ; 3. Gymna^ 
authorized to embrace higher studies, but accessible only to the children of the nobjlitr; 
aiidy4* Universities, which consist each of three fiaculties â€” philosophy, jurisprudence, aiid 
medicine, of which the courses last five years. The University of Dorpat has also a fa^ 
ultv of theology. The universities are those of St. Petersburg, Moscow, Kharicofi^ Kasao, 
Wkite Russia, and Kief. As a part of the general system, tbe Russian language has 
been substituted for the Polish in all the schools of Poland. Private schook are likewise 
placed under the inspection of the local authorities, and can inake use of no bods bm 
those appointed by Government The establishment of new private schools is prohibit 
at Moscow and St Petersburg, and is allowed iQ other places only to such foreigners as 
shall have resided five years in Russia, and have, by naturalization, become Russian sab- 
}tâ‚¬^ No father has the power of selecting the instructors of his children at his own 
pleasure ; he must take them from among the persons licensed by Government, or for- 
niehed with an authority which gives them the character of public functionaries. Edo- 
cataon in cmy foreign country is positively pohibited to all under 18 years of age ; and 
even after that age, it is only the emperor himself who can grant the necessary permis- 
sion. 

The military schools chiefly engage the solicitude of the Gh>vemment ; and, accordijighr, 
they increase daily, and absorb the greater part of the funds allotted to national educa- 
tion. Nevertheless, there is no army so poor as the Russian in able officers. 

The ecclesiastical schools^ designed chiefly for the education of the d^gy, are divided 
into three circuits, those of St Petersburg, Moscow, and Kief. Each circuit is composed 
of superior schools or acadenues, of intermediate schocds or seminaries, and of lower 
schools in the smaller districts and parishes. They are under the superintendence of the 
Holy Synod. 

The Press. â€” In the whole empire, about 70 newspapers or periodicals are published. 
The press is under a strict censorship, which, in university towns, is entrusted to com- 
mittees, and everywhere else to censors espedally appointed. The censorship of woite 
relating to religion rests with the ecclesiastical bodies. Every book hostile to the creed 
of the Greek Church, to monarchical autocratic authority, to decency, to morality, to pri- 
vate honor, is prohibited; and the first duty of the elisors is "to consider what is the 
object which the author has proposed to himself in writing his work." 

Religion. â€” The orthodox Greek Church is the dominant religion of the empire; bet 
all other religions are not only tolerated, but even freely professed, difierence of erwd 
being no obstacle to the attainment of public employments. The Russians, the Cossacks 
Moldavians, Wallachians, and numerous proselytes among ibe Permiaas, Vognb, Sa* 



EMPIRE OF RUSBIA. m 

moy edes, Laps, and others, belong to the dominant churchy wfaiefa nnmben about 45,000,009 
tneinbers. The Poles, Rusniaks, and Lithuanians, are Roman Catholics, or United Ghreeks ; 
and the total numbers of that creed are about 3,500,000, The Fins, Esthonians, Swedes, 
and most of the German settlers, are Lutherans. Calvinism reckons but a small number 
of Poles and Germans. Islamism is professed by almost the whole of the numerous 
population of the Turkish or Tartar race, and the Arabs. The Jews, of course, follow the 
law of Moses. The Cahnucks are worshippers of the Lama; and many of the Samoyedes 
and other nomadic races are idolaters. 

â€¢ Government-. â€” All poweremanates from the Czar. The title of &moder;ete(autocrator), 
which the czar assumes, indicates the nature of his authority, which he is presumed to 
derive only from -God. He is the central point of the administration. His authority is 
delegated to the great boards or colleges of the empire, which preside over the central 
admiuirftration, and to the governors-general, and oth^ local functionaries. The three 
great boards of administration are, the Cknmcilofthe Empirej the Directing Senate^ and 
the Hofi/ Synod. The first is divided into four departments: those of legislation, of war, of 
civil and religious affairs, and of finances. The ministers and a secretary of the empire 
form part of this board, which has the charge of all important affairs, with the exception of 
those relating to foreign policy. The Directing Senate is considered as the highest council 
of state. The czar himself is its president, and he names the senators, whose number is in- 
definite. This senate superintends the execution of the laws, and the receipt and expen- 
diture of the public money, promulgates the laws and edicts authorized by the czar, ap- 
pointb to public employments, and judges, as the last resort, in all legal causes. In the 
Holfj Synod is vested the supreme authority of the Greco-Russian church. It is composed 
of a certain number of prelates, named by the emperor, who is himself the sole head of 
the church, and presents to all ecclesiastical offices. The executive power is confided to 
ministers and secretaries of state, who form a fourth board, named the CommUUe of 
Ministers^ but which is subordinate to the three great bodies already mentioned. Russia 
is a monarchy, absolute and hereditary ; but ttie various parts of the empire present 
considerable cfifferences in their administration, and some of them are governed according 
to the ancient privileges, which they have preserved, or to the constitution granted to 
them at the period of their union with the empire. Thus the Cossacks of the Don, and 
of the Black Sea, form military republics, under a first magistrate, named their hetnum^ 
who forms the organ of communication with the emperor ; but, by various gradual 
changes, their privileges have been at last almost annihilated, and their territories reduced 
to the condition of ordinary provinces. Finland also forms a grand-duchy, with a con- 
stitution entirely different from that of the other parts of the empire. Livonia, Esthonia, 
and Courland also enjoy considerable privileges ; but still these privileges are held at the 
will of a despot, who may abrogate them whenever he pleases. Poland now forms an 
integral part of the empire ; though it has a separate administration and particular laws, 
which cannot be all at once superseded by those of Russia. 

Revenue and Debt â€” The revenues of the empire arise chiefly from a capitation tax of 
two roubles on each peasant, and five on each burgher ; a tax of If per ct on the capital of 
merchants ; rents of the crown-lands of peasants, customs, stamps, patents, etc, ; the 
monopoly of spirituous liquors and salt ; mines ; purchase of exemption from military 
services; fines on smugglers and other delinquents; the crown fisheries, mills, manufac- 
tures, baths ; the profits of the mints and the post-office ; and the tribute in furs paid by 
the nomadic races. The total income for 1851 amounted to about 55,000,000 dollars ; 
allowance, however, must be made for large sums never carried to the general account, 
but either appropriated to local purposes, or paid in kind by various sections of the popu- 
lation. In some districts, also, the capitation tax is commuted for labor or military ser- 
vice. To the sum above stated may also be added the produce of the gold and platina 
mines. The imperial debt amounts to $300,000,000. There is little gold in circula- 
tion ; the only silver coin is the rouble (76 cents), and its aliquot parts of halves, quar- 
ters, tenths, and twentieths. There is a large copper circulation of opecks, one hundred 
of which are equal to a paper rouble (21 cents) ; indeed, the only trae metallic currency 
may be said to be the copper. 

Army. â€” According to the official reports for 1852, the armed force was in the follow- 



164 EMPIRE OP RUSSIA. 



f, 



ing state. The Corps of Guards, commanded by the Ghrand Duke, the heir to the Em- 
ire, is established in St, Petersburg, and for a distance of 100 miles around that city. 
t consists of three Divisions of infantry and one of reserve, of four Divisions of cavahy, 
a large force of artillery with 120 to 140 cannon, and a special body of field engineere, 
sappers, and a pontoon corps. Next comes the Corps of the Grenadiers. Its head- 
quarters are in the ancient city of Novgorod, some one hundred miles on the road be- 
tween Petersburg and Moscow. Its regiments are established principally in the militaij 
colonies. This Corps has three Divisions of infantry, and one of cavalry ; the park pf 
artillery amounts to between 115 and 120 pieces. After these two separate Corps comes 
what is called the active army. It is composed of six Corps or nearly twenty Divisions 
of infantry, six Divisions of regular cavalry, with an irregular one of Cossacks, etc^ ad- 
joined in time of war, and at least 700 pieces of artillery. Its head-quarters are at War- 
saw. It faces the western frontier of Europe exclusively. It is quartered from the Bal- 
tic, through Lithuania to the Danube, the Black Sea and the frontiers of the military 
cavalry colonies in South Russia. A separate Corps occupies the city of Moscow and 
several surrounding counties. 

The army of the Caucasus is composed of four divisions of infantry, one of regular 
cavalry, numerous irregular Cossacks of various denominations, a body of Mussulmans 
and militia from among the natives. A division of infantry occupies Finland, and an- 
other is scattered in Siberia. This active army is backed by a reserve composed of 25 
brigades of infantry and 270 squadrons of cavalry. 

The guard of tne interior, formed of armed veterans, performing in the cities and 
boroughs the internal service, amounts to 60 battalions which, however, are not fall 
Further, there is a corps of gendarmes, containing 8 brigades, horse and foot, spread 
over the whole empire. The gendarmes fulfil the duties of the police of the army 
during war, and of a political police through the country at all times. 

The irregular cavalry consists principally of Cossacks. There are several denomina- 
tions of them, derived mainly from the regions on the banks of the rivers along which 
they are settled. The Cossacks muster in all 765 squadrons, each containing a few 
more than 100 men, of which more than a third can be mobilized. 

The whole bulk of the armed land force consists of 17 corps, with 4,900 companies of 
infantry, and 1,469 squadrons of cavalry, and 330 batteries of heavy or light artilleTy. 
More than a third of this ought to be deducted as not capable of being moved towards 
the extreme frontiers of the empire, as well as for incomplete numbers in the various 
battalions, companies, and squadrons. The remainder makes up the Russian army, 
which can be moved and directed by the order of a single will according to its whim 
and pleasure. But natural impossibilities oppose and impede the concentration in one 
spot and even in one region of such masses of men and animals. For instance, it is 
impossible to feed them for a prolonged term of time, in either a cultivated or in a 
savage country. 

The Russian navy may be said to be the creation of the present Czar Nicholas. 
Within the last fifteen or twenty years he has established two large fleets in the gulf of 
Finland and the Black Sea. Each squadron has a three decker of 100 to 120 guns, and 
eight smaller two deckers, of from 70 to 90 guns, with six frigates and a very few 
steamers and other smaller vessels, sloops, schooners, etc Three squadrons form the 
fleet of the Baltic, and two that of the Black Sea. Aside from this, there is a small 
flotilla in the Caspian Sea, and a steamer and few other vessels in the lake of UraL In 
the Baltic as well as in the Euxine and the sea of Azoffj there are numerous gun- 
boats. All the vessels are fully manned, but the quality does not correspond with the 
quantity. Russia, not having a commercial Marine, has no great number of sailors, or 
of masters and mates. The latter, in the small number of Russian commercial ves- 
sels, are nearly all foreigners, notwithstanding the existence of a law according to which 
the master of a Russian vessel ought to be a native Russian. But this law is eluded, 
as there is no possibility whatever, of finding such men. The sailors for the navy are 
selected principally from among the people living along the shores of the Baltic, the 
Euxine and the Azofl*, and from among the boatmen on the Wolga and on the Doa. 
Greeks and Armenians may be found among the number. All these put together do

lot fornishy however, a third part of the required nmnber, and the remainder of the crew 
s composed of men who, previous to being enlisted, had never been on water, except 
;>erhaps in a ferry-boat, A great many Jewish conscripts are thus employed. The 
inass of the crews are in a season transformed into sailors by mere driJl and force. The 
/essels of the fleets in the Baltic can scarcely be kept 4 months on the high sea, and the 
Buxine but 4 or 6 weeks longer. This is the whole time which can be devoted to prac- 
ising naval exercises and manoeuvres. The remainder of the year, the crews are garri- 
K)ned in harbors, and trained in the military land exercise. Thus, the greater part of 
he crews are neither real nor skilful sailors or gunners, but form scarcely second-rate 
ufantry. 

The officers are educated from childhood in special nautical establishments, and most 
>f them, at least theoretically, are able and well informed. 

The vessels have no uniformity in their construction. Some are as heavy as old 
Dutch galliots, some are modelled on English and American patterns. The material, 
ivhich is mostly oak, is bad; not that there is no lumber in Russia, but the navy-yards 
i,nd arsenals are under the same principle of venalitv and theft which pervades all other 
tranches of the administration. Thus the vessels last only from 10 to 15 years. In 
general the Russian Navy is to be regarded as a defensive wooden wall, which can never 
36 transformed into an offensive weapon against Europe, or be made to act single- 
landed against any of the maritime powers, with the exception of Sweden, Turkey, and 
iie like smaller ones.

History. â€” Little or nothing is known of Gtermany anterior to about 100 years before 
3ur Christian era. The country was known to the Komans by the name of Germanioj 
and its southern and western parts were conquered by them, especially Rheetia, compris- 
ing in substance the present Tyrol, Vindelicia, South Bavaria and the south-eastern part 
3f the present kingaom of Wirtemberg, and Noricum, arch-duchy of Austria, Styria, 
Carinthia, and part of Carniola. The chief Grerman tribes, mentioned by the Romans, 
tfvere the Cimbrians, whose principal seat was in Jutiand, Teutones in Mecklenburg, 
Chatts, chiefly in Hesse, Cherusks, in the centre of the present kingdom of Hanover 
ind -Lippe-Detmold, and Marcomans, in Bohemia. The ancient Germans were ruled 
3v native princes elected out of illustrious families ; their leaders in time of war were 
jfected from among the most valiant warriors. They had no cities or towns, but lived 
ji rough huts or cottages scattered about, and in only rather few instances united to a 
tillage. Chastity and hospitality were their characteristic virtues. At the period of 
Jie foundation of the Prankish kingdom by Clovis, as mentioned in a former article, the 
most powerful of the German tribes were the following : â€” 1. The Frieslanders, along 
the coast of the North Sea, between the Zuyder Zee and the mouth of the Weser. 
J. The Saxons, occupying the whole tract of land between the Rhine and Eider rivers, 
:hat comprises at present Westphalia, the principalities of Lippe, the middle and south* 
2rn parts of Hanover, Brunswick, and Holstein. 3. The Franks, consisting of Ripua- 
â€¢ian Franks, in the present Rhenish province of Prussia, who, under the reign of their 
iing, Clovis, conquered nearly all Gaul and imparted their name to this country, and 
3f Salic Franks, from whom is derived the name of Franconia, which is still the com- 
non name of the northern half of Bavaria, where they had their principal seat 4. The 
Alemanni, primitively called Suevians, and occupying the whole tract of land, which in 
X later period formed the Swabian circle. 5. The Bajorians, the forefathers of the Ba- 
/arians proper, having their principal seat in the southern half of the present kingdom of 
Bavaria. 6. The Thuringians, living in the countries at present consisting of the 
Saxon grand-duchy and duchies. 

All these tribes were subjected partly by Clovis and his Merovingian successors, partly 
)y Charlemagne, and thus incorporated into the great Frankish empire ; and not before 
he year &43, when this empire was divided, by the treaty of Verdum, did (Germany be-

similar great qualities. In 962 he was crowned in Rome emperor by the pope, and as 
this crample was followed by his successors, the German kings were henceforth com- 
monly styled Roman-German emperors. Otho's next three successors were Otho U. 
(972-983), Otho IIL (9S3-1002), and Henrv IL, (1002-1024), with whom the imperial 
line of the Saxon house became extinct. 

Conrad II. (1024-1039) was now elected, belonging to the ducal house of Franconia, 
or the Salic Franks, for which reason the emperors of this house were frequently called 
the Salic emperors. His son and successor, Henry III. (1039-1056), was the most en- 
ergetic of all the German emperors. Had he lived longer (for he was only 39 years old 
when be died in 1056), the popes would never have dared to meddle, as they did, to the 
greatest prejudice of the political independence of Germany. This was first tried suc- 
cessfully by Pope Gregory VIL diuing the reign of Henry's son, Henry IV. (1056-1106), 
whom he treated in the most humuating manner. With Henry IV.'s son and suc- 
cessor, Henrt V. (1106-1135), the line of the so-called Salic emperors became estinct.

ItOTHARE, (earl of Supplingenburg, in the present dachy of Brunswick), reigned from 
125 to 11^7 ; in wkich period, originated the long-lasting straggle between the Guelphs 
Lnd GrhibellineS) or between the adherents of the house of Saxony fwhich duchy, to- 
gether with that of Bavaria, was under the sway of the Guelphs) and of the house of 
dohenstaufen (under whose sway was the duchy of Swabia). Lothare, whose son-in-law 
^as duke of both Saxony and Bavaria, grossly oifended his rivals ; but after his death 
hese very rivals were elected, first Conrad lit (1137-1152), then his nephew, Frederic 
[., sumamed Barbarossa (1162-1190), and next to him his son Henry Vl. (^1190-1197). 
When the last-named emperor died, his son Frederic was only 3 years old, of which 
iiroumstance the Guelphs availed themselves, to elect (in 1198) one of their adherents, 
3tho (son of Henry, surnamed the Lion, duke of Saxony), while the other party elected 
Henry's younger brother Philip, surnamed of Swabia (1198-1208). But the latter was 
nurdered in 1208, after which, Otho IV. reigned without opposition until the year 
1215, when Henry's son, Frederic II. (1215-1250), was elected. With Frederic's son 
md successor, Conrad IV. (1250-1254), the house of Hohenstaufen became extinct, 
md now, a period of nearly 20 years ensued, which in German history is known by the 
lame of the Great Interregnum, for not only the law of the sword exercised its barbar- 
>ns sway uncontrolled throughout Germany, but the number of petty sovereigns in- 
creased from year to year, so that at the end of the 13th century it amounted already to 
ilmost 150 (duchies, principalities, earidoms, bishoprics, free cities, etc) Some of the 
uterman princes tried to put an end to this anarchy, by electing in succession the eari 
WilUam of Holland (1256), Richard of Cornwall (1272), and King Alphonso of Cat- 
dlie (who never set a foot on the Grerman ground); but these mock-kings had no 
iuthority. Finally, it became evident to all that the continuance of such a state of 
things would lead to common ruin. Even the pope insisted energetically upon the 
election of a new sovereign of all Gtermany; and Rodolph I. ^1273-1291), earl, or 
joxmt of Hapsburg in Switeerland, was elected. He proved himself worthy of the con- 
[idence shown to him, and succeeded in a rather short time to restore tranquillity and 
3rder to the country. Ottokar, king of Bohemia and sovereign of nearly all the other 
3resent German provinces of Austria, refusing to acknowledge Rodolph as emperor, was 
declared outlawed, defeated in two decisive battles, and, with the exception of Bohemia 
md Moravia, deprived of his possession. Carinthia was given in fee to the earl Main- 
^ard of Tyrol ; but Rodolph invested his own sons, Albert and Rodolph, with Austria 
[i. e., the present archduchy of Austria), Styria, and Carniola, and thus laid the founda- 
tion to the domestic power of the house of HAPSBURe in Austria. It was perhaps 
3wing to this somewhat selfish proceeding, that not his eldest son but the earl Adolphus 
d{ Nassau (1291-1298) was next elected king and emperor of Germany. However, 
Rodolph's son did not acquiesce, but took the field against Adolphus, defeated and 
killed him in a battle at Gellheim (in the present Bavarian Palatinate), and was then 
recognized as emperor, by the name of Albert I. (1298-1308). In the period from his 
death (in 1308), until towards the middle of the 15th centurv, princes from different 
tiouses mounted the imperial throne. First, Henry VII. (130o-l313), from the house 
^f Luxemburg; and next to him, Louis IV. (1313-1347), sumamed the Bavarian^ be- 
sause he belonged to the reigning Bavarian house of Wittelsbach. Then one party 
sleeted the Earl Gunther of Schwarzburg, while another party elected Henry VlL*s 
^ndson, Charles of Luxemburg. The latter, or Charles IV. (1347-1378), got the 
better of the other, the easier, as Gunther soon died (in 1349). Charles IV. is re- 
markable as the author of the so-called Golden BuUj i. e., a public document concerning 
the election of the emperor, the rank or dignity of the 7 electors, etc., which was pu(^ 
Lished in 1356. He was succeeded by his eldest son Wenceslaus (1378-1400),, who 
sared so little for the public welfare, that in 1400 four electors chose the Palatine Rupert 
(1400-1410) in his place. Rupert, however, made himself unpopular, likewise ; more- 
over, he had not been generally recognized as emperor ; one party elected the mamrave 
[odocns of Moravia (a cousin of Wenceslaus) ; another, Wenceslaus's brother Bigts- 
mund ; and thus there were at one period 3 German kings, or emperors, at once, for 
Wenceslaus lived until 1419. Finally, Sigismund (1410-1437) maintained himself in 
the possession of the imperial crown. Ihiring his reign, the Council at Constance 



taS OESMANIC CONFEDBBATION.. 

held in 1415, and John Huss was bnmt there, which gave rise to the War of the Hmeilu m 
Bohemia, that lasted from 1419 to 1436. It may be noticed here also, that SigismnadfloU 
the margraviate of Brandenbtog (which he had inherited), together with the eleetofii 
dignity, to the burgrave Frederic of HohenzoUern, at the price of 400,000 ducats. It wm 
this purchase which laid the foundation of the present kingdom of Prussia. SigisDwad 
died in 1437, and was succeeded by his son-in-law Albert IL (1437-1439) of Aoelm; 
and henceforth only princes of this house, with one single exception, were elected empe- 
rors. Albert's successor was his cousin, Frbderic III, (1439-1493), who vnus the fatsu 
elected German king crowned emperor at Rome. His son Maxjmilian L (1493-1519) 
was the first who proclaimed himself << elected Grerman emperor," which sabsequeBtfy 
was the usual title of the sovereigns of the Grerman empire. 

During Maximilian's reign, the Reformaiion began. LuthÂ» published bis ninety^ve 
propositions on the 31st of October, 1517. Most of the public acts of Maximilian's grand- 
son and successor, Charles V. (1519-1556), had reference to the Reformation ; asÂ» liar 
instance, the diets at Worms, in 1521 ; Spire, in 1529 ; Augsburg, in 1530 ; the so-caUed 
Bchmalkaldian war, in 1546 ; the treaty of Passau, in 1552; the treaty of peace, conduded 
at Augsburg in 1555, by which the religious differences were settied ; and the Council at 
Trent, by which the creed of the Roman Catholic church was finally settled. C%ailes 
renounced the Austrian estates, which he had inherited from his grandfather Maxlniiliany 
in favor of his younger brother, Ferdinand I. (1556-1564), who at the same tiaie had 
been elected emperor. Ferdinand was succeeded by his son Maximilian II. (1564â€”1576), 
who, like his father, was noted for his clemency and equity. His son and successor, Ro- 
DOLPH II. (1576-1612), was a very learned scholar, but unfit for ruling, which also may 
be said of his brother Matthias (1612-1619), under whose reign the Thirty Years War 
(1618-1648) originated. It is easy to conceive that an event so important in its coDse- 
quences as the Reformation had proved to be, must produce a violent fermentatioa in 
tiie minds of the majority of Roman Catholics, and at last lead to a reaction and opes 
))ostilities. In the course of time, ihe mutual exasperation between the Catholics and 
Protestants had increased to the hijzhest pitch, and both parties waited, as it were, only 
for a plausible pretext to strike t^e first blow. This pretext was offered by the Protestants 
at Prague, who precipitated the imperial governors from the windows of the royal castle, 
on the 23d of May, 1618. The Bohemians then elected the elector Frederic V. of the Pa* 
latinate their king, but w^e defeated in the battle near Prague, on the 8th of November, 
1620, and the war soon extended to all parts of Germany. Meanwhile, the ooosin ol 
Matthias, Febdinand IL (1619-1637), had been elected emperor, and during his reign 
the principal events of the war took place : the total defeat of king Christian V. of Den- 
mark in the battle of Lutter on the Barenburg, 27th of August, 16^ ; the taking oi Mag* 
deburg by storm, 20th of May, 1631 ; the battle of Breitenfeld, 7th of September, 1631 ; 
the battle of Liitzen, 16th of November, 1632, etc Ferdinand IL was succeeded by his 
son Ferdinand III. (1637-1657), whose reign is noted for the Westphalian Trea^ of 
peace, concluded on the 24th of October, 1648, at Miinster, with reference to the Catho- 
lic concerns, and at Osnabruck with reference to the Protestant conc^ns. By the terms 
of this treaty, which, down to the commencement of the French Revolution, constttnted 
the public law of Europe, and especially of Germany, the executive power of the emperor 
was restricted still more than ever before. Ferdinand IL died in 1657, and was sqo- 
ceeded by his son Leopold L (1657-1705), who was succeeded first by his eldest son 
Joseph L (1705-1711), and then by a younger son Charles VL (1711-1740), with whan 
the male line of the house of Hapsburg became extinct. Charies V L bequeathed all his 
patrimonial dominions (comprising the present Austrian monarchy, with the exception 
of the since-acquired Polish provinces and Venetian territories) to his only daughter, the 
celebrated queen Mary Theresa, who was married to Francis Stephen, duke of Lioiraiae, 
whence the house of Hapsburg has since been styled Hapsburg-Lorraine, Claims opoa 
the Austrian dominions were put in by several German princes, above all by Charles Al- 
bert, elector of Bavaria, and cousin to Mary Theresa. Yet the latt^ prevailed both against 
htm and the other pretenders, with the exception of Frederic IL of Prussia, to whom she 
oeded the greatest part of Silesia. Charles Albert was, however, elected emperor by tke 
jsame of Charles V IL ; but he died in 1745| when Mary Theresa's consort was elected 



. GSEMANIC CONFEDEBATION; 169 

emperor by the name of Francis L (1746--1766). He was succeeded first by his eldest 
Mm Joseph IL (1765-1790)9 and then by a younger son Leopold II. (1790-1792). Leo* 
poid's son, Francis II. (1792-1806), was the last Grerman emperor. The German Emmre 
was officially styled the Holy Roman or the Bjonum^Germcm Empire. The term ^ ao* 
man' had reference to the fact that Charlemagne had been crowned by the Pope as 
SQCcessor to the Roman Emperors, at Rome, a practice continued for many ages, but 
which came to an end, as we have seen, in 1493. The term ' Holy' rested upon the idea 
of the emperor being the protector and defender of the holy see and of all Christendom. 
The States op Empire (Reichstande) consisted of Archbishops, Bishops, Abbots, Pro- 
vosts, Dukes, Margraves, Princes, Lords, and Imperial Cities, who had the independent 
government of their own domains.* Besides these, there were certain territories belonging 
to knights. Imperial Villages, etc. Most of these States formed part of those Ten Circles, 
into which Germany was divided by the emperor Maximilian I., for the purpose of mainÂ« 
taining public peace and order, and executing sentences of the supreme courts of the Em^ 
pire with armed force, in case of necessity. The Circles were organized in a similar man> 
ner as the Empire itself, but had no political power. 

The princes of the empire, after the latter hSedf of the 17th century, were seldom or never 
personally present at the Diet, but were represented there by plenipotentiaries. According 
to the terms of the constiti^tion, the diet was to be convoked at least every tenth year ; 
but firora the year 1663 it was p^manent, and held its sessions at Ratisbon (on the Dan- 
ube and in the present kingdom of Bavaria). The supreme judicial power was vested in 
two imperial tribunals, viz. the Imperial Chamber (Reichskammergericht) at Wetzlax^ 
and the Imperial Aulic Council (Reicbshofrath) in Vienna. 

The Diet consisted of three colleges, viz. 1. the Electors; 2. the Princes, of whom ninety* 
four had each one vote, while thirty-nine prelates and ninety-three counts had collectively 
six votes ; 3. fifty imperial cities, thirteen of the Rhenish and thirty-seven of the Suabian 
branch. Thus the total numb^ of the German States, which collectively made up the 
EUnpire, was not far from 300. But at all times, a few powerful princes overshadowed 
all iiie rest. The right and privilege of electing the emperor was exclusively vested in the 
BLscTORS, i. e., those most powerftd states of the emfÂ»re that had exercised this right 
firom the beginning. Primitively they wÂ«re only 7 in number (viz. the electors of Mentz, 
Treves, Cologne, Bohemia, Palatinate, Saxony, and Brandenburg), but in the 17th cen- 
tury two others (of Bavaria and Brunswiok-Luneburg) were added to them. The prin- 
cipal elector was the archbishop of Mentz. The election of the emperor took place at 
Frankfort on the Maine, where subsequently to the year 1564 the emperor was crowned 
by the archbishop and elector of Mentz. Though the emperor was the nominal sove- 
reign of all Germany, he was in the exercise of his executive power greatly restricted, the 
rmu authority resting with the Diet and the local princes. 

In consequence of the conquests of the French on the left bank of the Rhine, and the 
ti^eaty of Luneville in 1801, the German empire underwent many alterations. The arch- 
bishops of Treves and Cologne were not only deprived of their territories, but al- 
so of their charact^ as actual electors. The elector of Mentz was restricted to his prin- 
cipality of Aschaffenburg on the Maine. All Grerman territories, in fact, on the left bank 
of the Rhine, were to be ceded to France, and in order to indemnify their princes, the 
â€¢overeign bishoprics, etc, were secularized and divided. 

Notwithstanding these alterations, the Grerman empire retained its ancient forms and 
organization, until, in 1806, Napoleon induced the majority of the German princes to 
unite in a confederation, which was styled the Confederation of the Rhine. As by this 
anrangement the G^man empire had actually ceased to exist, the emperor, Francis IL, on 
the 6th of August^ 1806, proclaimed its formal dissolution. 

In 1806 and 1807, Napoleon created the following new states in Gtermany, viz. 1. the 
ffrand-duchy of Berg, which was first given to Murat, Napoleon'3 brother-in-law, and in 
1609 to Napoleon's nephew ; it comprised the ancient duchy of Berg, and several parte 
of Westphalia, and had in 1809 an area of 6,709^ square miles, and a population of 
878,157 inhabitants. 2. The grand-duchy of Wurzburg, which in 1806 was given to the 
former grand-duke of Tuscany, Ferdinand Joseph. It had, in 1808, an area of 1,651 
â€¢qaare miles, and a population of 256,331 inhabitantsi and c6nsisted of the secularized

given to Napoleon's broths Jerome. It bad tben an extent of 14,826 square miles, vith 
1,912,303 inhabitants, and comprised ttie greatest part of Hesie-Oassel and Haoofo, 
Brunswick, and many parts of the present Prussian province of Saxony, and dlstiietof 
Minden. Its capital and royal residence was CasseL 4. The grand-duchy of Frankibrt, 
which comprised, besides the city of this name, the principality of Aschaflenboig aod 
the districts of Hanau and Fnlda, and was in 1809 created in favor of the above-raeo- 
tioned former archbishop and elector of Mentz, Charies Theodore of Dalber^. It had aa 
extent of 1,874 square miles, and a population of 300,000 inhabitants. 

After the political events in 1814 and 1815, these new creations dti^ppeared, and the 
respective territories were restored to their former sovefdgns ; other sovereigns, who antfl 
then had retained their sovereign^, were mediatized,* and, according to the tenor of a 
treaty concluded at Vienna on the oth of Jane, 1816, a union of the several Grerman Stateas 
reduced to thirty-nine in number, was formed by the name of Gbuoanio Ck>NFÂ£i>BRATiox, 
the object of which was to provide for mutual safety and defence. Each State was in- 
dependent within itself; but, for general purposes, the whole were to be governed by the 
Diet, a body composed of plenipotentiaries from the different States, and residiiig at 
Frankfort on the Maine. This Diet acts, according to circumstances, either in a com' 
mittee, or in full session. The Austrian plenipotentiary pre^des. 

In the Committee, Austria, Prussia, Bavaria, Saxony, Hanover, Wurtembnrg, Badea, 
Hesse-Cassel, have one vote; Hesse-Darmstadt and Hesse*Hombnrg, together, one ; Den-

meetings may be adjourned from time to time. When propositions are introdnced which 
the Committee judge of general interest, it has the power of referring them to the FnB 
Assembly (Plenum). The Plenum can act only upon business previously reported and 
matured by the Committee.

pends on Austria and Prussia. 

Since the dissolution of the ancient German , empire, there are no supreme courts fw 
all Gtermany ; but the larger States have their own, while the smaller German States 
have supreme courts in common. Thus the Saxon grand-duchy and duc^es, tog^er 
with the principalities of Reuss, have a supreme court at Jena in common ; the duchies 
and principalities of Anhalt and Sehwarzburg at Zerbst; the grand-duchies of Meekkn- 
burg at Rostock ; Brunswick and the principalities of Lippe and Waldeck at Wolflkn- 

* That is, their territories were annexed to larger neighboring States, nnder whose sovereignty they were 
placed, thongh still retaining a certain authority in local sdfurs. Of the mediatized princes, the most weahhj 
are : Prince Esterhazy, whose State is now subject to Bavaria, and who derives about $900,000 a year horn 
three square miles of territory, and less than 900 people ; the Prince of Thum and Taxis (annexed to Bava- 
ria, Wurtemburg, and Hohenzollem), who has a revenue of $350,000, and the monopoly c^ posfe-rootet ; Ae 
Duke of Aremberg (now subject to BDuiover and Prussia), who has $875,000, elo. ; and others, to the nooBber 
of 99, whose former States, on the aggregate, covered only 7,036 square aules, and contained a popahnioa tÂ£ 
about 980,000 ; and as these princes ttill retain die Tevennet of these Slates, no less a sum than Â£1,130^

>&ttel, and the four Free Cities (Hamburg, etc.) at Lnbeck ; while Liechtenstein appeals 
o the supreme court at Innsprack ; Hesse-Ilombu]^, to that of Darmstadt ; and the 
jrincipalities of HohenzoIIem to that of Stuttgart The strength of the confederal army 
vas, in 1830, fixed at 303,484 men. 

Ever since the establishment of the existing system, it has been a favorite idea with 
he Grermans to consolidate all Germany into one great and powerful State. The agita- 
ions which began in Europe, in 1848, with the expulsion of Louis Phillipe from France, 
ind the temporary establishment of the French Republic, were soon followed, in Grermany, 
)y the meeting of a parliament at Frankfort, having that end in view. But this object 
vas ultimately defeated, no less by the impossibility of reconciling the conflicting claims 
rf Prussia and Austria to the headship of the nation, than by the domineering claims of 
be Germans to authority over their Sclavonic and other conquered neighbors, held in sub- 
iection by Prussia and Austria ; and especially by the violent breach between the more 
iltra and the more conservative sections of the Gterman liberal party. The Frankfort 
>arliament split into factions ; and the king of Prussia, after he had completely bent to 
he first blasts was enabled to recover his authority and a leading influence in aflairs. 
ie wished indeed to be the chief of Germany, but chief in his own way. After the de- 
iine of the influence of the Frankfort parliament, he seemed inclined to take the matter 
nto his own hands. German representatives w'ere summoned to Berlin, where the propo- 
ition was laid before them to establish a federative Gterman Union, with Prussia at its 
lead. This project miscarried, and a confused series of negotiations took place between 
he different Powers, none of which led to any definite and permanent organization, and 
he sole record of which is, that at the close of 1850, there were three German Unions 
xisting upon paper. 

In the meantime Austria had recovered firom the shock ot the Hungarian revolt, and 
hrew herself into the aflairs of Germany with a boldness and audacity which discon- 
erted the more cautious policy of her rival. State after state was detached from the 
Prussian alliance, and Austria found herself strong enough to demand that the old Frank-* 
3rt Diet, which had been supposed to be dead and buried, should be recognized as the 
npreme authority in Germany; and the representatives of a portion of the States con- 
tituted themselves the Diet. Opportunely the Elector of Hesse-Cassel, who had been 
xpelled by his subjects for violating the constitution which he had himself sanctioned, 
emanded the protection of the Diet That body thereupon ordered the Austrian and 
bavarian contingents to march into the Electorate and reinstate the sovereign. Prussia 
ad committed herself in favor of the subjects, and for a moment seemed disposed to re- 
ist with all her force. The national spirit was aroused. Once more the cry for a united 
nd Constitutional Germany was heard. The army was placed on a war footing, and a 
eneral wcur was anticipated, in which the contest between Liberalism and Despotism 
rould be decided. But when the crisis came, the King hesitated and finally yielded. A 
inference was proposed and agreed to between the Austrian and Prussian ministers, in 
rhich it was agreed that the two Powers should undertake, jointiy, the pacification of the 
Electorate, and should send a joint invitation to all the minor German States to hold a 
inference at Dresden, to consiuer what further should be done ; the validity of the so- 
alled existing Diet being studiously kept in abeyance. 

To understand the proceedings which foUowed, it must be borne in mind that the Con- 
'deration was legally composed of only those territories which had formed part of the Old 
rerman Empire. Both Austria and Prussia possessed dominions beyond these limits, but 
ley formed no part of the Confederation. Prussia, with more than 16,000,000 inhabi- 
LDts, brought but 12,000,000 into the Union ; Austria, with nearly 38,000,000, brought 
ss than 12,000,000 ; while the thirty-three minor States brought in about 18,000,000. 
'he majority of these minor States i^ere disposed to favor Prussia rather than Austria ; 
at Bavaria, the third Power of the Confederacy, with a population of 4,500,000, while 
â–ºrming the natural point of union for the smaller States against either Austria or Prus- 
a, was disposed to favor the former of these Powers rather than, the latter, when opposed 
â–º each other. The main question in debate was as to the composition of the executive 
ithority of the proposed new Confederation. At one time it seemed that Aus- 
la and Prussia had agreed in a scheme which would deprive the smaller States of 



173 GERMANIC CONFEDERATION. . 

any effective voice* This was so vehemently opposed that it was abandoned ; and lihit 
the minor States, with the secret concurrence oi Prussia, demanded a complete retimie 
the Constitution of the old Diet. Prussia, however, was unwilling to abandon all tie 
ground she had gained during the two stormy years. By the old Constitation, the ftei 
dency of the Diet was vested in the Austrian rlenipotentiary. Prussia now demaodoi 
the right of sharing that honor. Austria replied by a counter demand that sta^ered hs 
opponent. This was no less than the admission of all her non-German territories hia 
the Union ; thus at once trebling her power, and giving her an undisputed preponderaoce. 
Prussia could hardly object to this with consistency, for she had silently introduced Ikt 
non-German possessions into the body. Though these were small compared with those 
of Austria, the principle was yielded that the Confederacy was not necessarily to be con- 
fined to Crerman States. 

Prussia and the minor States united in opposing this demand. England and France also 
protested against it. They assumed the right to do this, on the ground that all the Pow- 
ers of Europe were parties in the original formation of the Grerman Confederation, ii 
1815 ; and that the balance of power would be disturbed by such an enormous acceasi<n 
to that Confederation. â–  Russia also united in this view, and declared against the project 
of Austria. 

All attempts at a new organization failed ; and at last it was determined, by commoa 
consent, but on the demand of Prussia, that the old Federal Diet, thrown overboard ii 
1848, recognized in 1850 by Austria and her allies, but not by those who took part witb 
Prussia, should be solemnly reinstated on precisely the old grounds. This amounted, it 
effect, to the determination to ignore the entire proceedings of the three eventful yeare 
which had just passed. The Dresden Conference was closed, and the Frankfort Diet was 
opened on the 30th of May, 1851. 

The Diet no sooner met than it found great difficulty in bringing affairs back to the pre- 
cise state which existed previous to 1848. The greater portion of the secondary princes 
had granted Constitutions more or less liberal to their subjects. Reformatory measures 
had been commenced in Prussia. Austria, herself, was nominally a constitutional empire. 
These liberal concessions in the smaller States, were mainly founded upon the declaration 
of fundamental rights (Grundrechte), put forth by the Frankfort Parliament, in Sept l&iS. 
The Diet determined to strike a blow at the whole of these Constitutions, by declaring 
the nullity of these Grundrechte. This it did on the 23d of August, 1851, by a resolution 
which declared them of no binding force ; and called on those States in which any meas^ 
ures had been founded on these (Siindrechte, to abolish them forthwith, in as far as they 
did not accord with the laws and objects of the Confederation. In consequence of this, 
the greater portion of the minor princes proceeded at once to abrogate the liberal Consti- 
tutions which they had previously granted. 

Austria now renewed in the Diet the attempt to introduce her non-Grerman territories 
into the Confederation. The English Cabinet presented a remonstrance against the 
measure, as violating the fundamental laws of Europe, and disturbing the balance of 
power. This claim of the right of foreign interference was met by a declaration of the 
Diet, that ** This attempt against the sovereign power of the Confederation, is rejected 
unanimously, with the exception of two votes." but though Prussia joined in this vote, 
she could not but fear the execution of the designs of Austria ; and at last, on the 3d of 
October, 1851, she proposed to withdraw her own non-Germanic provinces from the Con- 
federation. This was acceded to ; and AusVia seeing the determined attitude of opposition 
taken by the European Powers, gladly embraced this action as a pretext for withdrawing 
her cherished proposition, at least until a more favorable conjuncture oflfera. 

Thus at last the political condition of Germany, so far at least as that condition <lf*- 
pends on written forms, has returned back again to precisely the same point at which it 
stood previous to the agitations of 1848, and indeed to the position of 1815. 

Customs' Union, â€” Yet though disappointed in their aspirations for a political union 
and greater political freedom, the Germans have nevertheless made great advances to- 
wards social union and freedom of internal trade and intercourse. 

Among the numerous disadvantages of the cumbrous organization of the Confederation, 
none were so early and severely felt as its restrictions upon commerce. Each State was 



GERMANIC CONFEDERATION. 173 

ndependent within itself, and each established its own tariff and line of custom-houses, 
â€” each endeavoring to gain a revenue at the expense of the industry of its neighbor. 
Prussia was the first to perceive the disadvantage of this policy, and as early as 1818, 
entered into arrangements for mutual fr6e trade between herself and one or two of the 
leigfaboring States. By this arrangement, duties should be levied only on the common 
Tontier, and the avails be shared between the States in proportion to the population of 
parties. The advantages of this soon became apparent, and State after State joined this 
Customs-Union, until it finally embraced almost the whole Confederation, with the excep- 
ion of Austria. This is the Zollverein or Customs-Union, which now comprehends a 
X)pulation of about 30,000,000. The term for which this treaty was originally concluded 
vas to expire at the close of the year 1853. Besides the Zollverein, yet another union 
lonsists of the kingdom of Hanover and a few petty principalities in its neighborhood, 
lumbering in all something less than 2,000,000 of inhabitants, and known as the Steuer- 
serein or Duties-Union. In September, 1851, Prussia, acting somewhat informally in 
he name of the Zollverein, concluded a treaty with Hanover, by which the two Customs- 
Unions were to be united at the beginning of the year 1854, such modifications being in 
he meanwhile made as should be deemed advisable. 

The objects of this association are : 1. The establishment of a uniform system of 
veights and measures. 2. A uniform coinage. 3. Uniform commercial regulations, as 
Â«gards the intercourse of the States composing the league, with other nations ; a power 
)eing conferred on the Senate, which regulates the affairs of the Union, of making trea- 
ies with foreign Powers, binding upon the whole Confederation. 4. Uniform duties of 
jxport, import, and transit. The frontier States levy the duties agreed upon by the Coun- 
cil of the league, on merchandize coming from abroad, and the receipts are divided among 
ill of them in proportion to their populat;^on. The frontier once passed, there is no fur- 
her interruption from custom-houses. 

The advantages derived from this system promise to be greatly increased by a treaty 
ately entered into between Austria and Prussia, by which a certain freedom and reci- 
)rocity of trade has been established between the countries embraced in the Customs- 
Union and the whple extent of the Austrian empire. 

Railroads. â€” Another great step towards the social union of the Germans is the estab- 
ishment of railroads, by which that country is already traversed in various directions, 
ind connected on the one hand with Belgium and France, and on the other with Poland, 
Russia, and Italy. 

A statistical work published in Germany, and complete to the close of 1852, gives the 
ollowing figures upon the raihroads there. The German league is about five miles* 
I'here were, at the close of the year, and for the most part open to the public : â€” 

In Austria 247 leagues. '

â€¢r a total of 1,432 Grerman leagues or 7,000 miles : 5,700 miles are in running order; 
ho rest are not completed ; 4,Â§50 miles are administered by the various Governments ; 
5,650 by private companies. 

Surface. â€” The southern and central parts of Grermany are traversed by ranges of monn- 
ains in every direction, separated only by narrow valleys, while to the north the eleva- 
ion subsides into a wide sandy plain, little above the sea-leveL The Tjnrol is wholly oc- 
upied by branches of the Alps, presenting many of the peculiarities of Switzerland. To 
lie north of these mountain aistncts,the Danube extends almost across the whole length 
f the country, declining from 2,000 feet elevation at its source, to 630 feet where it en- 
?r3 Hungary. The Hercynian and Bohemian mountains form the northern boundary of 



174 GERMANIC CONFEDERATION. 

the Danubian Valley ; and, though inferior in height to the Alps, form a series of h^ 
valleys and table-lands, which fill up the central portions, and, in their eastern prolong 
tion, form the singular valley of Bohemia, which presents the appearance of having bm 
a lake before it was drained by bursting its mountain barriers. Northw^ard of these the 
country sinks into plains, the length of which extends, without interruption, through Si- 
lesia, Lusatia, Brandenburg, Fomerania, Mechlenburg, Holstein, Hanover, and the love 
part of Westphalia, where it assumes the appearance of a vast heath or morass ; an ap- 
pearance, indeed, which it exhibits in other places. The great rivers â€” the Oder, the Hht 
the Weser, and the Rhine, with their tributaries, drain this extensive region. To tie 
west of the Elbe, scarcely a tree appears, but the level tracts are covered "with heath aad 
juniper. To the east the country is more sandy, and covered with pines, interspersed 
however, with extensive plats of fertile soil. The plain of Saxony, of which L#eipsig is the 
centre, is more elevated, and has a more firuitfiil soil. Middle Germany is much diveT>si- 
fied by picturesque scenery, and abounds with verdant and well wooded valleys, wbki 
are watered by clear streams. The banks of the Meyn, the Funda, and the MozelJe, arr 
remarkable for their varied scenery, and the valley of the Rhine unites the grandeur of a 
fine landscape with the appearance of a highly fertile country. In the elevated plains of 
Bavaria the soil is more cold, but generally productive. In the Austrian territories, t^ 
plains are confined by the Alps ; but are equally fertile, while the valleys are as deep, and 
sometimes as narrow as those of Switzerland. 

Rivers. â€” Within the confederate territory, there are 60 navigable rivers. The Daxum 
rises in the Black Forest, and takes hence a course due east, receiving numerous tributs- 
ries, and passes into Hungary at Presburg, near which place it receives the drainage of 
Moravia through the March. The Drave and Save also rise in southern Gtermany ; and 
the Adige which flows south, has its sources in the Rhetian Alps. The Elbe rises twin 
numerous affluents on the north side of the Bohemian mountains, and drains the vallev 
of Bohemia. After escaping through the Sudetic mountains, it flows over the plains of 
northern Germany to the Ocean. The Weser and its large affluents pursue a simiiaT 
course. The Oder drains the north-east, and reaches the sea in a little stream, 20 ni\k> 
below Stettin. The Rhine, in the west, rises in Switzerland, and on leaving that terrirorr 
shoots in a northern direction, receiving in its course the Meyn and the Moselle, and 
passes into Holland, and ultimately finds the sea through several channels. These are all 
magnificent rivers, and give to the country commercial advantages which it otherwise 
could not enjoy. The minor rivers are too numerous to name, and they are less important. 
The lakes of Germany are all small ; and, except the Lake of Constance, on the bordrr 
of Switzerland, useless. 

Geology. â€” The geology of Germany is extremely varied in its several parts. South 
of the Rhetian Alps the rocks are of primary formation, and form rugged and fantastic 
masses, which at a distance look like castles in ruins. This formation overlies porphyry. 
The Alps of Salzburg, which extend to the Danube, are composed of granitic and primi- 
tive rocks. Their tops are lost in the douds. To the west of the lower course of the En?, 
are found fine marbles and rock-salt ; to the east, mines of silver, lead, iron, and coal 
Upon the right bank of the Danube, the low plains are covered with alluvium and detri- 
tal matter. Upon the adjoining slopes of the Carpathian and Sudetic mountains there 
are isolated basins of coal formation. In Silesia the alluvial plains abound in a black 
clay. The constitution of the Bohemian mountains is essentially different in several re- 
spects ; and small-grained granite, micaceous rocks, slate, schist, and sienite, form the 
Bohmewald. Foreste occupy their tops, and their bases are covered with pools and marshw. 
Some of the mountains are of volcanic origin, and contain fireestone and basalt, sur- 
rounded with limestone full of fossil shells. The porphyries of the Erzegebirge have 
undergone some violent upheaving. Many mineral springs issue from these hflls, all from 
their character indicating igneous action. Near Eger is the Kammerberg, a conical mouD* 
tain covered with lava and scorics. The substructure, however, of the Erzegebirge is 
granitic, and its mineral wealth, particularly on the Saxon side, is of such importance, 
as to have given the chain the name it bears, which means * metaliferous mountain?.' 
In the valley of the Danube extend vast tracts of the epoch of the Paris BcLsin, and laige^ 
deposits of extinct animals are found in the dluvial sous. The granitic rocks of the BlÂ»ck

forest enppott, in some places^ limestone of tfie Ueo^dmrj period ; the spturs which ex- 
Biid to the north are composed of old sandstone ; the slopes that overlook the Rhine are 
orms of soil posterior to the chalk, and the flanks of the whole chain are covered with 
hick forests. 

To the north of the Meyn, the hills are composed of primitive limestone ; to the eaat 
nd west, of volcanic deposits ; which form, on the one side^ the chain of the Vogelberg 
nd Wester-wald, and on the other the basaltic group of EifeL The constitution of the 
ormations now entirely changes ; and, to the north and west, all the plains which de- 
cend to the North Sea are covered with immense beds of sedimentary deposits, or with 
â–ºeds of sand overlying chalk, limestone, gypsum, etc, which mix, at last, along tlie shores 
>f the Baltic, with the sandy and marshy soils of Pomemnia. The great plain has every 
tppearance of having been, at no very distant epoch, covered by the sea ; and, in many 
places, its surface still consists of bare sand. 

The mines of Germany are as various as they are rich in products ; and are wrought 
vith much skill and economy. Precious stones are found in many places ; rock-crystal, 
imethysts, and topazes, are plentiful in Bavaria; chalcedony, agate, petchstein, and 
>orcelain-jasper, in Bohemia; barytes in many parts, and abundance of building-stone 
ind clays everywhere. Fossil coal is found in extensive beds. Gold is procured by 
cashing, â€” though only in small quantities, in Saltzburg in Bohemia, in the Rammels- 
>erg, and in Silesia. Silver and cinnabar are raised in the mines of the Erzegebirge in 
3axony. Iron, copper, tin, lead, calamine, bismuth, cobalt, nickel, titanium, arsenic, and 
ilmost every other mineral, are more or less abundant. In consequence of this abundance, 
nineralogy has become a branch of a liberal education. 

Mineral springs, in every variety, are scattered over Gtermany. The Thermal Springs of 
^x-la-Chapelle, Pyrmont, Carkbad, Baden, etc., on the Rhine, attmct crowds of visitors. 
Those of kchel-Baden, near Vienna, and many more, though less frequented, are in no 
vise inferior. The acidulous springs of Selters, Driburg, and Robitsch ; the bitfer wkters 
)f Seidschutz, Seidlitz, etc ; and the long series of salt springs which follow the base of 
lie northern Alps, attest the richness of the under-strata in metallic deposits. 

Climate. â€” The extent of Grermany, no less than its various elevations, naturally pn>- 
luce great variations in climate. On the northern plains the temperature is not cold, but 
he atodosphere is humid and inconstant. They are exposed to the fogs and the tempests 
from two seas. Central Gennany enjoys a more clear and equable climate. The momi- 
:ains form a barrier against the effects of the oceanic influences ; but the elevation ren- 
lers the air colder than a climate of latitude alone would indicate. The climate, how- 
iver, of this region, is finer than any other in Germany ; and is the most salubrious and 
Lgreeable of any in Europe, The Alpine regions of the south comprise every variety of 
limate, in accordance with elevation and protection. The air is generally raw and cold 
n the exposed elevations, while in the plains and valleys a climate equal to that of the 
inest parts of Italy, is enjoyed. 

Soil â€” The soil of Grermany is generally productive. The plains of the north, indeed, 
iontain much waste land ; but ^dong the rivers there are rich and fertile soils, where the 
nost abundant crops are raised. There is, also, in the mountain country south, much 
>arren land ; but the beautiful valleys and small plains among the hills rival the fertility 
>f the best alluvial soils of the north. In general the soil of the north is heavy, and in the 
;outh light ; the former is best adapted for corn, and the latter for the vine. The best soils 
ire found in the middle districts, between the mountains of the south and the northern 
>lain. In Bohemia, Silesia, Franconia, Saxony, and on the Rhine, the proportion of 
^ood soil is much greater than in the north or south. 

Vegetable Products. â€” Forest trees hold a first rank in the vegetable products of Ger- 
nany, and not only supply the wants of the people, but afford timber for export The 
>ak abounds most in the central regions. The other trees are beech, ash, mountain-ash, 
X)plar, pine, and fir ; and, in sheltered spots, walnut, chestnut, almond, and peach trees 
hrive luxuriantly. The coniferous trees are most common in the sandy plains watered 
>y the Oder and the Elbe ; but we look in vain for the hard pine and the lofty fir of 
^ndinavia. To these forests succeed vast wastes, covered with heath; and the remain- 
ng part of northern Germany consists of extensive meadows. In the little hills, however, 



176 GEEMANIC CONFEDERATION. 

of eastern Holstein, of maritime Mecklenburg, and of B;agen, the v^^etation is diCcRot 

and the oak reappears on a more fimitfol soil. 

In the south, vegetation is governed by the topographical character of tbe cooittiT. 
The beech and maple grow so high as 5,500 feet, and the pinus-umbra still higher. The 
birch is a common tree on the declivities. In Austria, the transition from eternal aov 
to the region of vineyards and olive groves, is remarkably rapid. The culture of the ?iaÂ« 
ceases at the height of 2,000 feet ; that of wheat, at 4,000 ; and, at a greater height, ^ 
country is generally covered with pasturage and coniferous trees. 

Every species of grain is cultivated ; but some localities are preferable for the scvotI 
crops. Wheat and barley are most common in the south ; maize, in Austria ; bockwbeat, 
in the sandy soils of the nmth ; and manna, or ^festuca fluitans," is cultivated oa tbe 
banks of the Oder. The potato is grown extensively in the north, and few countries trc 
so plentifully supplied with excellent roots. The culture of garden vegetables has been 
carried to a great degree of perfection. Hops find a genial sou ; and tobacco (of an iIlf^ 
rior description, however) is largely grown. Madder and dyer's weld are partially cote 
vated. Hemp and lint are staple growths, and furnish material for domestic mam- 
factures. 

Vines were originally planted by the Romans along the river bottoms, where they sdl 
produce wines as highly esteemed as those of any other country. The most vaiaed is tbe 
"Hock," from the vineyards of Hockheim, where the best is made. The next in valnc 
are the wines of the M eyn, and the Danube ; and those of the Tyrol and of the Moselk. 
The Bohemian wines are inferior. The secondary wines are used by the people as i 
common beverage ; and such only as are suitable for preservation are exported. Of oBtc 
oil, neither the quantity nor quaJity is important ; the production being confined to t 
small district in the south. Great quantities of rape seed and linseed oils are expressed; 
and for the more common purposes, the oil of herrings, seals, and other aquatic animak 
is very abundant. 

Domestic Animals. â€” The German heavy horse is well adapted for draught and war- 
like purposes, but is not at all suitable for pleasure. There are various breeds of cattle. 
The handsomest are those of the maritime provinces. The Hungarian and Swiss breeds 
prevail in different parts. The mixture, however, of these, is the best for the dairy. At- 
tempts have long been made to improve the German stock, but with littie success. The 
German sheep is a mixture of the original coarse-woolled race and a breed from the Ar- 
dennes. In part of Illyria they have the sheep of Padua, and the fine-woolled sheep <rf 
Spain have been largely introduced. Groats are common, especially in the hilly States, 
and swine are the most important stock in Bavaria, Hanover, Westphalia, etc. Bee- 
rearing, in Lusatia, is a productive employment The seas which wash the shores are 
prolific in fish, and the domestic fisheries give a living to a great number of the people. 

Origin. â€” The inhabitants of Grermany cure of three essentially different families: tbe 
Deutsch, the Sclavonic, and the Latin. The Deutsch, in several families, inhabit muce 
than four-fifths of the country ; and the Sclavonic, comprising the " Tchekkes" of Bo- 
hemia, the "Slowaques" of Moravia and Silesia, the "Annaques" and other tribes in 
Moravia, the "Polonais" of Silesia, the "Cassoubes" of northern Pomerania^ etc, 
comprise very nearly the other fifth. The Latin family is confined to the Italian {>ortiona 
of the Tyrol, Friuli, and Trieste, and the left bank of the Rhine, and some few other 
places. JBesides all these, there are some 300,000 Jews. 

Languages. â€” The pervading language is the Deutsch, and this is the legal language 
of the country. The High and Low Germans speak languages somewhat different, but 
are very similar in habits, character, and disposition. The Low German, or as it is called, 
the Piatt Deutsch, prevails among the people of Lowct Saxony, Westphalia, Holstein, 
etc. ; but as the church services and education are conducted in High Deutsch, thai 
language is known as well, though not preferred, as their own dialect In the south, 
where High Deutsch alone is spoken, the peasantry use a dialect scarcely more intelli* 
gible to those unaccustomed to its use, than the Low Deutsch. The Sclavonic peo- 
ple are found to the east of the Danube ; they retain their Sclavonic dialects, hut 
with a great mixture of Grerman words. The Sclavonians are inferior in civilization, but 
industrious, and much attached to their homes. 



OHBMANIC CONFEDERATION. 177 

ReSgioik â€” Oftflialieisni, Ltithferism, and Calvinism, are equally the leltgions of Qer* 
aanj, and enjoy, in all the States, perfect freedom of worship. For sevecalyears past, 
lowever, the t<Ho latter have been united under the denomination of the Evangeliodl 
I%urch. About one*half of the population is Ca&oMe, about two-fifths belong to Uit 
Svangelical Chuich, and the remainder is divided by the Calvinists^ Moravians, Men^ 
lonites, Jews, etc 

AgricuUmre. â€” Up to the present date, the greater part of the lands of Germany haiw 
>een held by feudal tenures. The possessors of the soil, of whom in every State the save^ 
eign is by far the greatest, have under them a species of cvÂ»tomary tenants called mb^ 
ects (Unterthaner|, who have the cultivation of the common fields divided into smdl 
>ortions, without live intervention of fences. As soon as the com is removed from the 
ield, the lord has the right of pasture ; and owing to these circumstances it is impossible 
o deviate from an ancient practice, by which the different portions of the common land 
nust be devoted to different kinds of crops at specific periods. The rotation almost unb> 
rersally followed and known as the three-crop culture, consists of a fallow, succeeded by 
wo crops of grain. The fallow, however, generally bears a crop, which is usually either 
lax, peas, or potatoes ; and in consequence of this, the land is never properly cleared ol 
Â¥eeds. To this fallow crop succeeds winter com, either wheat or rye ; in the north, the 
)roportion of the latter to the former.is as four to one, and in many parts, especially in 
Bavaria, ten to one. In the southern States, tiie two kinds of grain axe nearly equally 
cultivated. To the winter-com succeeds barley or oats, as the mnd is better adapted to 
;he one or the other, or as may have been settled between ike anceHon ofihepresfmt lords 
ind Vteir tenamts in remote periods. By this mode of cultivation the earth fields but a 
miall increase. The tenants can keep but little live stock, and therefore make but lit- 
:le manure. The live stock they do keep is usually fed, in winter, on straw, and the 
iddition, recently, of potatoes with a small portion of corn, and what dung they do ppo 
luce is of a very weak quality. These tenants are commonly holders of small portH>ns 
)f land, which in many instances is necessarily divided, at their decease, among all their 
children ; and thus the evil of the cottage-system of small farms is clearly experienced 
Fhe villages are crowded with little proprietors, who have not either the conventional or 
he pecuniary power to improve the soil ; who live in a state inferior to laborers, and who, 
Tom the smallness of their farms, can only obtain subsistence by living on the cheapest 
liet, which of late, as in Ireland, ia principally potatoes. Under this system, the number 
)f husbandmen increases rapidly ; they form soldiers, and when called out by the milit- 
ary conscriptions of their provinces, are placed in a. better situation than when living on 
heir farms. 

The only well-cultivated farms in Gtermany are those kept in hand by the great lords, 
vho, from their large stocks of cattle, make manure sufficient to enrich their soils. OthÂ«- 
?rwise the farms of Germany, although the soil possesses a rare fecundity, are badly 
nanaged, and yield comparatively little â€” not more than five-eighths the crops of Eng- 
and, or half the crops of the western United States. From the poorer classes eating 
lothing but rye or potatoes, and from having three-fourths of its population emplojred in 
imculture, Gfermany is enabled to export com in most years ; but when an unpropitious 
;^son occurs, the distress is dreadful, and is increased by the smallness of the States and 
he difficulty of transit fi'om one to the other, an evil which was lamentably felt in 1817 
ind in 1847. 

The land of Grermany produces little beyond the national consumption, except wines, 
lax, and wool. The quality of the Gterman wines is much inferior to those of France, 
ind the quantity much les!Â«. The annual product is stated at two millions of pipes, of 
00 gallons each ; but a very small part of this finds a foreign market Flax frequently 
orming, as before stated, the fallow crop, is important from the employment it affords, 
luring the long cold nights of winter, to the female members of the peasants' family, and 
rom the trade it creates in fhe export of yam and linen cloth. Wool is generally tbe 
>roperty of the lord ; and its annual dip is frequently the principal revenue derived flMn 
xtensive possessions. This has induced many to pay great attention to improvement 4>f 
he staple ; and much of it, espeeially that from Saxony^ is superior to the merino of Spaio' 
t b within the last twenty years that the extension of the brood of the fine-wooUed sheep 
as taken place. 23 

PART I. 



IfB GBBHANIC CONFEDEBATION. 

McmufaciureSy etc. â€” As a maimfacturing country, Gtennany is pre-emiBent, andcci 
sopply itself with by far the greater part of all the commodities it needs. Every towi, 
of moderate population, has it& woollen, linen, cotton, silk, and iron work-shops. Fev 
of these, however, are conducted on a large scale ; and consequently, that minute drvkioi 
of labor, which is so essential to perfection and cheapness of articles, is entirely wantuf. 
Linens are the most valuable products ; and are made, from the coarse fiabrics of West- 
phalia, which are used for negro-clothing, to the finest shirting and table-linen of Siiesb 
and Saxony. Woollens of all kinds are made, and sufficient for consumption. The cas- 
flimeres and Vigonia cloths of the Prussian provinces of the Rhine, are preferred in ai 
markets. The cotton manufactures have increased ; but not so rapidly as tiiose of otbei 
staples. The most considerable districts for tiiese kinds of goods are : Saxony, the Prus- 
sian povinces of Juliars, Berg, and Cleves ; and along the banks of th^ Ens, in the Ass- 
tdan dominions. The chief silk establishments are in Vienna, at Roveredo in the Tynj, 
at Ccrfogne, and at Berlin. Leather, iron, and steel, and wares prepared from them, an 
made at home. Porcelain and common earthen ware are well made ; but the best comei 
fitom the royal factories of Berlin and Dresden. The glass-ware of Bohemia, though iD> 
fericNr, is that in common use, not only throughout dermany, but in many other parti 
oâ‚¬ the world. Paper is an article very inferior in quality, but it is largely mannfactured 
In the preparation of chemicals, the Germans are excellent. The minor manufactures aie 
too various to indicate. They consist principally of musical, mathematical, surgical, aod 
optical instruments ; with watches ana clocks, wooden toys, and plaited straw, in all c^ 
which a peculiar superiority is discernible. Most of the trades of Germany are fettered bj 
the laws o& the guilds, to which the masters have hitherto been obliged to belong ; aid 
this has acted as an impediment to their arriving at that perfection the genius of tbe 
people \& capable of. These sorts of restraints, however, are not likely to last mock 
Imiger. 

nooks. â€” Besides these branches of industry, we may notice also the immense produce 
6f the press, so important in Saxony, Hanover, Wurtemburg, and Bavaria, where very 
smiU towns rival, in this respect, some of the largest cities in Europe, London and Paris 
excepted. Of these, Leipsic, Munich, Stuttoardt, Gotha, Weimar, Carlsruhe, Freyburg 
Jena, Dresden, Gottingen, Hanover, Cassel, Frankfort on the Maine, Augsburg, and Haoo 
burg are the most distinguished. 

Uommerce. â€” In commerce, Germany is surpassed by Great Britain, France, and Bus- 
sia ; nevertheless, it is carried on to a great extent, especially by Harnbui^, Bremen, and 
Trieste, and next to them, by Altona, Lubeck, Stettin, Stralsund, Rostock, Wismar, Kid, 
and Emden. The chief exports are : grain, timber, wool, linen, hard ware, lead, zioc, 
quicksilver, g^ass, salt, wollen and cotton goods, horses, cattle, and butter (the latter, 
especially, from Holstein and Mecklenburg). The inland trade is very considerable ; and 
the principal cities and towns engaged in it are : Vienna, Leipsic, Cologne, FIberfckl, 
Magdeburg, Berlin, Breslau, Prague, Augsburg, Frankfort on the Maine, Frankfort on 
the Oder, Botzen, Laibach, etc. 

EdnicaUon. â€” The Literary Institutions in Germany are both numerous and celebrated. 
The universities, all on a large scale, and comprising the four faculties x)f theology, juris- 
prudence, medicine, and philosophy (including astronomy, etc.) are so excellentiy arrangU, 
and answer the purpose so well, that they are much resorted to, even from other coun- 
tries. At present, there are twenty-three Universities on this scale in Germany, viz. : â€” 

Five in the German provinces of Austria : at Prague (founded in 1348), Vienna (in 
1365), Olmutz (in 1681), Gratz (in 1486), and Innspruck (in 1672). Five in the Ge^ 
man provinces of Prussia : at Greifewald (founded in 1466), Halle (in 1694), Breskii 
(in 1702), Berlin (In 1810), and Bonn (in 1818). Three in Bavaria : at Wurtzbaig 
(founded in 1403), Erlangen (in 1743), and Munich (in 1826). Two in Baden : at Hei. 
delberg (founded in 1386), ana Freiburg (in 1467). One in Saxony : at Leipsio (founded 
in 140^). One in Mecklenburg: at Eostock (founded in 1419). One in Wurtembeig: 
at Tubingen (founded in (1477). One in Hesse*Cassel : at M^burg (founded in IS^)- 
One in Saxe- Weimar : at Jena (founded in 1667). One in Hesse-Dannstadt: at Gie- 
sen (founded in 1607). One in Holstein : at Kiel (founded in 1666). One in Hiafio?er : 
at Gottingen (founded in 1737). 



GERMANIC CONFEDERATION. 1T9 

Towards the end of last century there were, moreoyer, universities at Erfurt, Witten- 
)erg, Frankfort on the Oder, Helmstadt, Rinteln, Dnisburg, Altdorf, and in eighteen other 
)lace8 ; which, however, since have been abolished, or united with others. 

The Public Libraries are likewise on a large scale ; and while there are about fifty of 
bem which contain more than 25,000 volumes each, there are nearly as many that con- 
ain above 100,000 volumes. Munich Ims the largest, which contains 600,000 volumes, 
md another with 160,000 volumes ; the royal library, at Berlin, numbers 600,000 ; the 
mperial, at Vienna, 350,000 volumes. Besides these, there are public libraries at Dres- 
len with 220,000, Gottingen with 300,000, Hamburg with 200,000, Stuttgart with 
J00,000, Woifenbiittel with 190,000, Prague with 130,000, Weimar with 180,000, 
Darmstadt, Frankfort, Breslau with 200,000 volumes, etc 

Munich, Vienna, Berlin, Dresden, and GWttingen may, in some regard, be considered 
IS central points of sciences and arts, not only with regard to Grermany, but also to other 
countries. Highly distinguished are the Picture Galleries in Dresden, Vienna, Miinchen, 
ind Berlin (that of Dusseldorf is, since the year 1806, removed to Munich) ; the Cabinets 
>f Natural Curiosities in Vienna, Prague, Munich, Berlin, Gottingen, and Hamburg ; 
ind the Observatories in Berlin, Vienna, Gottingen, Munich, Prague, and near Gotha. 

No country can rival Germany in the general diffusion of knowledge; and common* 
jchool education is the more widely extended as parents are forced, by the law, to send 
;heir children to school, or at least to give evidence of having, in a suitable manner, pro* 
^ided for their education. The children of the poor enjoy, of course, the benefits of in* 
jtruction free from expenses. The total number of children, frequenting the common schools 
n Germany, amounts to more than 6,000,000. The common public schools in the king- 
iom of Saxony, for instance, were in 1840 frequented by 303,506 children ; and those of 
Prussia, in 1843, frequented by 2,328,146 children ; and as, in 1840, the total population 
y{ Saxony was 1,709,880, and that of Prussia, in 1843, was 15,471,765 inhabitants, it is 
jnpossible to imagine, with regard to common-school education, a more just ratio be- 
Tween school-chil(&en and adults (inclusive of infants) than this, which is one to five' or 
jLx. About 15,500,000 Prussian dollars are, in Germany, annually bestowed upcb this 
branch of school education ; and the 927 teachers, in the common public schools of Sax* 
)ny, for instance (where, as in other German countries, most of these schools are in the 
Ullages of the peasantry), receive a salary of, respectively, 120, 150, 200, 300, 400, 500, 
>00, and 700 Prussian dollars ; which, there, is equal to as many American dollars. 
But while they thus are placed in a situation more or less firee from cares for sustenance, 
hey are not sulowed to occupy any teachership without having previously been carefully 
nstructed in the so-called School Seminaries, and given evidence of solid knowledge, in 
I rigorous examination. That with these arrangements scarcely any, above six years 
)ld, are to be found throughout Germany, who cannot read, and but very few who can* 
lot write, is not to be wondered at Some years ago there were, among 122,897 men 
)f the standing Prussian army, only two soldiers who could not write, and these were not 
jrermans, but Poles from the province of Posen. The total number of Lycea in Ger* 
nany amounts to nearly 100; of Gymnasia, to more than 400; of so-called Latin Schools, 
o about 800 ; and of School Seminaries, to nearly 1,100.* 



* Univer$ities bare, in Germany, Holland, Sweden, Denmark, etc^ the Bgnifieadon of High-Sohools, where 
U branches of science are taught ; and which, for this porpoee, unite the four fiM^olties of theology, jarispra- 
icnce, medicine, and philosophy (indnding astnmomy and iSbe higher branches of mathematics, history, etc.). 
'^euma and Oymnantpns are those higher schools, where all blanches of preparatory knowledge, necessary 
>r those who frequent the onlTersities, are taaght (fbr instance, the Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, mathematics, 
tc.)* Their poinls are (at least in most of the coontries of continental Europe) not boarders, but /^uent thÂ« 
^y ceums and Gynmasioms only at certain hours of the day, and then go home again. Seminaries hare in En 
ope, almost eveT3rwhere, the signification of Preparatory Schoob for flitnre teachers. Pr<hgymnatium$ ave 
zhools where, beside the elements of knowledge, the LiUin is taught, and which, for thb reason, are as fre* 
nently called Latin schools.

SHPnW OF AU6TIUA. 
XL THE EMPIRE OF AUSTRIA. 



ThÂ« Bridge of Sighi, Vauie*. 

Ej^nt, etc. â€” Of this great empire, aituatÂ«d almost in the centre of Europe, the terri- 
tuFy fonns a very copipact mass, embradog a great diversity of soil and climate, and con- 
taining a heterogeneouB assemblage of tribes and nations, which differ from each other in 
langnage, manners, taws, religion, and degrees of civilization. Its greatest length is 860 
miles, and its greatest breadth, exclusive of Dalmatia, about 492 miles ; ^e area of the 
whole being estimated at 257,368 square miles. The frontier line, which is mostly marked 
by natural boundaries, extends upwards of 4,350 miles, of which less than 80 miles is sea- 
coast. 

Civil Divisions. â€” The Austrian empire comprises six kingdoms, viz. Hnngary, with 
SdavonJa and Croatia; Bohemia, Galicia, and Lombardy and Venice ; the Principality 
of Traiijiylvania ; the Duchy of Styria; the Marerariate of Moravia ; and the County 
of Tyrol. The city of Cracow also forms a portion of the empire, having been seized 
upon by the Emperor, in 1846, with the consent of the protecting powers. For adminis- 
trative purposes, they are arranged, exclusive of Cracow, into 15 great provinces, the 
general statistJcs of which are exhibited in ihe annexed Table: â€”

Surface. â€” It may generally be said that in the western section of the empire, high 
mountains, and in the eastern section leyel plains, prevail ; with the exception, how- 
ever, of a level plain in Lombardy, and mountain-ranges in Transylvania. 

The chief mountain-ranges within the limits of the Austrian empire are: easteft 
branches of the Alps ; the Carpathian Mountains, the Bohmerwald, Erzgebirge, and pait 
of the Sudetic Mountains. 

Rivers. â€” The chief rivers and tributaries are : the Danube (with the Inn, Ens, March, 
Trasen, Waag, Neitra, Gran, Theiss, Leitha, Raab, Drave and Save) ; the Elbe (with 
the Moldau and Eger) ; the Po (with the Adda, Ogiio, Mincio, Tagliamento, Piave and 
Brenta) ; the Adige, and the sources of the Vistula. 

Climate. â€” The countries in the north, including Bohemia, Moravia, Gralicia, etc, have 
a climate resembling that of the north of France ; and the agricultural products are very 
similar. The middle region comprehends Upper and Lower Austria, Hungary, Transyl- 
vania, etc, ; and has a milder climate, and in many parts vines and maize are cultivate 
In Lombardy and Venice, and the Illyrian coast, the winters are short, and the soil pro- 
ductive of the finest of firuits, oil, and wine. It is proper to add, however, that the iimu- 
ence of altitude is nowhere so apparent as in the several regions of the Austrian empire. 
The extensive tracts adjacent to the Carpathians, and the lofty barriers between Bohe- 
mia and Moravia, partake of all the rigor of the north ; while Galicia and the interim of 
Bohemia, though lying north of these, are considerably warmer. The average fall of rain 
is much greater in the mountains than on the plains. In Vienna and the low-lying tracts, 
28 inches are a frequent average ; but in the mountains, the average often amounts to 40 
inches and upwards. More than a third of the productive soil of the empire is said to be 
occupied by forests. 

Soil and Products. â€” The soil is generally very fertile, especially most of the plains ia 
Hungary and Sclavonia. Yet not only the most fertile, but at the same time best culti- 
vated districts of the enapire, are the valley of thj Danube, in the Austrian arch-duchy, 
and the plain along the Fo, in Lombardy and Venice. Bohemia, Moravia, and Gralida, 
are likewise favored with a fertile soil. The extensive heaths of Ketskemet and De- 
breczin in Hungary, are sterile wastes. 

Of the total area above stated, 218,431 square miles are computed to be arable land, 
distributed as follows : 82,090 square miles, appropriated to ffrain ; 3355 square miles 
to vine culture ; 234 square miles to rice culture (irf Lombardy) ; 25,816 square miles, 
consisting of meadows and gardens ; and 27,945 square miles of common pastures; tiie 
remainder being covered with forests, the most extensive in Europe next to those of 
Russia. 

In 1842, the whole empire had an aggregate numb^ of more than 14.000,000 head (rf 



XliratB OF AUSTBIA. iM 

ack cattle (the most vahiable breed is reared intiie diitnMÂ» of the Alps, in the Gterman 
ovinces in general, and in Hungary and Qalicia) ; about 2,800,000 horses (the finest 
'eed, in Hungaiy, Transylvania, and the northern German provinces) ; nearly 34^000 
ales (reared in Lomban^ ajad Venice, and in Daknatia) ; 32,000,000 sheep ^three-fifths 
' them of improved breed) ; and 5,345,000 hogs (especially in Hongary). The produce 
' the silk-worm (for which Lombardy and Venioe, the southern part of Tyrol, Istria, etc, 
e noted) amounted, in 1841, to about 4,000,000 pounds of taw silk. 

Minerals.-^ The mining products, in 1841, had a value of 26,058,802 florins (nuMre 
lan ^9,827,000), and coosisted of: gold (from Transylvania and Hungary proper), silver, 
rom Hungary proper, Bohemia, Transvlvania, etc), quicksilver (2,973 quintals, chiefly 
om the mines of Istria), tin (877 qmntals, from Bohemia), copper (49,157 quintals, 
liefly from Hungary), lead (7^,028 quintals, from Carinthia, Camiola, Hungary, etc*), 
nc (4,0e0 quintals, from Hungary and Tyrol), iron, of every description (2,649,632 quin- 
ds, chiefly from Styria, but also from Illyria, Hungary, Bohemia, etc.), and coal (9,353,939 
uintals, chiefly from Bohemia, but also in Moravia, liower Austria, etc.). Austria abounds 
L salt, of everv description ; and in 1841 the rock-salt mines in Galicia, Transylvania, Hun* 
ary proper. Upper Austria, and Styria, produced 3,031,079 quintals ; the salt-springs (in 
Fpper Austria, Salzburg, Oalida, etc), 2,011,616 quintals ; and in the seaports, 733,942 
uintals of salt were made 

Manufactwres. â€” Manufactures have, in the last and present centuries, received consid- 
rable extension in the Austrian dominions, but are still on a comparatively low footaoff, 
rhen compared with those of England and the United States : being conducted in small 
ictories, the requisite division of labor so necessary to perfection, is altogether wanting. 
^ooDens, linens, hardware, and of late years eottcms, are made in almost every village, 
leaving, and other sedentary work, is performed in the cottages, as formerly among the 
arm-women of New-England. Linens are woven in every province of the empire ; but 
be finest are made in Lower Austria, Moravia, and Bohemia. As to hardware, the mines 
upply an ample stere of material ; the manufacture of which is done partly on the spot, 
.ud partly in the larget towns. Bohemia is remarkable for its glass works. Hides, from 
he vast plains of Hungary and Transylvania, are an article of export. Linen paper is 
Dade extensively, and of very fine quality, in consequence of the cheapness of the raw 
naterial. As a manufacturing nation, Austria has one great advantage â€” the cheapness 
>f labor ; but its obstacles are great, especially as regards the cotton manufacture, in its 
listance from the raw material, which, whether landed at Hamburg or Trieste, must be 
jonveyed by land. The inferiority of the machinery is also great. The general system 
)f roads, however, is very complete ; and since the introduction of railroads, the facilities 
)f trade have been greatly increased. 

Commerce, â€” The following statement of the commerce of Austria, which includes 
raffic by land and sea for a series of years, is derived from official documents : â€”

The Austrian mercantile navy is confined to the Adriatic ports, and is of very modem 
date. It is now, however, very respectable, and the laws for the regulation of the mcr- 
chant service excellent. The greater number of vessels, probably two-thirds, belong to 
Trieste ; the remainder to Venice, Fiume, Ragusa, and the Bocche de Catero. Durinflf 
the year 1841, 25,146 vessels, of 847,000 tons, entered the ports of Austria. In 184^ 
29,094 vessels, of 1,006,000 tons arrived. The duty on goods, imported into Austria^

on the frontier, and is said to amount to at least J6 2,000,000 per annum.

and a number of minor vessels. Venice is the chief naval station. The seamen are 
ehiefly Venetians, Istrians, and Dalmatians : the number on service, in 1839, was 2,326 ; 
besides a regiment of marine artillery of 945 men, and a battalion of marines of 1,276 
men. 

Inhabitants. â€” The inhabitants of the Austrian empire may be arranged under five class^: 
viz. I. Sclavonia/ns^ comprising more than half the whole population, and subdivided 
into several distinct races, as the Tschekkes of Bohemia ; the Slowacks of Moravia and 
Hungary ; the Poles of Galicia ; the Busniaks of Galicia and Hungary ; the Wendes 
of Styria, Carniola, Carinthia, etc IL DetUsch or Germans, who occupy Austria, and 
are -thinly scattered over the whole empire. HL Latins^ in the Italian kingdoms, indud- 
ing also the Wallachians, who form the greater portion in the Bukowine, and are veiy 
numerous in Transylvania, Hungary, and the Mihtary Frontier. IV. Ma^arSy who are 
the dominant races in Hungary and Transylvania. V. Beside the above, there are a great 
number of Jews in the west, and Zinganies or Gipsies, Armenians and Greeks in the 
east The average annual increase of population in the empire is about 1.193 per cent, 
thus appearing to double itself in 51 j years. The populations of the above races may be 
thus stated ; Sclavonians, 18,500 ; Germans, 6,000,000 ; Italians, 5,300,000 ; Wallachi- 
ans, 900,000 ; Magyars, 4,500,000 ; Armenians, Albanians, Gypsies, etc, 150,000 ; aad 
Jews, 667,139. 

Religion. â€” The Roman Catholic is the dominant religion, but the Greek Church pre- 
in the eastern provinces. Calvinism is also professed by many in Hungary and 
Transylvania ; and, in the latter, some Unitarians or Socinians are to be found. Men- 
Donites, Jews, and other sectaries are to be met with throughout the empire. Tbe Bomaa 
Catholics number 25,704,119 ; Greeks, 6,629,300 ; Protestants, 3,^,849 ; Jews, 667,139; 
ldl others, 48,022. Every sort of occupations and official {daces are open to all without 
respect to creed. The emperor is, in aU but the name, head of the church, and Poperj is 
^ery limited in its influence ; and since the virtual suppression of the monasteries, by Jo- 
seph IL, the regular clergy have been subject to the secular. The church servioes are now 
read in the vernacular, except tbe mass* Tbefe arc eleven fioroan Catholic archbishops,

id titolar prebendaries, and 23 college foundations. Transylvania has three titular ab- 
>ots and 160 monasteries and convents, and Gklicia 70 monasteries. The Greek United 
Dhurch has one archbishop and one bishop in GhUicia, and five bishops in Hungary. The 
Armenian Catholic Church has an archbishop at Lemberg. The Ghreek Church has an 
vchbishdp, with ten bishops and sixty deacons. The Lutherans are under ten, and the 
Dalvinists under nine superintendents or bishops; The Unitarians have one superintend- 
Mit for 164 parishes. The great principle which pervades the whole ecclesiastical govem- 
aent of the emfure, is the supremacy of tfae civil power over the persons, the property, 
;he beneficiary appointments, axtd even the spiritixtl functions of the clergy of all denomi* 
lations. Every person promulgating a papal bull, edict, or ordinance, without the previ- 
ms sanction of the erown, is subject to confisoalion of property and imprisonment; and 
lo Austrian subject can be excommunicated by any ecclesiastical authority, or even by 
he Pope himsdf, without the emperor's consent Patronage belongs partly to the crown, 
ind partly to the bishops, corporations, and private individuals. A strict surveillance is 
lad over the conduct ot the ministers ; and in cases of irreclaimable immorality, the of- 
fenders are removed to a kind of monastic penitentiary, and kept on short allowance for 
I given period, or for life. 

Edticatien. â€” The system of jprimary and elementary schools, in all the Austrian States, 
s nearly uniform. In the German portion, the schools are more numerous and efficient 
;han in Hungary and the more remote parts of the empire. In the lowest grade 6f schools, 
â€” the " Volbs-bchulen," instruction is confined to reading, writing, and accounts. Above 
;hese are the ^ Gymnasia,^' or high schools, for the classics and mathematics, ^.nd com* 
mercial academies in the towns ; and " Universities," of which there are nine, viz. : at 
Prague, Vienna, Padua, Pavia, Lemberg, Ghratz, Olmutz, Innspruck, and Pesth. The 
dergy have the general supervision of all schools ; and tiie whole are regulated with a 
new to strict uniformity of system, and to their connection with some one or more of the 
â– eligious professions recognized by the State. At the head of the department is the Hof- 
Studien-Commission, at Vienna â€” aboard of lay commissioners, which is in constant com- 
nunication with the religious consistories ; and which examines and reports on every 
joint connected with instruction, profane or sacred, civil or military, but has no legisla* 
ave power or authority of any kind. The principle of instruction which pervades all the 
jchools, is not of the most beneficent kind : the tendency of the system is to check the 
expansion of the mental powers, by confining the attention of the scholars to a prescribed 
â€¢outine of verbal tuition ; and the result is, that the pupils leave school with a very small 
unount of actual knowledge; but having been imbued with the doctrines and opinions 
xrhich are sanctioned by the government, they are found to be ready instruments in car- 
ying into effect its most obnoxious measures. In spite, however, of the prejudices im- 
)ibea with their early instruction, the Austrians are far from being that bigoted and slavÂ» 
sh race a priori deduction would suggest. 

History and GovernmenL â€” The heterogeneous elements of which the Austrian empire 
s composed, have always tended to lessen its strength and its weight in European affairs. 
There has been, especially of late, a disposition in the various nationalities (which burst 
brfh with great force after the French revolution of 1848) to extend or reassert their an- 
nent liberties, and even their independence of the Austrian crown. To counteract this 
fpirit, the imperial government was induced to make concessions, in the shape of consti- 
utions granted to the empire ; but since the suppression of the Bohemian, Italian, and 
Hungarian revolts, these constitutions have been recalled, and the authority of the em* 
)eror has become more despotic than ever. The policy at present seems to be, to sup- 
)ress all local privileges in those parts of the empire in which traces of them had re- 
nained, and to reduce all ranks, orders, and races to one common level of equal obedi- 
nee and complete subordination. The general result of the recent convulsions appears 
o have been to improve the condition of the serfs, who compose so large a part of the 
Biboring population in all the eastern provinces, while the nobles have suffered a corre-

XIL THE KINGDOM OF PRUSSIA 

Extent. â€” The kingdom of Prussia (in Gterman, Preussen) consists of two distmct ierti' 
torieSj situated about forty miles apart, and separated from each other by Hanorer and 
Hesse- CasseL 

The eastern and largÂ» section extends from the Russian frontier and the Baltic tcv 
wards the centre of G^^nany ; while the western territory extends ftmn the banks of the 
Weser across the Rhine, towards the French frontier. 

For administrative purposes the kingdom is divided into eight provinces, which are 
again divided into twenty-five ^regiemqgsbezirke,'' or govermnents, subdivided into 318 
cucles. The names, extent, eta, of the {nrovinces, are exhibited in the following Table: â€”

Surface and SoiV, â€” The western portion extends along both sides of the Lower Rhine; 
the eastern portion comprises a part of that vast plain which extends from the North 
Sea to the Ural Mountains. There are, however, considerable inequalities in the soil and 
surface. The greater part of the soil is sandy, generally level, and often covered with 
heaths ; and there are many sandy plains, which, on account of the expense it would en- 
tail to bring them into cultivation, must forever*lie profitless to agriculture. East Prus- 
sia abounds with lakes and morasses, and nearly one-fourth of the whole surface of the 
country is still covered by forests. Only certain portions near the rivers and other pecu- 
liar situations, can be considered as fertile, or even tolerable soils. The most productive 
corn land is in the vicinity of Tilsit ; and some other parts of East Prussia, and the 
greater part of Posen, are also productive. The whole central portion of West Prussia, 
along the Vistula, is an excellent corn couniary. Silesia, to the east of the Oder, forms a 
large, slightly undulating plain ; but the western portion is more unequal, and rises, to- 
wards the south-west, into high mountains. It contains also several extensive meadows 
and marshes. In Brandenburg the land is low and sandy, frequentiy inundated, and a 
great many marshes and smalllakes are formed in the neighborhood of the rivers. This 
province is well wooded, and some districts are celebrated for the quantity and quality of 
their grain. Pomerania is mostiy formed of lands gained from the sea, and of alluvial de- 
posits ; a great part is covered with forests and heaths, and it is only the banks of riven 
and lakes that admit of profitable cultivation. In Saxony, Magdeburg, and Thuringia, 
the soil is favorable for all kinds of grain ; and these provinces may be considered as the 
granaries of the kingdom. The western provinces are far less fertile than the eastern part 
of the kingdom. Westphalia has littie productive soil, and the Rhenish districts are only 
tolerably fertile. 



KUTODOM OF PBUB6IA. 18r 

Mher$i Lak^Syond Cbiuifa.â€” ^Tbe men whieh imrthroiigh Prasflk, from the highhuids 
yÂ£ Central Eniope to iht North Sea and Baltic, fonn so many valaable outlets of com* 
â–¡Mfce. The Nictmen, the Vistnla^ and the Oder, the latter of which is whdly within Pnuh 
ua, are the largest and most important The Elbe and the Rhine also pass through Prus^ 
$ia, but debouch from other States. In many parts the rivers have been joined together 
by canals, so as to furnish a more complete means of transportation from place to place, 
ftnd a more direct communication with the ocean. The number of lakes is said to exceed 
L,000 ; but few are more than from 10 to 20 miles in length. These occur chieflv in East 
suid West Prussia, and Brandenburg. Many, however, have been embanked, and the land 
reclaimed. They supply vast quantities of fish. 

Climate. â€” The climate is generally temperate and healthy ; but many natural causes 
except localities from this statement On the borders of tiie Baltic Ihe winters are severe- 
[y cold, and the weather changeable, raw, and foggy* The interior is milder and less va- 
riable. Silesia suffers much from rainy autumns and snowy winters ; and, owing to the 
lense forests cmd elevation of the ground, the southern districts are exposed to long and 
Â»eirere winters. The Westphaliau' and Rhenish provinces partake of the general climate 
yi that part of Germany in which they are situated. Varying but little from the pecu- 
liarities of Germany, indeed. Western Prussia may be said to have the same vegetables 
3iDd animals with other parts of that confederation. 

AgricuUwre. â€” The productive industry of Prussia is generally agricultural. The cul- 
tivation of the soil employs three-fourths of the people ; and, during the last century, the 
iace of the country has been changed from the most barren and unproductive in Europe, 
iito one of the most fertile, producing; all the needed home consumption and a large sur- 
3lu3 for exportation. The state of agriculture, however, is different in the several prov- 
nces ; and, in many sections, farming operations are carried on in a slovenly and unsci- 
entific manner. The principal crops grown are wheat, rye, barley, and oats ; but the quan- 
:ity of rye far exceeds all the others, and is the common food of the people. Peas, beans, 
Lnd budkwheat are also raised ; and, in Brandenburg, a species df food is collected from the 
^ festuca fluitans." The culture of potatoes is increasing yearly, and has become so great 
is to supply nearly the entire food to a very large proportion of the laboring classes. Be- 
sides food, the soil also produces many articles for manufactures and commerce. Flax 
is certainly the most important of these ; it is grown in every district and almost by eve- 
y peasant Silesia, however, is the great flax region, and yields two-thirds of the whole 
;>râ‚¬>duce. Tobacco, madder, woad, safilower, and hops are cultivated on a small scale ; 
ind chicory, a substitute for coffee, is largely cultivated in many districts. Beets, for su- 
3^r, are raised in extensive plats, and have become an important branch of Prussian agri- 
culture. Wine is made chiefly in the Rhenish provinces, and also, in a less measure, in 
Posen, Silesia, and Saxony. The culture of esculent vegetables has been carried to a 
jreat degree of perfection. Silk is not yet become an import product; but the climate 
s not unsuited for the worm, or growth of the mulberry. The most productive branch of 
ural economy, next to corn-growing, is that of breeding and fattening cattle ; but neither 
;he cattle nor the sheep are of the best breeds. The stock of sheep number about 15,000,000 
ieeces. Swine are very numerous, and form the chief animal diet of the peasantry. Of 
he lands of the kingdom, 29,000,000 acres are ploughed ; 300.000 in garden culture ; 
10,000 vineyards ; 15,000,000 meadow and pasture ; and 18,000,T)00 wocmIs, forests, 4nd 
>lantations. The remainder of the country is occupied by lakes, rivers, canals, marshes, 
oads, cities, towns, and sterile tracts, the whole amounting to eleven or twelve millions 
Â»f acres. 

Minerals, 7â€” Iron is found almost everywhere, and rock-salt and salt-springs abound. 
Z?oal is found in Westphalia, Saxony, Silesia, and Brandenburg; but the inferior means 
Â»f transportation possessed by the country retard their working. Odd exists in Silesia, 
Â»at not in such quantities as to render its mining remunerative. Silver is also mined in 
Jilesia and Saxony. The useful and precious stones are abundantly supplied. Ck>pper, 
obalt, calamine, arsenic, alum, vitriol, saltpetre are produced, but in quantities not suf- 
Lcient even for home-consumption. Amber is found in mines in Prussia proper, and is 
Jso thrown up by the sea, upon the coasts, which are strictly watched, and the produce 
urmed by government This material is wrought into a variety of articles, and largely

alum, 31,000 do. ; vitriol, 99,000 dow ; etc amounting to a total value of about 15,000,009 
rix dollars. 

Manufactures. â€” Until lately, the manulacturing industry of Pm^ia w^s confined to 
domestic articles ; but the iniatxiuction of railways and the erection of large factoffe 
have now carried the production be3rond the demand ftnr home consumption, llie M 
pactice of home-weaving is still, however, extensively pursued amon^ the agricnftrnd 
mmilies. Weaving, however, is chiefly confined to four materials, viz. mx, cotton, vod, 
and silk. But, besides what is spun at home, Prussia imports largdy from Gh^at Britaia 
Wool is principally supplied from tiieir own flocks ; and, generally, only the coarse kind? 
are consumed at home, while the fine descriptions are exported, via Hamburg, to Eng- 
land and other countries. Linen is the largest manufacture, â€” much larger than that rf 
woollens, but the latter is being rapidly increased* Silk is, as yet, only a minor roami- 
facture. Knitting by the hand, which is practised by the laboring population as an occa 
sional employment, and among the wealthier dasses as a recreation, continnes to supplj 
a great part of the hosiery required, and at so cheap a rate tiiat no machinery can com- 
pete with it. Prassia, however, though at the ptesAt time only a second rate mannbc- 
taring nation, has talent, material, cheap labor, and sufficient power and means of tran^ 
portation to raise it, under a wise administration, into tiie first ranks, and give to it a 
position with which few nations will be able to compete. 

Berlin is the centre of the iron manufactures, and has become celebrated for orna- 
mental worics in that material. Paper is also largely manufactored, and is famished in 
sufficient quantities for home consumption. LieatheBr is made to the full extent of tbe 
demand, and copper and brass wares for all domestic purposes. Tobacco, snufl", sngar, 
soap, candles, cabinet ware, earthen ware, porcelain, tin goods, and almost every article 
of common use, are manufactured within the kingdom. The establishments for brewing 
and distilling are very numerous. In the large cities the type-founders, printers, engraT- 
ers, musical, optical, and mathematical instrument makers, gold and silver smiths, jewel- 
lers, watch-makers, and other artificers, are as numerous and as skilful as in any of the 
other continental States, 

Commerce. â€” Prassia possesses no seaports but on thd Baltic ; and as none even of 
tiiese are calculated to receive large ships, there is very little trade carried on by Pm^ia 
beyond the limits of Europe. The greater part of the exports is conveyed in foreign bot- 
toms, of which British ships exceed those of all other nations together. The prindpal 
ports are Dantzig, Kdnigsberg, Elbing, Memel, Btralsund, CJolberg, Rugen\^'^d, StoJpe, 
jBarth, Swinemund, and Wolgast 

The commerce by land and by internal navigation is principally with Austrfe and Rns- 
sia. From Austria the Prassians receive salt and wine, and send linen yarn in exchanga 
From Russia they import hemp, coqa, hides, tallow, and other raw produce, and send in 
return both linen and woollen cloths. The Rhenish provinces carry on an extensive trade 
with Belgium, Holland,* and the neighboring German States. The principal articles of 
general export are grain, linen and thread, cloth, zinc, iron work, copper and brass work, 
porcelain, timber, cabinet work, iron-mongery, needles, arms, Prussian blue, tobacco, salt 
meat, and musical and mathematical instruments. The most important imports are gold, 
mercury, tin, sugar, coffee, tea, spices, and other colonial produce ; French and Hunga- 
rian wines, cotton, silk, and leaf tobacco. The principal trading towns are : 5cr/m, whicb 
is the centre of the commerce of the kingdom, and the seat of the great national bank; 
Elberfeld^ the seat of the Rhenish West India Ck>mpany and the principal place of foreign 
trade ; Bresla/u, the entrepdt of the trade of Silesia } and Cologne, of that of the Rhine. 

Boads, etc. â€” The roads throughout Prussia, as in the rest of Gtermany, were formerly 
very little calculated for carriage-tmvelling ; but, of late years, excellent roads have been

nercial and political importance firom being at the head of the Grennan Customs- Union.

nyvrn lands and for^sta; fxotn mii^^s,. s^lt-works,. find the porcelain factory at Berlin ; 
rom the post-office ; from land and personal taxes, licenses, customs, excise, etc The 
otml annual receipts, on an average of ten years, are stated at $50,704,500 Prussian ; 
LXid total annual expenditiiiQB at $Sl,123y600. The public d^t amounts to some 
^165,000,000, which pays and interest of f 6,989,800 annually. jL siiiking-fund is estab- 
Lshed for its redemption. 

Army. â€” The Prussian army consists of: 1. the standing anny ; 2. the first-call of the 
Lftandwehr, or reserve; 3; the second-call of the LaDdÂ¥rehr; and 4 the Landsturm, â€” a 
nilitia or national guard* The effective stiength of the standing army is 150,000 in time 
Â»f peace, and its war oompkment is 337,000. The Landwehr numbers 139340. The ranka 
>f the army are supplied by conscdption and bcdlot, and with few exceptions, all between 
i 8 and 26 are liable to be drawn m military service* The standing army is drawn only 
rom those between 20 and 25 ; but volunteers may enter at 17, and choose the corps in 
iThifib they wiU serve, aikl, od cooditioa of equipping tbomaelves, Â«e exempted iÂ»m 
nore than one year's tecviee. The others do duty with the standing army for thsee 
/^ears ; for two years more thev belong to the reserve, and then pass into the Landwehr. 
AlS, however, only 25,000 or 30,000 recruits are required each year, ihe rest of the men 
>f the requisite age pass at once into the Landwehr, in which they continue until 32 
^eara of age. Thus is formed the first^eall of the Landwehr, and in time of war forma 
f>art of the active army. The secondrcall consists of those between 32 and 39, who have 
furevionsly served. These would garrison the fortresses in case of war. The Landsturm 
comprises all men between 17 and 50, who are liable to be called out to suppress civil 
:H>mmotion, or in defence of the country. The army is divided into nine corps d'armes, 
one of guards, and eight of the line. Thus every Prussian must serve in the line three 
years ; in the first-call of the Landwehr, two ; in the second-call of the Landwehr, until 
39 ; and thence to 50 in tiie Landsturm ; and from the commencement of his manhood 
until his vigor forsake him, he is liable to military service. Promotion to the higheet 
raiik is open to all, and soldiers maimed or severely wounded are supported by the State. 
To the military establishment also belong the institutions tot the education of the chil- 
dren of soldiers, at Stralsund and Annaburg, and the military Orphan Hospital at Pots- 
dam. The -principal fortresses are : Eustrin and Spandan, in Brandenbui^; Glatz, GIo- 
^^au, Schweidnitx, Neisse, Sillerberg, and Kosel, in Silesia ; Gmudenz, Pillau, Thorn, 
Dantzig, with Weischselmunde, in nussia ; Posen^ Colberg, and Stettin, in Pomerania ; 
Magdeburg, Wittenberg, Torgau, and ]E^furt,in Saxony ; *Minden, in Westphalia; We* 
sen, Cologne, Juliers, Saar4ouis, Coblentz, aiul Ehienbreitstein, in the RheBish. provinces. 
The king also furnishes the garrison of Luxemburg in common with the king of Holland ; 
and that of Mentz, with the emperor of Austria. 
Prussia is not a naval power. 

Inhabitants. â€” The Germans form the preponderating race in the kingdom ; but in Si- 
lesia, Posen, and the Prussias, tiie people are of Sclavonic origin, and speak various dia^ 
lects of the Sclavic tongue. In East Prussia there are about 50,000 Lithuanians, who re- 
tain their peculiar language ; and there are some Wendens or Vandals in Pomerania, 
Bast Prussia, and Brandeiu>urg, who also have a distinct language. The Jews are moat 
numerous in Posen, and number altogether about 170,000. By the Census (1849), the

Religion. *â€” All creeds are equal in the eye of the law, though tiie Evangelical may be 
-considered, in some respects, as the religion of the State. The Protestants sure in a tba- 
jority In East Pmssia, Brandenburg, Pomerania, and Saxony ; the Catbolios in West- 
phalia, the Rhenish provinces and Posen ; while Pqpery and Protestantism are Beaity 
equally divided in Silesia and West Prussia. Without taking into account the sn^Mo 
sects and Jews, it may be said that three-fifths of the Prussians are Protestants, and two- 
-fifths Roman Catholics. The Protestant clergy of each {Â»rovince are under a synod, ooid- 
posed of the superintendents, who meet annually to deliberate on the affairs of tkf 
churches. They also superintend the schools, and take especial cognizance of the rel%- 
ious education given in them ; and their decisions, after being approved of by the consis- 
tory of the province, are transmitted to the Minister of the Public Instruction. The So- 
man Catholics are undÂ» the spiritual supervision of two archbishops, and are distribaM 
into nine dioceses and 3,200 parishes. Gnfisen is the metropolitan see of the eaaixn. 
and Cologne of the western province. None of these bishops can be installed without the 
approval of the king. Public pilgrimages out of the kingdom are entirely prohibited, and 
none of greater extent than one day's journey are allowed within it The Mennonites 
are excused from military duty, but in lieu of it are obliged to contribute to the support 
of the military academy at Culm. Jews enjoy equal rights, and are liable to conscri}^ioD 
in the same mode as Christians. 

Edttcation. â€” The system of education in Prussia is the most complete ever estaUished 
It is the model on ^which all other systems are, or ought to be framed ; and, indeed, Prus- 
sia is now quoted as the standard in reference to the degree of education possessed by 
other States. The instruction of all classes is carefully provided for, and ibe law com- 
pels all parents to send their children to school Every parish is bound to have an ele- 
mentary school, and every town to have one burgh school, or more, according to its pop- 
ulation. Above these are gymnasia, synonjrmous with the academies of New York : 
and in these institutions classical learning and mathematics are pursued, preparatory u> 
admission into the universities, of which there are seven, viz. those of Beriin, Bresbo, 
Halle, Bonn, Konigsbure;, Munster, and Greifswald. Normal schods provide proper 
teachers for these seversu grades ; and, in some cases, pecuniary assistance is giveii> to 
poor scholars of good promise. The lower schools are generally supported by the towns 
and villages, or by school associations ; and the gymnasia and the other similar estab- 
lishments from the general funds of the Stete or the Province in which they are sitaated 
The Normal Schools are partly supported by the State and partly by the departmental 
funds for schools. The universities are either endowed and have funds of their own, or 
their expenses are borne by the general fund of the nation. A Minister of Public Instruc- 
tion supmntends the whole. This minister is assisted by a numerous council, which is 
divided into three sections : one for church affiadrs ; one for general education ; and a 
third for medicine â€” all the members receiving salaries from the Stete. In each province 
there is a consistory formed on the same model, whose duty it is to superintend, diree^, 
the gymnasia and higher burgh schools. The parish or minor town-schools are undar the 
charge of the magistrates and curates of the respective parishes, assisted by committees. 
There is, moreover, in the chief town of every Circle an inspector, whose authority is con- 
fined within the Circle, and who corresponds with the local inspectors and committees. 
In the regency of every department there is a special councillor for the primary schools, 
the ^' Schulratn," who forms the connecting link between the public instruction and the 
ordinary civil administration of the province, inspecte the schools, quickens and keeps

alive the teal of the lodal inspecton, oonuhitteeii, and teftchens, and cbndacts the conre- 
spondence relative to schools, in the name of the regency, with Hke local and superior in* 
Bpectors, the provincial consistories, and the Minister of Public Instraction. 

GovemtnenL â€” Until very recentty the government was an unlimited monarchy, vested 
mB a king. In 1846, however, the king promulgated a species of a constitution, and the 
Â£rst constitutional Diet was inaugurated at Berlin, 11th April, 1847 ; but this was sudr 
denly dissolved on the 26th June, its proceedings having infringed on the prerogatives 
the king was anxious to reserve to himself. The revolutionary struggle which com- 
menced in Italy, swept over France, and agitated with its doctrines every State of Eu* 
Tope, compelled the long again to call together his parliament ; but the same difficulties 
beset their deliberations, and it was dissolved a second time ; not, however, without the 
deputies protestinff against the arbitrary proceedings of his majesty, and other demon- 
strations of I an independent spirit. At the present time the bayonet keeps peace ; and 
the people, except in determination to repel at a suitable time the aggressions of the king, 
may be said to be under as absolute a monarchy as that which existed previous to the 
con^tution. 



XIII. MINOR STATES OF EUROPE. 

1. The Scandinavian Peninsula includes the two kingdoms of Norway and Sweden, 
united under the same king, but each having a legislature and administration of its own. 
Throughout the whole length of the peninsi3a, which embmces an area of about 300,000 
square miles, a line of lofty and rugged mountains, hills, and table-lands extends, forming 
the watershed between the Atlantic and the Baltic. The crest of these mountains forms 
the boundary between Sweden and Norway. North of 63 deg. N. latitude, they form 
one ridge, rising abruptly on the west, and, as they proceed northward, gradually ap* 
proaching the ocean. South of 63 deg. they form a table-land, having its eastern and 
western declivities deeply furrowed with valleys ; and, from nearly the same point, va- 
rious ridges branch off to the east and south, endosing seveml large lakes. These moun<>^ 
tains, in some parts, reach 8,000 feet in height At no place are they at a greater disr 
tance than 100 miles from the western coast On the eastern side they descend in long 
slopes, interrupted by small level plains, and intersected occasionally by ranges of hills. 
The general elevation of the country varies from 300 to 2,000 feet The most southerly 
portion of Sweden, however, is actually low and flat 

Coarse sand or gravel, but partially covered with a thin layer of fertile soil, forms in 
general the champaign country. A large portion is covered with lakes, morasses, rivers, 
and with inconceivable numbers of boulder-stone or isolated rocks of every size. In some 
parts, the vaUeys are noted for their luxuriant fertility; but even in these much of the 
soil is thin, and obstructed by rocky knots rising above the surface. 

The very small proportion of arable land produces articles of the same kind and qual- 
ity as those of Britain. In the south, grapes and mulberries come to perfection ; while 
in the north, not even grain is cultivated, and but few potatoes are grown. Above the 
snow-line, some lichens alone sustain a feeble existence, and after these vegetation ceases. 
At Stockholm, where the climate is comparatively moderate, the thermometer sinks to 28 
deg. below zero, and a hundred miles frirther north the mercury freezes in the tube. But 
the pure bracing cold of winter invigorates the active powers of life, and is found, at least 
by the natives, far less irksome than the moist piercing blasts of more southern regions. 
The atmosphere is generally pure, and the ravages of contagious diseases are never expe- 
rienced ; while the short but bright summer brings com to maturity in six or eight weeks. 
The mean annual quantity of rain is 17J inches. In Norway the climate is more tem- 
perate than in Sweden, owing to the influence of the sea-winds. 

Next to agriculture, the mines and forests constitute the chief source of wealth. Iron 
is scattered in lavish abundance throughout the country, and nine-tenths of the surface is 
covered with wood. 

The principal manufacture is that of spirits, to which the inhabitants are inordinately 
addicted.

Botb the Swedes and Norwegiami^ Hiotgli apeakiiMr diflfei^iit languages, belong tolle 
Qetmamc tribe, with the exeeption of about 7fi00 Finlajiders and 9,1(K) Liajnandcgi 
Jews are not allowed to dwell in Norway ; while in Sweden they are not permitted to 
â€¢ettle elsewhere than in the cities of Sixickbolnii Gbttenborg, and Norrkoping. In point d 
reU^on, the established church in Sweden and Norway is the Lutheran, arranged oi 
ainular principles as the church of England. In Sweden are 13 bishops (incladuig tbi 
ardibishop of Upsala, and 2,400 pariraes ; and in Norway, 5 bishops and 342 parubes. 

There are 3 universities, viz. two in Sweiden (at Upsala and at Liuid) and one in N(x^ 
way (at Christiania^. Beside these, there are 18 gymnasiums (fourteen in Sweden, and 
four in Norway), 23 seminaries, 148 secondary and 2,9M primary schools. Only few of 
tbepeaBantry are unable to read. 

The government is a limited moaarchv, both in Sweden and Norway. Â£acb king&m 
has its particular constitution, its own laws, aod a national legislature ; and yet, with 
r^rence to the executive power, both are under the control of the same sovereign. Swe- 
den has no public debt ; while that of Norway is quite trifiing. 

The regular army consists, in Sweden, of nearly 40,000, and in Norway of 12,000 men; 
and can, in time of war, be reinforced by 80,000 men of militia and troops of reserve. 

The Swedish navy consists of 10 ships of the line, 14 frigates and sloops of war, 10 
brigs, seveml steamers, and more iiiau 300 gun-boats. 

The inhabitants are inclined to a sea-faring life, and furnish numerous sailors to Eng- 
lish and American ships. Population of the two fcingdoms, 4,650,000*; of whom 3,300,000 
belong to Sweden. 

2. Denmark. -^ This kingdom includes, besides the duchies of Hblstein and Sleswid, 
which form a part of Germany, the peninsula of Jutland and the adjacent islands, with 
Iceland and the Feroe Islands ; in all, 53,000 square miles, with a population of 2,300,0001 
It also has some settlements on the coast of Greenland. The army consists of 25,000 
men ; the navy, of 7 ships of the line, 8 frigates, and several smaller vesseb. 

3. Holland seems once to have be^i an extended swamp, the few inhabitants of which 
lived on the sandy elevations, and fared on the produce of the waters. The period when 
they began to protect themselves by dykes is not known ; but for centuries they have 
successfully combated the waves of the sea, and the result has been a present safety and 
high state of cultivation to this amphibious territory. A great part of Holland is firom 30 
to 40 feet below the water-mark of the coast, and at various times the sea has burst its 
barriers, and on these occasions the most disastrous effects have been produced. In con- 
nection with the building of dykes, ibe draining of the country naturally presents itself ; 
and consequently we find HoUand intersected in every direction with canals and sluices, 
which answer the double means of draining and internal communication, and being lined 
with rows of trees, tend to beautify a most flat and uninteresting conntsry* 

Along the coast there is a line of sand-hills or downs, in some places so high as to sfaat 
out the view of the sea from the tops of the tallest spires. These appear to be formed by 
a natural process, which is still going on, and which is owing to the action of the winds 
on the dry sands, which are borne, in clouds of dust, for more than a mile inland. These 
downs, except at the mouths of rivers, form a sufficient barrier ; and it is only to sudi 
excepted places that the attention of the Dutch is principally directed. There the dykÂ» 
or bulwarks of earth have been constructed, and are carefully kept in repair. Aaross the 
country, in all directions, low mounds have been raised to enclose sections of land or fields 
called "polders,'' which are surrounded and intersected by ditches, into which the water 
runs, and from which it is drawn off by pumps worked by windniills, and carried aJong 
the tops of tiie dykes to the main canals, which intersect the country on a level with 
the sea. 

Holland, as might naturally be supposed, has, in consequence of its superabundance 
of water and its unsheltered exposure to the sea-breeze, a very humid cUmate and a fog- 
gv atmosphere. This is more the case in summer tnaa winter, the latter season bdng 
cteared of its vapor by the prevailing east winds and frosty atmosphere. Notwithstand- 
ing this excessive moisture, the health of the people does not materially suffer ; but theie 
are certain diseases specially attribotabld to the peculiar atmospheeic condition of the 
country. 



MINOR STATES OP EtJROPR 193 

Rural industry is chiefly directed to the breeding and rearing of cattle ; and vast pas- 
tures, of the richest verdures, furnish abundant and wholsome nourishment to thousands 
of animals. In the north, wheat, flax, and madder are raised ; and in the south, where 
agriculture has made the greatest progress, tobacco. Of the total surface, more than two- 
thirds is under cultivation : about 125,000 acres are covered with cities, roads, etc. ; 
250,000 acres by canals, rivers, etc. ; and 1,935,000 by heaths, sea-shore, downs, peat- 
bogs, etc. 

InhabttatUs. â€” Holland contains two distinct people : the Hollanders or Dutch, and the 
Prisons who occupy Priesland and its islands. A few Walloons inhabit Limburg and 
some other places. 

Religion and JSdueation* â€” Perfect freedom of worship is allowed. The majority are Cal- 
vinists. The Lutherans^are next in numbers ; the Mennonites and Remonstrants are also 
numerous; but all these sects, taken in the aggregate, do not amount to one-half the num 
ber of Calvinists. The clergy of iaill sects are maintained by government ; and the expens* 
es of the universities of Ley den, Utrecht, and Groningen, are also defrayed by the State. 
These are resorted to by all sects, indiscriminately, whose theological studies are provided 
for, under professors of their own faith. 

The Dutch system of education is excellent. The institution and regulation of primary 
schools was commenced under the Batavian republic, in 1804, but it was not until 1814 
that it was in full effect. The great object in view is to educate every child in the sim- 
pler branches of general knowledge. General and local inspectors and boards of man- 
agement superintend the whole, and no. teacher is allowed to exercise his profession until 
properly examined as to his competency. The better class of schools are conducted by 
teachers, at their own risks. The law does not compel parents to send their children to 
school, but the poor are not allowed any relief from the public funds unless they do send 
them to the " Armen," or poor-schools ; and the result is, that there are none without edu- 
cation. Secular and religious education are entirely separated, the first being entrusted 
solely to the clergy. 

The government is a constitutional nrionarchy. The king shares the legislative power 
with the " States General," which are divided into two chambers :. the fiyst consisting of 
from 40 to 60 members, nominated for life, by the king ; the second, of 116 deputies, 
elected, by the people of the provinces, for three years. . These take the titie of " Hoghen 
Moghen," or High and Mighty Lords, and are assembled once a year at least Each 
province has its own " States," composed of members belonging to three orders, viz. the 
nobility, citizens, and the country population. The provincial States assemble once a 
year at least, or as often as convoked by the king. The government of the colonies is 
vested exclusively in the king. 

Revenue and Debt. â€” The revenue is derived principally from a land-tax, excise duties, 
and customs. In amount it varies little from $28,000,000. The public debt amounts to 
about $500,000,000, and the yearly interest to about $18,000,000, or more than half the 
total revenue. 

The army, in time of peace, consists of about 40,000 men. The navy consists of 7 
ships of the line, with 65 frigates and sloops of war, and a number of smaller vessels, 
mounting altogether, 2,274 guns. The number of vessels in commission in 1848 were 48, 
carrying 302 guns, and building and in ordinary 86, or in all, 134. The merchant-marine 
consists of 1,528 ships, and 241,676 tons. 

Holland is not a manufacturing country. Some linens are made, however, as also 
-woollen and cotton articles, but chiefly for domestic consumption. Tapes and other 
smaller wares are made at Haarlaem, and bleaching done to some extent. Sugar-refining 
is exclusively carried on in Amsterdam. Gin, of favorite brands, is made at Schneidam 
and other places, and the breweries are also large and numerous. Ship and boat building 
seems to be, at the present time, the chief branch of manufacturing industry. 

Ckrmmerce. â€” The principal imports consist of grain, salt, wines, timber, lean cattle for 
fattening, millinery, and iron and other raw materials of manufacture. The exports are 
agricultural and dairy produce, salted provisions, spices and other East- India staples, 
madder, tobacco, flowers (bulbs), oil, gin, seeds, hiaes, borax, and camphor.

4. Belgium. â€” The borders of Belgium, on the side of Prance, are ru^ed and rather 
mountainous, being traversed by a continuation of the Ardennes, and other ridges oeco- 
pying the northern districts of that country. To the north, however, the sorfiaoe is km, 
scarcely, if at all, raised above the sea, and is intersected in every direction by numeRmg 
rivers and canals, diversified by woods, araUe lands, and meadows, and thickly studded 
with towns and villages. As in Holland, the country along the estuaries and rivers is pro- 
jected from inundation by dykes, and along the open sea by sandhills or downs, vaiying 
m breadth from one to three miles, and in elevation from 50 to 60 feet Hie navigation of 
the sea is rendered intricate by sandy accumulations, and for latge ships even dangacfo^ 

With respect to agriculture, the industry of the Flemings has, witiiin two huadKd 
years, converted a tmct of land, originally a sandy and barren heath, into a rich and beaa* 
tiful garden ; and the crops of wheat and of oats are considerably larger than in the best 
cultivated parts of England. Nine-elevenths of the soil are under actoal cultivatiim, aad 
about twice liie quantity of corn required for home consumption is annually produced. 
The cultivators are in tolerably easy circumstances, and this fkRudshii^ state of agncd- 
ture operates favorably upon manmiacturing industry, every branch of which is ia fall 
activity. Flax, raised principally in Flanders, Bmbant, and Hainault, is one of the ptis* 
cipal products, and brings a high price in foreign markets, on account of ite ezoMent 
quality. Flanders produces this staple to the value of iSl,600/)00 annually. Tbt fioen 
of Flanders is also held in high esteem. Beet-root sugar ia extensively produced. 

The coal mines of Hainault alone produce more tbsm tiiose oi the whole of Fmoe

In reference to its sise, Belgium is one of the. most important manufstctujins; States 
of Europe. Tbe laoes of Brassels and Mechlin, the cloths of Brabant, Flanders, and

mur and loege, the steam-engines of Seraing, are all well known to the commercial 
world. Tbe minor manufactures are also extensive ; and, together with the above, occupy 
at least one-fifth of the male population. Tbe shipping of Belgium is trifling, but her 
commerce is considerable, the intercourse with Oeimany being facilitated by an excel- 
lent system of railroada* 

The majority of the people, known as Flemings, belong to the great Germanic tribe, 
and differ but little from the I>utch, in language, customs, and manners. The people in

sp>eak dialects of the French language. The following Table will exhibit the extent and

About nineteen-twentieths of the Belgians are Boman Catholics, and the church of 
Rome is established by law. The clergy are verv numerous and influential, and, as a 
general thing, the people are ignorant, bigoted, ana superstitious. All other rdigions are 
tolerated, yet there are not 25,(K)0 Protestants in the whole kingdom. The church is under 
the jurisdiction of the archbishop of Malines and the five bishops of Bruges, Ghent, Liege, 
Namur, and Toumay. The archbishop's salary is about $20,000 per annum, and those 
of the bishops vary from $11,000 to f 15,000. The cures, or parish priests are divided 
into three classes : of the first class there are 81 ; of the second, 165 ; and of the inferi(Hr 
(deiffyi 4,422, whose salaries vary from $40 to $150 per annum. All salaries are paid out 
of the public treasury. 

By the Belgic constitution, education ceased to be compulsory ; and the government has 
no control over it, except as re^[ards the few schools paid by the State ; tiie rest is left to 
iodividual enterprise, or the caprice of the communes. At least one-third of the rising 
gen^ation are absolutely without any regular instruction. << Athenees,'' or colleges, are 
eetablished in all the large towns. Besides these there are other colleges for general educa^ 
tion, nnd^ the exclusive management of the clergy. The Jesuits have establishments of this 
kind at Brussels, Namur, Alost, and Ghent These institutions are intended to compete 
witii the ^ Athenees,^ and are conducted with more marked religious bias. They are, 
however, distinct from the Theological Seminaries established in each diocese for the 
education of the priestiiood. Two universities are supported by the State, at Liege and 
Qbent ; one was founded by the dergy at Louvain, and is supported by the diurch.

power, however, is very limited. The leflBlatnre is composed of a Senate and a Chun- 
bea^ of Deputies : one deputy to 45,000. The Senators are elected for eight years and the 
deputies for four years, by citizens paying direct tax. One half the deputies is renewed 
every two, and half the senators every four years. The chambers aaaemble annually on 
the second Friday in November; but tbe king has the right to convoke, adjoam, or dis- 
solve them at wiU; and in case of dissolution, a new election of the whole is required 
The executive is vested in tbe king, assisted by six responsible ministers. The king's 
pay is fixed at 9500,000, besides the use of the royal palaces. The judicial system is 
modelled after that of France. 

The public revenue is about $35,000,000 annually. Abotit ^,000,000 are expended 
in mying interest on the national debt, which amounts to about (150,000,000. 

The army is composed of about 90,000 elTective men. 

S. Spanish Peninsula. â€” This peninsula forms a remaikably compact geographical 
â€¢ection, lying at the south-western extremity of Europe, with the continent of which ittt 
connected by an isthmus, S30 miles broad. The superfirial area is computed at 310,9dO 
square miles ;* of which 176,480 belong to Spain, and 34,800 to Portugal. 

The interior may be considered as one vast table-land, Ijaversed by namerbos monn- 
taina and intersected by a succession of fertile valleys, from 1,800 to 3,600 feet above the 
ocean. Along the coast extends a narrow belt of maritime lowland, rising gradually from 
the margin of the sea, and broken by alternations of bill and dale, which produce a most 
agreeable variety of aspect, and ^Â»esent a pleasing oonliast to the bleak and barren same- 
ness by which the central region is characterized, traversed by long and lofty ranges of 
mountains, having plains of vast extent between them. 



MINOB STATSe OF EUBOPB. 197 

Spain, two centuriee ago the leading State of Bnrope, has long been in a state of de- 
cay, but seems now to be somewhat reviving. 

There has been no census of the Spanish population since 1788. The census of that 
year gave a total of 10^00,000. The population may be now estimated at about 13,000,000 
Of this total, according to government returns, there are 1,898,283 able to read, and 
1,221,000 who can also write. The state of educational means, at the close of 1851, ex- 
hibits a great increase since 1832. It includes 10 Universities, 10 Normal Schools of the 
first class, 23 Elementary Normal Schools supported by the State, 17,009 Boys' Schools 
with 626,882 scholars, 5,021 Girb' Schools with 201,200 scholars, 287 Infant Schools 
with 10,000 scholars ; total scholars, 838,082. The system of teaching is a close model- 
copy of French methods; indeed, most of the recent organizations, of all sorts, have been 
borrowed from that quarter. 

The military force of Spain is the first object of care to the government It is said to 
be in fine order, and complete in all its arms. The force is : . 

Annual Cost. 

Infanby 79,670 ' : $4,180,000 

Cavalry 12,000 '. 870,000 

Artillery 10,000 850,000 

The navy, in 1851, consisted of 3 ships of the line, 5 frigates, 6 corvettes, 13 brigs, 22 
steamboats, and a few small craft, manned by 4,000 sailors, 1650 marines, and 385 steam 
engineers, at an annual. cost of $4,200,000. The list of ships in 1843 was 24; in 1845| 
42; in 1851, 64. 

The commerce and industry of the nation are visibly improving. Of the latter, the 
chief seat . is Catalonia. Asturia comes next. Then Malaga, Seville, and Cadiz. But 
of manufactured articles, Spain does not produce one-third of what she consumes. 

Spanish Law has, of late, been greatiy improved. The Mercantile code was completed 
in 1829; the Criminal, in 1848 ; the Civil, in 1851 ; all copied firom fhe French codes. 

The Roman Ca,thoUc is the established church; yet . all other denominations are, at 

I)resent, not only tolerated, but enjoy almost the same political privileges as the Catho* 
ics. In 1830, the Catholic clergy of Spain numbered 8 archbishops (the archbishop of 
Toledo ranks foremost as primate), 77 bishops, 2,393 csyfions, 1,869 prebendaries, 16,481 
curates, 4,929 vicars, 17,411 beneficiaries, 27,757 seculars in orders, 15,015 sacristans, 
and 3,927 servitors. In the beginning of the year 1835,. there were still 1,940 monaste- 
ries with 30,906 monks. But in the same year, 884 of these cloisters were abolished. The 
number of nunneries now flourishing and prosperous in Spain, is 2,386, and the desire to 
enter them is prevailing to a singular extent among the young Spanish, women. Since 
the recent Concordat, 76 of these cloisters have been established in the diocese of Seville 
alone, containing an aggregate of 3,163 nuns, who devote themselves to the life of teach- 
ers, or to benevolent objects. , Previous to the present Constitution, the number of nun- 
neries was 6,310. . ' 

In the period from, the year 1580 to 1640, when the immense Spanish dominions on 
the American continent and the Portuguese colonies were united, the total extent of the 
Spanish possessions amounted to 9,239,855 square miles. 

Even yet the Spanish Colonies include an area of 110,760 square miles, with about 
4,600,000 inhabitants. 

1. In Africa : the so-called Presidios, or four fortified towns on the northern coast of 
AMca, opposite the province of Granada (Ceuta, Penon de Velez, Alhucemas, and Melilla) ; 
and two islands in the Gulf of Guinea. 

2. In America : the rich islands of Cuba and Porto Rico. 

3. In Asia : the greatest part of the Philippine Islands. â–  

4. In Polynesia: the Ladrone or Marianne Islands. 

Portugal, also, though distracted by civil war, and of little weight in the scale of Eu* 
ropean affairs, still retains some remnants of its former colonial dependencies. 

The foreign possessions of Portugal consist of : 1. the Azores ; 2. Madeira and Porto 
Santo ; 3. the Cape de Verde Islands, on the western coast of Africa ; 4. Angola, Mo- 
sambico, and other territories in Southern Africa ; and 5. Goa, Diu, and other settie- 
ments in the East Indiesb

6. Switzerland. â€” Surfhoe* BwiizeAnnd is a ireiy high tatd itigged conntrj, abotf 
17,000 square miles in extent, traversed by ramifications from tiie Alps and Jura moa> 
tains. The centre of the Alpine Bj&tetn is Monat Si Gk)tlta]t}. From this point tws 
ranges are given off to the sotttk-west, fbmHng the valley of tbe VaUais, watered by tk 
Upper Rhone. Another range extends eastwai^ through the Grisons, and foms tk 
watershed between the Upper Rhine and tke Swiss amuents of the Po. From IImk 
main ranges branches diverge, coveting about two-thirds of ilie ooontry, and fomiiDg na* 
merous vallies, drained by an equal number of mountain torrents, all of which are nhi- 
mately precipitated either into the Rhine, the Rhone, the Po, or the Danube. The chaii 
of the Jura is entirely separated from the Alps by the Lake of Gteneva, the valley of tk 
Rhone, and a long, narrow plain, which stretehes eastward for nearly 180 miles, betweet 
the lakes of Constance and Geneva, but separated from both by ranges of hills and hi^ 
lands. The width of this plain nowhere exceeds 20 miles, and its elevation varies ha^ 
1,200 to 1,350 feet above the sea-leveL 

The immense masses of these mountain regions exhibit a p^ect chaos, and pres^ 
on all sides, inaccessible rocks and everlasting snows. The intervening valUes, howevet 
contain extensive districts, fertile and beautiful, and forming a singular contrast with tk 
mountains that overshadow, and seem ready to overwhelm them. The gradations of aÂ» 
mal and vegetable life are singulariy marked at different elevations ; and liie vine, the oaL 
the beech, the fir, mpidly succeed each other until, from the limits of perpetual soaw. 
animal and vegetable life becomes gradually more and more dwarfish, and at lengtii pvo 
way beneath the blight of inhospitable regions which penetrate the skiea. The hi^ 
Alps commence at 6,500 feet elevation, and the reign of winter is h&e petpetaaL i: 
6,000 feet is the region of glaciers, formed exclusively in tiie high^t valleys, where Urn 
sun never penetrates. Prom Mount Blanc to the frontier of th^ Tyrol, 400 facias an 
counted, varving in size from 3 to 18 or 20 miles in length, and from a half to two and a 
half miles wide, and from 100 to 600 feet thick. Altogeth^, the glaciers of Swiizedaad 
Qompose a sea of ice more than 1,000 square miles in extent ; and it is from these inex- 
haustible sources that the jmndpal rivers of Europe are supplied with water. 

Grovemment â€” Before 1798, Switzerland formed a confederation composed of tfam 
very distinct parts : thirteen canions ; the subjects and vassals of these caotoiis ; and ibss 
iLQies. The thirteen cantons formed fifteen republics, of which eight w^e democratic, fam 
aristocratic, and thre^ oligarchical. The subjects and vassak of the thirteen cantons wen 
possessed in common by the several cantons; the allies were countries aaeodatd 
With the Confederation and under its protection. In 180S, Switseiland waa formed into 
a confederation of 19 cantons ; which, on the downfall of NatK>l6on, was supfdanted br 
the present federal system. By the federal acts of 5th Augnst, 1815, twenty-two cantooi 
were confederated for the mutual protection of their liberty and independence. The Diet 
which directs the general affairs of the country, is composed of deputies from the cantoa% 
who give their votes under instruction, each canton having one vote. In this legisktat 
is vested the power of making treaties ; but the separate cantons may treat with foreign 
powers in military matters, and for purposes of economy and police ; but these treafiei 
must respect the federal pact and the rights of other cantons. The Diet appoints and 
recalls diplomatic agents, oversees the general safety, and regulates the miilitary afiJn 
of the federal army. When the Diet is not sitting, the direction of affairs is vested in thi 
cantons of Zurich, Bern, and Lucerne, each reteining the ri^ht for two years by tuias, 
commencing 15th January, 1815. The internal affairs of each sepamte canton are maa- 
aged by independent local governments, much in the same way as in the United Statea 

The federal revenue is entirely distinct from that of the respective cantons, and is set 
apart to defray the general expenses, and for the maintenance of the confederate arraj 
and public instruction. This revenue is derived from interest accruing from certain caps- 
tals set aside for the purpose. For extraordinary expenses, eaeh canton furnishes a cod* 
tingent proportioned to its means. The sum total has been fixed, since 1818, at 539^271 
Swiss francs, or about (149,000. 

No standing army is maintained, but there are troops in the pay of the several ca n trm a 
^ach canton, however, must have its contingent to the federal army always ready to 
march. The number of men, fixed by law, is 33,758, besides the gsn^al staff; and aa

, The inhabitants of Switzerland belong to two prindpal stocke : the Gexmanic aad 
the Latin. The former comprises the Grermaa Swiss, who inhabit Zurich, Lucerne, Uri, 
Schweiz, Unterwalden, Glanis, Zng, A^penzell, St. Qall, Thargau, Scbauffhaneea, and 
Aar^n ; the greater part of Benie and Basle ; a coosiderable part of Solenre, Fribourg^ 
and Valais ; some commanes of Vand, and the communes of Bosso ia the canton of 
Tessin. They form about seven-tenths of the total population. The LaUn stock com- 
prises the French, t^ Bomen, and the Italian Swiss. The French occupy Neufchatel, 
Geneva, and Vaud, pert of Soleure, Fribourg, and Valsls, and the Jura-portion of Baale 
Â«Dd Berne. They form about one-fifth of tiie whcde. The Bomans or Bhcetians are 
found only in the Orisons, in the Oberland, and in the Engadine. They speak a language 
which they call the Ladin, and which is more near the Latin than either the French ot 
Italian ; and seem to be a distinct people, supposed to have originally emigrated &om 
the Rbcetian Hills. The Italians inhabit Tessin, seme valleys of the Grisons, and some 
places in Valais. The German is the language used in the general afiairs of the Con> 
lederatjon, and in those of all the cantons except Tessio, Vaud, Neufchatel, and Genev^ 
The Swiss-German, however, contains no less than 35 dialects, while the French has 15, 
and the Italian and Roman each 3 dialects ; so that> there are no fewer than M distinct 
dialects spoken in diSerent parts of Switzerland. 

The Swiss are divided between Protestantism and Popery ; and, as a general remark, 
it may be stated, that neaihr all the Germans profess the Protestant, and the French, 
Italians, and Bomans the Roman Catholic religion. The relative numbers are about 
1,300,000 Protestants, and 850,000 Catholics. There are, besides, Bome Anabaptists, and 
about 2,000 Jews. The latter enjoy no poUtical rights. This mixture of races and re- 
Ij^ons proves aiiything but a source of harmony among the Swiss. The Catholics are 
bigoted, and the Protestants retaliate. Tfelther allows the other to becomfe citizens of their 
respective cantons. In some of the cantons Catholicitm is peremptory, and all children 
mast be brought up to that fiiith. There are foor Roman Catholic dioceses : Chur and 
St Gall, BasTe, Lausanne, and Sion ; the bishopt of which are suflragans of the arch* 
bishop of Milan. The Catholic clergy number about â‚¬,000, and are much more oome- 
rous than the Protestant The Protestant church ia ftesbytoian in " 
ment is considered a branch of the department of pubHo instnicti( 
longs to the magistrates of the different cantons. Several disturl 
between the rival churches, and much blood flowed on both sides, 
was the result ; but the Protestants prevailed, and expelled the Jes 
orders from the Confednation. The Protestants even are divided, a 
to Rationalists and Orthodox, a division which has greatly influenc 

7. Italy. â€” Italy, within the last five years, has been the scene of a 
gle for political freedom. The unfortunate cmdition is which she 
Tividly portrayed in the following extracts from a recent letter : â€” 

" The modern troubles of Italy bAgan when Endand and the allied Powers of 1815 
restored the princes and priests, which had so long degraded the people before Napoleon's 
army crossed the Alps. The restoration of the ^urbons and the Honae of Savoy, was 
a restoration of a system of rule which brought about the great movement of 1848. 
The revolution of 1848 was no partial movement, it was tiie up-heaving of a whole 
people ; it required, therefcwe, nnusual efibrts and a large phyBical force to put it down, 
to which France has contributed some 15,000 men, now in Rome ; Switzerland, 12,000, 
now in the kingdom of the Two Sicilies ; Austria 20,000, now in Tuscany and the Roman 
States. With such fweign aid, the government of Italy, from the frontiers of Piedmont 
to the island of Sicily, have carried on, up to the present day, a systematic persecution 
of the liberals â€” those who, in 1848, were in any way conspicuous for then: support of 
Constitutional government 

" Hundreds of men have been sent, chained, to the galleys for life, where they are 
slowly dying. Hundreds more are in prison, not eren knowing their oJfence, while thoo- 
sands have fled their native land and are now in England and America. The amonntof

with no consolation at present, excepting having fought aadei that baDoer of Iibenr 
which has claimed so many victims in all ages. 

" The beat information gives at least 100,000 Italians imprisoned for what are calM 
"political oifences," since 1848; while about 150,000 have fled the country. The tmm. 
bers now actually in prison may be about 30,000. This is a frightful state of thin^i, 
when it is remembered that their only offence is an endeavor to support that form of go^ 
ernment to which their sovereigns swore, before God and man ! 

" In Piedmont, the young king, Victor Emanuel, holds by his Canstitotiooal oath. 
Unlike the other sovereigns of Italy, he can walk about without spies and soldios to 
gnard him. A wise and moderate Parliament is working to improve the social conditkn 
of the people, and framing such laws as the age deman<^. Kailroads wi]l ere long tbiead 
Sardinia in every direction. The commerce of the ports has nearly doubled since 184a. 
The Press is free, and the literature of the country is no longer confined to the stopd 
fables of miraculous imposture ; but a useful and educating class of works are elevating 
t^e condition of the masses, and enabling them to avail themselves of the science of tbe dw. 
" The grand-duke of l^ticany, afraid of his life, ia thinking about abdicating. The Â»â–  
sources of the country are absorbed to pay an Austrian army, which occupies the coik- 
try but does not mix with the people. Criminal Courts are employed in trying politica) 
onenders, and violating justice in every way. An army of spies are the pest of societr: 
you find them in the cafe and the drawing-room ; in the church and the theatre. Afei 
are imprisoned for reading the Bible. There is a press at work, but all under the revision 
of the poUce, who again are responsible to the Jesoits. Trade languishes ; discontei! 
and poverty meet you on all sides. 

" At Rome we have Papacy â€” the cnn* 
of every country where it ia allowed cipj 
power â€” supported by French bayoneO. 
The priests, instead of looking after nieii't 
souls, are trying to govern a conntiy ; at 
if we were living in the days of the Bor- 
gias. The Inquisition has opened its gain 
in 1853, and French soldiers are on goanl 
at the door I Scarcely a week passes wiib- 
out arrests ; and conspiracies grow bke 
fungi, on the rottenness of papal mie. 
Austrian soldiers occupy some parts of the 
Roman States, while Liouis Napoleone 
imperialists play the^anear in the Eternal 
City. The Romans want to get rid of the 
temporal power of the Pope, and all En- 
rope says No! It has been proved thit 
cardinals and bishops make bad states- 
men. PrayingtothcMadonnaalone,won't 
improve the finances of a coontry, nor 
cause roads and ports to build themselves. 
Unfortunately, "miracles" are alvrays con- 
fined to some very useless productions. A 
winking virgin or a sweating statue may 
improve the finances of a particular chnich, 
but neither will improve the condition of 
the people. The Romans know this as 
well as we do â€” they hdve suffered and do

shook it off, and it took four armies â€” 
those of France, Austria, Spain, and Naples â€” to impose this curse once more on the de-

papacy in Borne as at the present moment In fact the whole Italian reTolution is ne* 
ugioos as well as political, and out of sach will grow, assuredly, a second ^eat Reforma- 
tion. The church is trying hard to arrest this event; but what you see of life about it, is 
more like the convulsions caused by a galvanic battery on a dead body, than real vitality. 
We must now pass on to the kingdom of the Two Sicilies. The king has shown him- 
self one of the most cruel and vindictive sovereigns of Italy. He was the first to gmnt 
bis people a Constitutional Charter in 1848, and the first to repudiate it. He joined the 
wax of independence only to betmy Charles Albert : he called together a Parliament to 
deceive the people. As soon as he was able, he imprisoned thousands of his subjects for 
[>olitical opinion, and to this day is doing the same by the aid of a Swiss army. No 
Italian State has suffered more than Naples and Sicily. The king has dedicated a large 
private fortune to soldiers and spies. He has now not less than 120,000 men under arms ; 
1 larger standing force than that of Great Britain. Under such circumstances, he is a 
trainable ally of Austria and a great moral support to the smaller Italian despots. Â£eing 
% rich country, the finances of Naples are in a much better state than those of Rome and 
Tuscany ; but trade and commerce are not improving ; and rebellion, like the fire of Ve- 
suvius, burns under the apparently-tranquil surface. Here, too, the police are always Ut 
work, even to compelling people to shave in a particular way, or not to W(^r a certain 
>hapecl hat. There is no Press but that of the police; and Neapolitans dare not read 
foreign journals. Education is entirely in the hands of the Jesuits, who dictate the books 
from which youth is to be instructed. The masses are amused continually by church 
feasts and miracles. Those who do not attend church are reported to the police. 

" The whole country is depopulated of the leading men of the liberal professions; and 
law-courts and public business generally is carried on by the most wretched members of 
jociety, who have obtained their places by denouncing honest men. The king lives 
mostly at Graeta, a fortress of considerable strength many miles from Naples. When he 
x>mes to the capital, he is generally surrounded by cavalry, and a cloud of police skir- 
nLshers are sent out on all sides. 

" It will be seen, then, that Italy, with the exception of Piedmont, can have no respect 
!br her rulers ; and that the existing government and the existing system of governing can- 
lot last long. When the Italians next rise, they will get rid of the Pope as a temporal 
>rince ; and suggest his sojourn at Jerusalem, which, after all, would be the proper place 
or his Holiness. Never again will the people trust the present generation of sovereigns* 

8. Greece. â€” The kingdom of Greece, estimated to contain 20,000 square miles, 
embraces the following natural divisions : â€” 

Hellas, or Greece Proper â€” a long tract of hilly country, extending about 185 miles 
rora east to west, with a breadth nowhere exceeding 50 miles, between Thessaly and 
lUbania, and the gulfs of Lepanto and Egina; the Morea, the ancient Peloponnesus, a 
)enin8ula 137 miles in length by 135 in its greatest breadth, but of very irregular form, 
ind connected with the mainland of Hellas by the isthmus of Corinth ; the following 
[slauds, chiefly in the Archipelago, viz. Hydra, Spezzia, Poros, Egina, Augistra, Salamis, 
Scopelos, Helidromia, Sciathos, Scyros, Syra, Tinos, Miconos, Cea, Thermia, Naxos, 
.^aros and Antiparos, Siphnos, Seriphos, Cimolos, Milo, Polycandros, Sicinos, los, Amor- 
^os, Santorin, Anaphe, AstypaloBa, and Euboea or Negropont 

The continental portion of Greece is characterized by a very singular distribution of its 
aoun tains, which are so disposed as to enclose large basins or circular hollows. The 
ountry is thus marked out into distinct districts, well adapted to become small commu- 
lities, such as we find the States of ancient Greece to have been. Some of these basins 
erminate at the coast, and seem to have been formed by the retiring of the sea, as those 
f Athens, Argos, Laconia, Messenia, and Elis. Others are completely surrounded by 
heir mountain mmparts, except at one point, where the accumulated waters of the ba- 
ins have forced for themselves an outlet : such are those of BoBotia and Arcadia. Central 
lellas is a rugged district, being occupied almost entirely by the branches and declivities 
f mounts CEta, Helicon, and Parnassus. East and south of this are BoBotia and Attica, 
(ceotia is entirely enclosed by highlands, and is divided centrally by a low range of hills. 
'he lake of Topolias, which occupies the bottom of the larger division, receives all the 
raters of the district, which it sends off by subterraneous passages to the sea, on the

(or the beauty and serenity of its dimate. Western Hellas has a physical character tff 
ferent from that of the eastern portion : it consists of long valleys opening to the soofli, 
and rising towards the mountains of the north. 

The Morea consists of an elevated central plateau or valley, and of five separate man. 
time regions, formed by the exterior declivities of the mountains, and divided by tbs 
spurs or branches. The central valley of Arcadia, so famed in pastoral poetry, is hiffb aoj 
cold, often covered with fogs, and subject to malaria. Most of its waters are earned off 
by the single channel of the river Roufia ; but it has sometimes sufSsred from partial in- 
undations. The coast regions are genially well watered and fertile ; partly broken bj 
rugged hills, but usually level. They are distinguished by the names of Argolis, wfaica 
stretches in a semicircle round the Gulf of Nauplia ; Laconia, around the Grulf of Loloky- 
thi; Messenia, occupying the south-west; Eiis on the west coast, and Achala on the, 
north. The two latter are hilly, with small river valleys, but rather dry. 

The Cyclades, and the other islands in the Archipelago, are almost edl steep and rocky. 
Eiiboea is traversed, throughout its whole length, by a ridge of hills, and is separated from 
the mainland of eastern Hellas by a very long channel or strait, so narrow at the midtfie 
as to be spanned by a bridge. 

The mountains which cover so large a portion of the country are partly wooded and 
partly naked ; the woods abound most on the west side. The low country, susceptible 
of tillage, probably does not amount to two-fifth parts of the surface, and not more thta 
a twelfth part of it is under cultivation. Its want of enclosures, the thinness of its popu- 
lation, the ruinous condition of its cottages, commingled with the crumbling remaiiÂ» 
of noble structures, give it a deserted, desolate, and melancholy appearance ; and towards 
the end of summer, the whole seems parched. 

Five million acres are computed as being adapted to agriculture ; 1,750,000 acres ts 
woodland ; 180,000 as vineyards, and 4,500 acres as currant-plantations. The Corinthian 
grape or currant is almost peculiar to the Morea and the Ionian Islands. The number of 
oli/e-trees amounted, in 1845, to 723,101. The number of black cattle was, in the same 
year, only 110,114 heads; of horses (of small breed, but enduring), 84,72S; of mules, 
23,956 ; of common asses, 63,754; of hogs, 78,292; of goats, 1,876,269 ; and of sheep, 
2,442,769. The rearing of the silk-worm and of bees is considerable. 

The manufactures are small in amount, and consist chiefly of carpets, canvas, and 
morocco leather. 

Li 1840, the imports were at the aggregate value of $13,507,000, and the exports at 
the value of 1 3,848,000. The Greek merchant vessels amounted, in 1843, to 3469, of the 
burthen of 137,508 tons, and were navigated by 19,000 men. In 1845, they had increased 
to 3,314, which were navigated by 20,000 men. The Ghreeks are the best sailors in the 
Mediterranean, and in the art of ship-building they are likewise highly skilled. ' 

The dominant race are the " Hellenes," who claim to be the descendants of the ancient 
people who rendered this country so famous ; but ihey have unquestionably received a 
large proportion of barbaric blood, particularly by intermixture with the Sclavonians. 
They are a rude and unenlightened people, with all the vices of slaves and fe\e redeem- 
ing virtues, but they are ingenious, active, enterprising, and restless ; and now that ihey 
have received some degree of national independence and civil liberty, they may be able 
to turn their talents to account in re-acquiring a portion of that civilization and learning 
they formerly diffused over western Europe. Their language, the Romaic, bears a mudi 
closer resemblance to the ancient Greek than the Italian does t-o the Latin. The **Ar- 
nauts," or Albanians are very numerous, and have generally preserved their national 
manners, dress, and language. They chiefly dwell in the cities of Hellas, and in some 
portions only of the Morea. The " Mainotes,*' who boast that they descend from the an- 
cient Spartans, inhabit the mountains of the south. They are a wild and lawless race, 
living under a sort of patriarchal feudal government, exercised by hereditary chiefs. 
The total amount of the population, in 1837, was 926,000, and may probaly now count, 
in round numbers, 950,000. 

The government is a constitutional monarchy, but the elements of its political system

Tbe cooDcil of the State la cempoaed of three Viee-preaidcnts, 17 ConnciUoTB in ordinary, 
Mid 14 special Councillors. In 1834, Athens was dedared to be the capital. For admin- 
istrative purposes, the kingdom is divided into twenty-four "nomoi," or governments, 
and seven snb-govemments. The defensive means coneiet of 13,000 men of all arms, 
besides the militia ; and they have a navy which anmbMn 33 amaU vessela, carrying 190 
guos and 3,400 men. The revenue amonnts to abont 14,500,000 drachms, or about 
$3,500,000; but the expenditure, in most years, exceeds tbla sum. The public debt is 
abont 135,000,000. 

Since the 4th August, 1833, the established religion of the State has been that of the 
" Orthodox Oriental Apostolic Church," of which the king is the head. Its government 
is vested in a " Holy Synod," which meets annually, and consists of a president and Bve 
other members, with two secretaries. There are 33 bishops of the Greek Church ; and 
Roman Catholic bishops at Naxos, Tinos, Syra, and Sftntorini. The Greeks are very 
jealous of their religion, and will not admit of propagandism. 

Education, until lately, has been entirely neglected; even the priests were illiterate; 
bat under the new regime a respectable system of instruction has been eatablished. At 
Athens there is a university, with 30 professors ; a gymnasium, with 8 professors ; a 
high school; a normal school for the education of tÂ«achers; and three Lancasterian 
schools. These are all supported by government ; and the scholars are promoted from 
the lower to tbe higher on certificates of competency, for which there appears to be great 
competition. In the other parts of the kingdom, there are four gymnasia, and abont two 
or throe hundred primary and secondary sohoola, partly paid from the tzeasury. 



No great period has elapsed since tbe inhabitants ci Snrope were accustomed to look 
towards the nations of Asia with the awe and revÂ»enoe which acknowledged superiority 
inspires. These eastern nations were supposed far to excel those of tlic west, in wealth 
as well as in science. They were imagined to have a nearer and firmer bold upon those 
treasures of ancient wisdom formerly supposed to be the only sources of human enlight- 
enment. Though imagination and the customary exaggeration of travellers contributed 
not a little to these nntions, yet two or three hundred years ago they were not altogether 
aaioanded in fact At that period, Aua could show four extensive and powerful empires, 



far exceeding, in the numbers of their people and in the amount of tbcir revenue anjtliii 
that Europe could boast of. Besides the Chinese empire, there was the Mogakea^ 
in Hlndostan ; the kingdom of Persia, then extensive, flourishing, and united ; and theOl 
toman empire, which, at that period, was the dread of all Europe. Bat while, iah^ 
the last two or three centuries, Europe and the European colonies have been adTaiid^ 
in the career of wealth and improvement, with constantly^ccelerating strides, the ii 
habitants of Asia have been stationary or declining. Throughout all that vast extent d 
country and population, except indeed in a few spots, where the influence of EoropeÂ® 
has been felt, there is nothing of that curiosity, activity, enterprise, and bustle, by wind 
all the nations of Europe are at present more or less distinguished. There exists npa 
the Asiatics an excessive reverence for all old customs, and for everything establktel 
They still hold to the dogma, which once prevailed in Europe, but which now is geno^j 
repudiated, that modern times and modern men are inferior to those of antiquity; z^ 
that wisdom is to be acquired not by looking forward but by looking backward. Ittsa 
doctrine currently received throughout the entire East, that whatever happens is lok 
quietly submitted to, as the decree and ordinance of Providence, which it is in vain to nÂ» 
sist. Success, no matter by what means obtained, is there regarded as a mark of Divii 
favor, and the successful man is submitted to, and almost worshipped, as the chosen neti 
gerent of God. These theological views, though in speculation not confined to Aaa, hm 
a vast deal greater influence over practical life in the East than in the West; andtkv 
serve to explain, to a considerable extent, the peculiar political and social condition of 8 
those countries. Power is worshipped there, as being a direct emanation from the Ddti 
An usurper or political adventurer, successful in one or two battles or intrigues, acqninn, 
by that very success, a prestige which works powerfully in his favor. The same op 
ions were, at one time, prevalent in Europe. At that time, it was customary to empioj 
the ordeal, or the wager of battle, as a means of judicial investigation. These notKMs, 
which at present have no practical influence in Europe, are still in full vogue intheEa^j 
and combine with the political and social institutions of those countries to produce i 
state of torpidity and negligence inconsistent with improvement The consequence is, 
that the active and progressive nations of Europe are constantly extendiog tbeir iofb 
ence and power over Asia ; and that ancient continent, whence was derived the esif 
civilization of Europe, seems likely to receive back again from Europe a higher ad 
more expansive civilization. Russia and Great Britain are the two powers whii 
exercise, at present, the greatest influence in Asia. Russia is carrying on a peipetd 
war against the mountaineers of Caucasus and the wandering tribes of Tarteiy; aai 
though occasionally or temporarily repulsed, is gradually and surely reducing them undo 
her control. Russia exercises a predominating influence in Persia: she has obtained i 
sort of joint authority over the Turkish provinces of Moldavia and Wallachia; andsh 
keeps her eye constantly fixed on the maritime provinces of Turkey, and even upon Cofr 
stantinople itself. 

Great Britain, in the course of about three quarters of a century, through the agency 
of a trading (tompany, has superseded the Great Mogul and the princes who had divided 
among them the fragments of the Mogul empire, all of whom have been reduced, by tk 
British, to a tributary condition, or entirely stripped of their dominions. But the influence 
of Great Britain is not confined within the boundaries of its Indian territories. It is felt 
more or less, by all the neighboring nations. Though repulsed from Afghanistan, Bur- 
mah is passing under British control ; and, in prosecution of the recent opium-war, ^ 
British arms were carried even into China, hitherto almost inaccessible to Europeans, 
but which, by the planting of Anglo- American colonies on the American Paraguay coa^ 
is brought, more and more, into the circle of Europeon intercourse. There can indeed 
be but littie doubt that the next century will see changes, still more remarkable than the 
last, in the opinions, institutions, and social life of the Asiatics. 



OTTOMAN EMPIRE. 
XV. OTTOMAN EMPIRE. 



SmyniA. 

ThoQgh the Ottoman empire includea, within its nominal sway, portions of Europe 
aod Africa, as well as of Aaia, yet, as the Turks originated in Asia, whence they extended 
their conquests into Europe and Africa, they are properly to be recltoned among the Asi- 
atics. There have been, within the period of history, several Turkish empires, that ia, ex- 
tensive kingdoms founded by tribes of the same general origin, and speaking dialects of 
the s^me language with the Ottomans. The present Turkish empire took its rise about 
CtoO years ago, with Othman, a shepherd and robber, head of a small migratory clan, 
who first pillaged and then conquered the portions of Asia Minor bordering on the Black 
Sea, Under a succession of enterprising princes they gradually extended their conquests, 
till Mohammed IL, A. D. 1453, took Constantinople, subjected the remaining fragments 
of the Greek empire, and spread terror throughout Europe. The Turks, thus become the 
successors of the Roman empire of the East, remained dreaded and formidable for mora 
than than 200 years. The conquest of Egypt by Selim I. in 1518, put into his power the 
descendant of the old line of caliphs of Bagdad, â€” a family which had, 250 years before, 
fled before the Mongols and taken refuge with the Mamelukes of Egypt, under whom 
they had lived obscure and powerless, though still claiming, as the regular descendanta 
of the prophet, to be the spiritual heads of the Mohammedan religion. Sclim procured 
from the last of this family, a renunciation of the caliphate in his favor ; and ever since 
that time, the Turkish sultans have claimed not only a temporal but a spiritual sove- 
n^ignty, aa being the legal head of all true Mohammedans, and the authorized guardian 
of the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. 

The Persians, however, who have always been at enmity with the Turks, refused to ac- 
knowledge this spiritual supremacy. Shah Ismael, who about this time, when this claim 
was first set up, had reunited the broken fragments of Persia into a consolidated empire, 
revived at the same time the faith of Ali, according to which the true caliphate had de- 
scended in the line of Ali the husband of Fatima, Mohammed's daughter ; and as Has- 
san the son of Ali had been displaced and murdered by Moawiyah the founder of the 
Ommiades, under whom the Turkish sultan claimed, that claim was pronounced by the 
FcrBians wholly baseless and unfounded. This dispute about the true line of the caliph- 
ate, had early divided the Mohammedans into two bitterly hostile sects, called Sonnxtes 
and Shiiies. The Shiite faith had fallen into obscurity ; but when the sultan of Turkey 
dainied to be the legal bead of the Sonnito party, it was ivvived by the king of Persia,

for political reasons, as he did not choose to acknowledge a rival prince as the spirilBi! 
head of their common religion ; and thus revived, it contiiiaea to exist in fall vigor toir 
present day. 

The Turks always were, as they are now, a small and in some districts inconsi(kÂ» 
ble portion of the population of the countries which they govern. Even among the 3i& 
hammedan population of those countries, they are quite in the minority. The pcfsi- 
nency of their power has been remarkable, and far exceeds anything which history leoodi 
of the numerous other Asiatic empires founded and governed in the same way. TJass 
to be explained by the institution of the Janizaries, an institution established as long ap 
as 1360, and to which the permanency and power of the Ottoman empire is pnod^ 
to be ascribed. The Janizaries were a standing army of a very peculiar codstriKtksi 
They were all slaves purchased when boys, and bred up to arms and a bigoted attaek- 
ment to the Mohammedan faith. They were selected, in the first place, for their robfR- 
ness and manly beauty ; and the exercises in which they spent their lives, contribfitM 
to develop these qualities. It was from this body that almost all the military leaders m 
governors of provinces were selected. In Turkey, inheritance of power, except io tk 
family of the sultan, was almost unknown. The children of the pashas, brought op it 
the seraglios, were for the most part effeminate and spiritless ; the glory and powÂ» of tV 
Turkish empip was supported by a succession of chiefs from the ranks of the Janizanr^ 
who though Turks in name and by education, were not so in blood, as all the we&Itkic 
of them supplied their seraglios with Caucasian beauties, thus gradually changed xlxt 
race, and from being one of the ugliest, became one of the handsomest of nations. Tbot 
persons who bear, at present, the name of Turks, have but very little if any Toikisi 
blood, and bear hardly any personal * resemblance to the Turkomans and Tartars fim 
which stock they derive their name. 

. The idea of the institution of the Janizaries was perhaps derived from the MamelaiKi 
of Egypt, a similar body of slaves trained to arms, who ruled that country for near f j 
hundred years. They indeed acknowledged the supremacy of Selim L and his succt- 
sors, but they continued the actual rulers of Egypt till they were btoken by the Frem: 
invasion in 1798, and finally extirpated by the arts and arms of Ali Pasha. 

It is evident that an institution like the Janizaries, notwithstanding that luxury arri 
effeminacy in which the Turks indulged, and which always waste away every simik 
tribe of barbarian conquerors, had a tendency to preserve the military power of the Turis 
fresh and vigorous ; and so long as military power was mainly dependent upon the per- 
sonal prowess and courage of the soldiers, they remaiYied a full match for ajiy of tbfi' 
Christian neighbors." It was only the vast improvements and changes in the art of d- 
struction, which European science has introduced within the last two hundred years, ai^ 
of -which the Janizaries remained in a great measure ignorant, that threw the Tmks iii:^ 
the back ground. 

But if the Janizaries were the support of the Ottoman empire, they presently becanK 
the tyrants of the sultans, whom they deposed and murdered at pleasure. The soltai^ 
long struggled against their overwhelming power, but without success, till finally the late 
sultan Mahmoud II. succeeded in breaking up and abolishing the Janizaries and intro 
ducing a standiilg army, on the European plan. There can be litUe doubt that this step 
will hasten the downfall of the Turkish empire, which has long been in a declining state, 
and is only kept together by the mutual jealousy of the great European powers ; or -: 
least, if the empire subsists, that it will lead to the curtailment or abolition of the speciaJ 
privileges enjoyed by the Turks, and will lead to its reconstruction after European mod- 
els. It is composed, at present, of certain districts more immediately under the autboriTy 
of the sultan, and of others which have their own princes, who acknowledge a superiority, 
in several cases merely nominal, in the Ottoman Porte. 

Under the first head are included, in Europe, the provinces of RumeliOy Bulgariif 
Albania and Bosnia (the ancient Thrace, Moesia, Epirus, and Pomerania), Macâ‚¬d(h 
niaj Thessaly^ Candia^ and most of the islands of the Archipelago, together witii 
Anatolia^ and a number of other Asiatic provinces (the ancient Asia Minor, Sjria, 
Mesopotamia, and part of Armenia). These countries, once so rich and flourbhii^'{for 



OTTOMAN BMPIER Wf 

'he O- toman dominion is nearly coextensive with, as in fact it is the successor of, the old 
Roman empire of the East), are at present, for the most part, in a wretched and declin- 
.ng state. In the Asiatic portions of it, the whole country, out of the walls of the cities, 
8 exposed to be plundered by wandering tribes, Arabs, Kurds, and Turkomans, who com- 
bine the professions of shepherds and robbers, and who maintain a sort of independence 
in the deserts and mountains. What they leave, is liable to be extorted from the unhappy 
3ultivators by the arbitrary power of the Turkish military rulers. The cities are, for the 
most part, but mouldering fragments of what they once were. The damages occasioned 
t>y fire, inundations, earthquakes, or hostile armies, are seldom repaired; and the accu- 
mulated results of former productive and industrious ages are gradually wasting away. 

Und^r the second head, or that of tributary provinces, we may reckon : 1. Moldavia^ 
JVaf/achia, and Servia; the population of which are principally Christians of Sclavonic 
iescent, and which are ffoverned by princes of their own, over whose appointment the 
sultan has but a limited influence; 2, the pachalic of I^ypt and its appurtenances, now 
made hereditary in the family of AJi Pasha ; 3. the sheriff of Mecca^ and the beys of 3V 
nis and Tripoli^ who at present hardly acknowledge, except as it meets their own conve- 
nience and wishes, the supremacy claimed by the Porte. 

The present sultan, Abul Musid, does not mherit the talent and energy of his father; 
yet he sustains and carries out the changes which his father introduced, and which are 
Â§pradually producing their effect, in spite of the efforts of the more bigoted Turks to pre- 
vent it He is the first Turkish monarch who has no* murdered his brother ! This danger- 
3tis relative lives, and is recardecj as the head of the old Turkish party. The sultan ab- 
hors war and detests capital punishments. He has a great fondness for music ; but, after 
[earning it all his life, he has only been able to play one tune on the piano: it is a march, 
which the sultan obligingly plays for everybody, on all occasions. He is also very fond 
of champagne, which he drinks, under the pretence that the Koran only forbids fer 
naented drinks. The tendency of the recent changes is to abolish the insolent superiority 
which the Mohammedans have hitherto claimed and exercised over the Christians and 
those claiming to be Turks, over the Mohammedans of Sclavonic and Arab descent; and 
at the same time to introduce, in place of Mohammedan barbarism, ignorance, and des- 
potic and lawless oppression, the arts, sciences, and regular jurisprudence of Europe. 

For some time arter the dissolution of the Janizaries, the military power of the empire 
was contemptible : but there is now a well disciplined army, after the European model, 
of 120,000 men. The sultan also has a fleet of some ten ships of the line, with the pro- 
portion of smaller vessels. Any estimate of the population is merely conjectural ; but, 
for the whole empire, it may be reckoned at 28,000,000, half Mussulmen and half Chris- 
tians. 

Antiqtdties â€” Nineveh. â€” The Turkish empire includes the countries Egypt, Syria, 
and Mesopotamia, in which the most ancient memorials of the human race exist. It is 
not long since a great interest was excited by the exploration of the ancient excavated 
tombs of Petrea, in the neighborhood of Akaba, at the head of the Red Sea. The public 
curiosity has, of late, been greatly gratified by the researches of Mr. Layard, at the 
nnounds of Mosul, on the Upper Tigris, the seat of the ancient Nineveh. This great city 
was ruined, and abandonee! previously, it is probable, to the date of any existing wTitten 
composition. Little was known of it, except the incidental notices in the Hebrew Scrip- 
tures, and some vague rumors preserved by the Greeks, of its former greatness. When 
Xenophon with his Greeks passed the, mounds of Mosul, 2250 years ago, he found them 
in much the same state in which they now are ; nor until very lately was anything known 
of them but the tradition that the great city of Jfineveh once stood there. 

Layard's first visit to Assyria was in 1840 ; he was accompanied by a single com- 
panion, with whom he had travelled through eveiy portion of Syria. He was at once 
fully persuaded that these mounds contained hidden treasures ; and before leaving the 
country he formed the purpose of thoroughly examining them whenever it might be in 
his power. The people inhabiting that neighborhood were entirely ignorant of the former 
history of the country ; so completely was every trace of its pride and power buried from 
Â«^iew. The idea that they were dwelling above the ruins of a city that was eighteen 
leagues around it, surrounded by a wall an hundred feet high, and so broad that three

harlots could drive abreast upon it, â€” a city that contained, besides its gigantic palaces, 
fteen hundred towers, each two hundred feet high, â€” that six hundred thousand human 
eings ever dwelt upon tibat plain, now occupied by a few scattered villages â€” was to 
liem a fabrication of the unbelievers, and a conception dishonorable to the memory of the 
^rophet. 

Keceiving at last the offer of extensive aid in funds, Mr. Layard returned to Assyria 
a November, 1845, and entered upon the difficult task of excavating the mounds at Nim- 
oud ; he also made less extensive examinations at Kalah Shergbat and Kouyunjik. In 
Vprii, 1847, he abandoned his efforts, and in 1848 gave to the world the result of his labors, 
ti two volumes, entitled ^' Nineveh and its Remains." This work thoroughly aroused the 
>ublic interest in the subject. It was at once perceived that the information which it 
tontained was of great importance and full of fresh illustrations of history, sacred and 
>rofane. Col* Bawlinson and Dr. Hincks had made some progress in translating the cu- 
leiform writing found on the disinterred monuments. Mr. Layard's labors had been 
>reaiaturely abandoned, and there was a general desire that he should be furnished with 
neans to make a thorough examination. Such an arrangement was finally effected with 
;he Trustees of the British Museum* In the meantime Col. Rawlinson and Dr. Hincks 
pursued their studies ; so that while Mr. Lavard was uncovering the ruins of the long- 
est cities, they were able to confirm his rendering of inscriptions found upon them, and 
;o translate those which a less methodical study did not enable him to understand. 

Passing through Armenia to the Lake Wan, Mr. Layard and his party proceeded south 
:o the valley of the Tigris, where they came upon the route of the celebrated retreat of the 
.en thousand Greeks. Oct 12, 184Â§, the party reached Mosul. This was selected as 
their head-quarters, but detachments of workmen were stationed at several points in the 
[leighborhood. In December following, at Kouyunjik, a facade of an immense building 
wras uncovered ; it proved to be the grand entrance to the magnificent palace of Sennache- 
rib. Mr. Layard, in describing this valuable discovery, says : <' The facade opened into 
a i^de portal, guarded by a pair of winded bulls, twenty feet long and probably, when 
entire, more than twenty feet high. Formmg the angle between them and the other bulls, 
were gigantic winged figures in low relief,* and flanking them were two smaller figures, 
one above the other. Beyond this entrance was a group similar to and corresponding 
with that on the opposite side, also leading to a smaller entrance into the palace, and to 
a viraii of sculptured slabs ; but here all traces of buildings and sculpture ceased, and we 
found ourselves near the edge of a water-worn ravine. 

** Thus, a facade of the south-east side of the palace, forming apparently the ^nd en- 
trance to the edifice, had been discovered. Ten colossal bulls, with six human figures of 
gigantic proportions, were grouped together, and the length of the whole, without includ- 
ing the sculptured walls, continued beyond the smaller entrances, was 180 feet. .... 
On the great bolls, forming the centre portal to the grand entrance, was one continuous 
inscription, injured in parts, but still so far preserved as to be legible throughout. It con- 
tainea 152 lines. On the four bulls of the facade were two inscriptions, one inscription 
being carried over each pair, and the two being of precisely the same import These two 
distinct records contain the annals of six years of the reign of Sennacherib, besides nu- 
merous particulars connected with the religion of the Assyrians, their gods, their temples, 
and the erection of their palaces, all of the highest interest and importance.'' 

It was not, however, until August,.1851, that the mention of any actual event recorded 
in history, was deciphered upon the monuments. Since that period, many of the lead- 
ing events chronicled in the Old Testament^ have been confirmed by inscriptions found 
upon the walls of buildings and other objects which have been exhumed. There Ls no 
lon^r any doubt as to the king who reared these monuments. Mr. Layard has actually 
exiMored the ruins of the very palace of Sennacherib â€” a building, by the way, which not 
only justifies the references which arc made in the Bible to the pride and dignity of the 

* These and other extraordinary figures, socli as winged human-headed lions and bulb, found among the 
ruins in Assjrria, show very clearly horn whence Ezekiel and Daniel obtained many of their remarkable illua- 
tralions, and are strong confirmations of the Biblical account of the Captivity, which represents them both to

Unable to superintend the works during the heat of the summor-:â€” all his cotnpaoioa) 
having failed by intermittent fever â€” Mr. Lavard, sick and half-deKrious, left for the 
mountains of the North. Instead however of resting, as the state of his health seems lo 
have required, we find him soon after entering upon a tour which he has thus outlined : 
"While necessarily absent, I determined to visit those parts of Central Ku^di^tnn noi m 
explored by European travellers, to devote some days to the examination of the ruin? ud 
cuneiform inscriptions in and near the city of Wan, and then to return to Mo?nl throti|li 
the unexplored uplands to the south of the lake of Wan, and by such of the Ni^torisn 
valleys as I had not seen during my former journey in the mountains. I should tbeo 
BDend the hottest part of the summer in the cool regions of Kurdistan, and be again at 
Nineveh by September, when the heats began to decline." About the middle of Odotm 
we find our persevering traveller floating down the Tigris upon a raft, accompanied bj 
several of his companions and some thirty of the best Arabs, whum he had employed la 
the excavations at Nineveh, Unexpected difficulties presented themselves at Bagdad. 
The whole country was overrun with Bedouins and other tribes in open revolt against thr 
government, so as to render it unsafe to leave the city. But there was " no such word as 
fail." Shovels and pickaxes were brought into requisition upon the spot, for the whole 
Mesopotamia!) plain is dotted with mounds. His labors were rewarded by discoveriu| 
â€¢everai hollow bronze balls, with the name of a king engraved upon them in Babyloniao 
cuneiform characters; a few rude images of the As^jyrian Venus, in baked clay, ^iicb as 
are found in most ruins of the same period ; a pair of bronze ankle-rings, scvt-raJ teriB- 
cotta vases and other relics of the same nature. The party reached Babylon early in Dt- 
cember. We have not room here for any statement of their labors. Side journeys wprf 
made to villages in the Jezireh and the marshes of Niffir, which are described with giKii 
spirit. Greatly disturbed by the unsettled state of the country, Mr. Layard and his cori- 
pany returned to Mosul by the land-route upon the western side of the Ti<Tris ; havins 
been absent about three months. On the 28th of April, he bade a final adii-u to Ninevi L

Ufibrs from that of the temperate parts of Europe and America, more in the alternation 
Â»f \ret and dry seasons than in the degrees of temperatore. The yariatioQe of rain and 
lunshine, which in the west exist thronghont the whole year, are in Palestine confined 
^liiefly to the latter part of the autumn and winter, while the remaining months ex^j 
i.lfno8t uninterruptedly a cloudless sky. The autumnal tains usually begin in Octobcur 
3Lud November; not suddenly, but by degrees, which gives oppcurtunity for the husband- 
raan to sow his wheat and barley. The rains come mostly from the west and south* 
west, continuing for two or three days at a time, and falling especially during the otj^ht 
Xhen the wind shifts to the north or east, and sereral days of fine weaker succeeds 
Daring November and December the rains fall heavily, and continue more or less copir 
ously throuffh the winter. Snow often falls* in Jerusalem in January and February, to 
the depth of a foot or more, but does not lie long. The ground never freezes. March is 
rainy, but after this month rain is rare. The whole period from October to March is 
one continued season of rain, withqut any regularly intervening term of prolonged fair 
Aveather. Unless, therefore, there has been some chaAge in the fflimate since the times 
of the New Testament, the '^ early and the latter rains," for which the husbandman 
Avaited with longing, seem rather to have implied the first showers of autumn, which 
revived the parched and thirsty earth, and prepared it for the seed â€” and the later 
showers of spring, which continued to refresh and forward both the ripening crops and 
the vernal products of the fields. 

During the whole winter, the roads, or rather tracks, in Palestine, are muddy, deepi 
and slippery, so that the traveller, at that season, suffers the utmost discomfort ana inconÂ» 
venience. When the rains cease, the mud soon disappears and the roads become hard^ 
though never smooth. Whoever, therefore, wishes to profit most by a journey in Pales- 
tine, will take care not to arrive in Jerusalem earlier than the end of March. During 
April and May, the sky is usually serene, the air mild and balmy, and the face of nature, 
alter seasons of ordinary rain, still green and pleasant to the eye. Showers occur occa- 
sionally, but they are mild and refreshing. In ordinary seasons, from the cessation of the 
showers of spring until their commencement in October or November, rain never falls, 
and the sky is usually serene. If during the winter there has been a sufiiciency of rain, 
the husbandman is certain of his crop, and is also perfectJy sure of fine weather for the 
in-gathering of his harvest The harvest upon the mountains ripens later than in the 

Elains of the Jordan and on the sea-coast The barley harvest precedes the wheat 
arvest by a week or fortnight The wheat is harvested early in June, about Hebron ; 
at Jericho, about a month earlier. The first grapes ripen in July, and from that tim^ 
until November, Jerusalem is abimdantly supplied with this delicious fruit The general 
vintage takes place in September. In autumn the whole land becomes dry and parched, 
the cisterns are nearly empty, the few streams and fountains fail, and all nature, vegetap- 
ble and animal, looks forward with longing to the return of the rainy season. 

Population and Inhabitants. The Christian population of Syria and Palestine em- 
braces about 500,000 souls. These are divided into the following eight sects ; namely, 
Greeks, Greek Catholics, Maronites, Syrians or Jacobites, Syrian Catholics, Armenians, 
Armenian Catholics, and Latins. 

L Greeks, These are the most numerous of the Christian sect They are so called in 
Syria merely because they profess the Greek faith and belong to the Greek church. 
There are now no traces, either in their spoken language or in the language of their 
public services, of any national affinity with the Greek people. They are Arabs, hke 
the other Arabs of the country. Nor, on the other hand, are there any indications of a 
Syriac origin in any part, with the exception of Malula and its vicinity, or Anti-LebanoUi 
north of Damascus. In this region, the dialect now spoken, as well as the old church- 
books, long since indeed disused, show that the inhabitants are originally of the Syriac 
ntce. With this exception, the language of the Greek Christians of Syria, both as spoken 
and as used in their churches, is Arabic. The spoken Arabic differs so little from the 
)anguage of books, that all books written in a plain style are intelligible to the comnaon 
pe(^e. Hence it will be seen that these Christians enjoy the great privilege of having 
their religious worship conducted in a language which they understand, a privile^ 



iwM to those of tbo swno dnuch who speak the Gveek toÂ«igÂ«ei and to enmrjr 
Christiaii sect in Western Asia, except their countrymen and relatives, the Gredc Catfcs< 
lies. Perhaps, however, it should be added that their church-books contain aMtaf 
untranslated technical tenns from the Greek, and that on many occasions, oertejn piff- 
tions of- the services, or even the whole, are sometimes said in Oredc This is mm 
frequently the case when the hk;h clergy officiate. It is an impOTtant fact that oesrif; 
if not quite, all the bishops or this sect are Greeks by birth, and foreigviess in tke 
countryâ€” *a circumstance which shows how great an inflinace the see of Coastantiasph 
exerts in the ecclesiastical affietirs of Syria. These bishops mrely leam to speak the 
Arabic language, which, of coarse, they cannot preach, and their medium of in^cnoam 
with the peOjue in conversation, is very imperfect There is, in conseqaeiice, little d 
thai unity of national feeling between the bishop and his flock, which misht lead to 
national improvement, especially in education. A Gredr bishop from abrcMO, able ady 
to stammer Arabic, and perhaps not readinpf it at all, and regarding it only as a baitA* 
lous dialect, (a feeling which is inherent m almost every Gredc, by birth,) cannot hi 
expected to take much interest in promoting a system of national education anaosg ha 
flock, and nothing of the kind has yet been done. There is no seminary in the 0000117 
for the education of the Greek clergy. Hie parish priests are taken from the ranks d 
flie common people, with no other fNreparation for the sacred office than the oereaMoy d 
OTdination. They are generally selected, each one by the parish which he is to 
from among themselves ; and the usual ordination-fee to the bishop rardy fails to 
the administration of that rite according to their wishes. These priests are riniTetsattj 
married, and differ not in character from the rest of the people, frequently pmrsning die 
same occupation as before they assumed the ecclesiastical diaracter. They are ofien thi 
schoolmasters cf their^ Villages, if that can be called a school which consists of some 
half a dozen boys coming together at irregular hours, and repeating an imperfect lesasa, 
while the teacher is working at his trade. 

llie doctrines and ceremonies of the Greek church in Syria are the same as m other 
countries. In its ecclesiastical organization the church is divided mto the two patri- 
archal dioceses of Antioch and Jerusalem, an arrangement which has exi^ied ever sinoe 
the fifth century. These are nominally bofli independent of the Greek patriarch of 
Gonstantinople, but are really to a ^reat extent under his control The head of tbt 
diocese of Antioch, is ordinarily styled '' Patriarch of Antioch and of all the East'* 
The Syrian bishoprics under his jurisdiction, are the following: 1. Beinnit, which is dM 
largest, and its occupant is staled, also, " Bishop of Phenicia on the coast ; 2. Trinolis. 
3. Akkar; 4. Laodicea; 6. Uamah; 6. Hems or Emessa; 7. Saidaraya and Munla: 
8. Tyre. Aleppo formerly belonged to the patriarchate of Antioch ; but it was severea 
from it not many years ago, in consequence of a dissension between the Greeks and Greek 
Catholics of that day, and has ever since remained under the ecclesiastical govÂ«mfieiH 
of Constantinople. The Patriarch of Antioch usually resides at Damascus, and from 
this circumstance is ordinarily spoken of by the people as the Patriarch of Damascus. 
He is a Greek by birth. 

The jurisdiction of the patriarchate of Jerusalem begins at Acre and extends over die 
whole of Palestine, both east and west of the Jordan. The following are the bishoprics 
subject to it: 1. Nazareth; 2. Acre; 3. Lydda; 4. Gaza; 5. Sabaste; 6. NaUoos; 
7. Philadelphia ; 8. Petra. Of these bishops, only the bishop of Acre resides widiin 
his own see ; all the rest remain shut up in the convents at Jerusalem. The patriarch 
himself is also a non-resident, living at Constantinople and never visiting his diocese. 
His place is represented, and the business of the patriarchate transacted, by a board of 
bishops at Jerusalem. 

n. Greek Catholics. The sect of Greek Catholics had its origin in a secession firom 
the Greek church in Syria, which was brought about by Roman Catholic influence about 
a century ago. Until recently, this sect existed only in Sjrria, but has now spread into 
Egypt. The Greeks who have elsewhere submitted to the pope, have g^ioaliy 
become amalgamated with the Latin church. The Greek Catholics of Syria, on the 
contrary, are a sect by themselves, constituting an oriental papal church. Thev take, 
mdeed, the occidental view of the dosma of the procession of the Holy Spirit^ DeQere 
in purgatory and the pope, eat fish in Lent, uid l^p a smaller number of fieuttmg days 
than the Greeks ; but otherwise they subjected themselves to few changes in pasdng

of di6 Qtmk chtbrdl, ia having their reUgioos derrick performea in their ntinrd 
Arabic timsiie. lliey obierre the oriental eaknodar, receive flie sacrament oi the Lord'a 
supper in both kinds as formerly, and their priests are still allowed to marry. This, 
liowever, is not done so unirersaUy as among the Arab Greek clergy* They have long 
had their own patriarch, but nntil the Egyptian rule, he unif<mnly resided in Moont 
Ljebaaon, wh^re the local authorities have tot many years been under papal influenoe. 
Ha has since removed to Damascus. The high clergy of this sect are mostly Arabs by 
birth, and at the same time educated at Rome. They thus unite a natural attachment 
to their countrjrmen with some degree of European cultivation, and the result is a cesÂ«* 
tain elevation of their sect The patriarch has also established a college for teaching 
difier^it languages and branches of science, which, however, seems as yet to have 
acoomplifibed very little. The sect embraces a large proportion of the most enterpriaing 
and wealthy Christians in Syria, and possesses great mfluence. Especially do its memÂ« 
bera occupy more than their due proportion <^ offices under the government A convent 
belongiikf to. the Ghreek Catholics at Esh^Shuweir in Mount Lebanon, has for many yean 
possessed an Arabic printing-press, which supplies their own church, and edao tho 
Oreeks, with most of Aeir church books. 

ni. Mar&niiee. This sect fumisbBS decisive evidence of a Svriac origin. Its eocle- 
aiasticai language is wholly Sjrriac, though none now understand it, except as a learned 
Imnfpmge. The Maronites also not unfrequently write Aralnc in ike Syrian character* 
llfeay acknowledge no affinity with any other sect in the country, except through a com^ 
Dum relatioBship to the pope. They are exclusive and conceited in the notion of their 
tmpwralleled orthodoxy, and are not much liked by thdr ne^bors, even of the papal 
church, being generally, accused of narrow-mindedness. Tlie Maronites are character* 
ised by an almost unequalled devotedness ta the see of R^ne, and the most implicit 
^obedience to their priests. It may be doubted whether there is to be found anywhere 
else, a people who have so sincere sCnd deep a rever^ice for lite pope as the Maronites of 
Sym. Yet they have their own distinct church establishment and aliK> some usages 
virhiefa are not tolerated in the papal church in Europe. They tollow, indeed, the occiÂ« 
dental calendar, observe the swne rules of fasting as the European papists, and celebrate 
in the same manner the sacrament of the Lord's supper. But they have some saints of - 
their own, and especially their patron saint, Mar-Maron, not elsewhere acknowledged in 
the papal church. And every candidate of the priesthood, who is not already unÂ£r the 
vow of celibacy, is allowed to marry before ordination ; so that most of their parish 
clergy are actaaUy married men. They have many bishops, and at their head, a patri-. 
arch^ who styles himself '' Patriarch of Antioch." His usual residence is the convent of 
Kanobin, <m Mount Lebanon, back of Tripolis. 

The Maronites are found in cities and large towns as far north as Aleppo, and as far 
south as Nazareth. But they are at home as cultivators of the soil only in Mount 
Lebanon. This mountain they inhabit, more or less, throughout its whole range. But 
their stronghold is Kesrawan. Of this tract, they are ahaost the only inhabitants. 
Throughout the whole of the district governed by l^nir Beshir they are more numerous 
than any other sect The balance of power which was formerly kept up between them 
and the Druses, is now entirely destroyed ; the latter having become far mfericnr in num* 
hers and strength. This is the result of the conversion of the ruling family of Emirs, 
the house of Sbehab, who were formerly Mahometans, to the Mar<mite faith. Their 
example had great influence, and has been followed by the two largest branches of 
another family of Emirs of Druse origin ; so that now almost all the highest nobility of 
the mountain are Maronites. 

In the elementary instruction of the common people, the Maronites are quite as defi- 
cient as the other Christian sects in the country. But for a select number, and espe- 
cially for clerical candidates, the Patriarch has established a college at Ain Warkah, in 
Kesrawan, which takes a higher stand than any other similar establishment in Syria. 
It deserves great praise for the thorough manner in which it initiates at least some of 
its pupils into the knowledge of their native Arabic tongue. They also study Syriac, 
Latin and Italian. 

lY. Surian$ or JucobUes. The same evidence of a Syrian origin which, exists in the 
case of the Maronites is found also among the Jacobites. Though they now speak, in 
Syria, only Arabic, yet their church-service is in Syriac. Indeed, the common name b^ 
which they are known in the country is simply ^'Syrians." The epithet JacobiiCi it

is not customary to add, aj tiiere are in the tama^ no Brians of die mrAioiaK 
rite, from whom it is necessary to distingaiA them ; and the seceders to the pa^ 
church are sufficientlv designated by the term Caftiolics. The nninber of the Jaoobito 
in Syria is very small. A fe\r families in Damaaoos and in Nebk, the â–¼iUagnc^SodM, 
and a part of the village of Knrvetein, a small eommanity in Hena, iirith a few aea^ 
tered individuals in three or four other places, eonstttute the wiiote aeet. Thflf an 
subject to the Jacobite patriarch, who resides in Mesopotamia, and from hkn tfaey^ raocin 
^eir bishops. The Jacobites are looked upon by all otfier aeete in the eoontiy as tee- 
ties, and as such, and because they are few and poor, they are goserally despiaed. 

T. Syrian CathoKcs. These bear the same relation to the Jacobites, tluit the Gmk 
Catholics do to the Greek church. They are Romish oonverts, who still F^ain te 
oriental rite, and the use of Syriac in their churches. T%e community in Aleppa hai 
long existed in its present relation to the pope. But the Syrian Catholics of Danmeni 
and of Rasheiya in Jebel-esh-Sheikh, are recent converts. Exeept in these places, then 
dre not known to be any other communities of this sect among the people of Syria, h 
Mount Lebanon there are two or three smfill convents inhabited by Syrian Oadiobe 
monks. 

YI. Armenians. The Armenians in Syria are properly to be regarded as ibreigDas. 
Tet they have been there so long, that the country has become their home ; and they 
must not be overlooked in speaking of the native Christian sects. 'Hiey are fonndl <mif 
as n;)Lerchants and mechanics in cities and large towns, and nowhere as cQiti valors d 
tfie soil. Their number is very small. Their ecclesiastioal establishment is distiset 
firom that of Constantinople. At their head is a patriarch, who is styled '^ PatriaitA d 
Jerusalem.'* 

Vn. Armenian Caikolics. These are seceders from the Armenians to the papal churA 
They adhere still to the oriental rite, and have changed few of their original eeieno- 
nies or dogmas. They are few in number, but have their patriarch, who resides in a 
convent at Bzummar, on Mount Lebanon. 

VIII. Latins. Native Roman Catholics of the occidental rite are very few in Syria. 
They exist onl^ in connection with the convents of Terra Santa at Jerusalem, Bethle- 
hem, St. John m the Desert, Nazareth, and a few other places. They are ecclesiasti- 
cally dependent on the convents, and form parishes under the immediate charge of tb% 
monks. Their language is Arabic. 

Protestants. Protestants do not exist in Syria as a nattve sect, nor in any other 
part of the Turkish empire, nor are they, as such, tolerated. The govemnnent recog- 
nises and tolerates certain known sects of Christians ; and the members of these are 
allowed to transfer their relations from one sect to another whenever they choose. But 
Protestants are not among these sects, and therefore no one is legally allowed to pro(bs 
protestantism. It is by the operation of this principle of the Turkish government, and by 
this alone, that the rise of protestantism in SyrisL is checked. Very many persons, fion 
time to time, show a strong disposition to thrdw of the dominion of their priests, nni 
claim their right to the liberty of the gospel. Probably, in 1839, neariy the whole nation 
of the Druses would have declared themselves Pjrotestants, and put themselves under 
protestant instruction, could they have had secured to them, in that profession, the same 
rights as are enjoyed by the other Christian sects. 

Mahometans and other Sects. The Mahometans, or Moslemin, who constitnte Ae 
lords of the country and the mass of the population, are Sunnites, of the orthodox faith. 
The Metanileh have their chief seat in the district Belad Besharah. They are of the 
sect of AH, and their faith is kindred to that of the Shiites of Persia. They are here 
regarded as heretics. Their chief practical characteristic is the custom neither to eat 
nor drink witK those of another religion. The Druses are at home upon Mount Lebanon, 
but dwell also as far south as the district of El-Jebel, west of Safi^, in some parts of 
Hauran, and around Damascus. They were formerly masters of the country of HouBt 
LebanoA and the adjacent coast, but are now surpassed in numbers and power by the 
Maronites. The Druses appear to have sprung up out of one of the many Mahometan 
sects (the Karmathians) of the centuries before the crusades ; and the insane Hakim, 
Caliph of Egypt, is regarded as their deity. They keep their religioiis tenets and mc- 
tices secret ; though they have formeily professed themsehres to be Mahometans. Tbfj 
certainly are not Christians, and from time to time they make furious attacks chi their 
neighbors of that faith. 



SHnnftt ^im 

Vh9 NmaAifeh are 9)90 xegftz^ad Â» ^ odbirag of qm of tbe early MptK/oyKtw 
W0t9, probably tbe Kaimathwis. They, (oo, keep their religion a secret, and ofteiK 
aooform exldmally to the faith of thoee by whom they are surrounded, whether Mus$ul< 
men or Ghrtstiaiis. Thmr chief seal is the range of mountains extending on the north 
^ Mount Lebanâ‚¬Na towards Antioch ; but they are Â£ound scattered in other places. Thq 
aoeonats from them are very imperfeot. 

The l0m0elUe8 were originally a religicHis-political subdivision of the Shiites, and are 
iiow the comparatively feeble remains of the people who became too well known i|i th^' 
<ime of the crusades, under Uie name of the ABsassins. They likewise possess a secret 
mystical religion, and still have their chief seat, as formerly, in the castle of Masyad, OQ 
thte mountains west of Hamah. 

Conventt. One of the most remarkable features of Mount Lebanon, is its multitude. 
ef convents. They are seen perched upon its rocks and scattered over its sides in every, 
direction. Even a glance at the mop is sufficient to excite astonishment. While 
Monaaticism has decUned, and almost gone out of date, in so many other countries, it 
ooQtiaues here to flourish in its pristine vigor. Tbe numerous convents are many of â€¢ 
them, small establishments, but they are well filled with monks, and abundantly en<- 
dowed. There are also convents of nuns. The greatest number belong to the MaroniteS| 
^ut all the other sects above^-mentioned, except the Jacobites, have at least one convent 
^d most of them several. 

All tbe convents in and around Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Ramlah, Jaifa and other cities/ 
whether Greek, Armenian or iiatin, belong entirely to foreigners, and are occupied by 
tfaem. Convents of native monks are very rare, except in the district of Mount Lebanon. 

Formerly all the Christians of Jerusalem paid their taxes to the government through. 
their respective convents ; that ia, the monasteries were the collectors of the taxeÂ» â€” a 
aystem which gave (^portunity for great extortion on the part of the convents. The 
Egyptian government abolished this system. No Jirdeh^ or ordinary cavitation tax, ia 
paid by any of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, whether Mahometan, Christian or JeW| 
oecause it is regacded as a sacred place, and because of the poverty of the people. The 
inhabitants of Uie villages pay tbe firdeh. Mehemet Ali also abolished all the tolls and 
tribute which were formerly so oppressive to the pilgrims and travellers. 

The taxes paid to the government by the rural population are as follows : one piastre 
(about five cents) for every ewe and she goat ; ten piastres for every ass ; twenty for 
every horse and mule ; thirty for every camel and seventy -five for every ox. One 
piastre for every olive-tree, and thirty-five for each acre of fig-trees or vineyards.. 
Ab fast as men are taken away for soldiers, the capitation tax is divided among the 
remainder, ao that the government takes care to lose nothing. 

. Of all the native population of this country, tbe Arabic is the vernacular tongue, as 
much so as the English in London, or the French in Paris. The Jews are, for the most 
part, not natives 01 the country, and speak a corrupt medley of tongues among them- 
selves. Among other foreigners, the Greek, Armenian, and Italian languages, are also 
found ; but whoever desires to gain access to the common people, whether Mahometans 
or Christians, can do it only through the medium of the Arabic. 

Of the Jews now resident in Palestine, the greater number are such as have come up 
to the land of their fathers, in order to spend the remainder of their lives and die in one 
of the four holy places, Jerusalem, Heoron, Tiberias or Safed. Those in Jerusalem 
desire to lay their bones in ^he valley of Jehoshaphat. They come hither from all parts 
of the Levant, and especially from Smyrna, Constantinople and Salonica, in which 
eities there are many thousands of this people. The Jews of Jerusalem are mostly very 
poor and wretched. A considerable amount of money is collected for them by their 
emissaries in difierent countries, but as it comes into the hands of the Rabbins, and is 
managed by them without responsibility, it is administered in a very unfaithful manner, 
and serves chiefly as a means of increasing their own influence over the conduct ana 
consciences of their poor brethren. Most of tbe Jews in Palestine appear to be of Spanish 
or Polish origin, very few are from Germany or can speak the German language. 

The very motive which leads them thus to return to the Land of Promise, shows 
th^ strons attachment to their ancient faith : they are in fact the most bigoted of all their 
lept, and the least accessible to the labors 0/ Christis^i missipnaries. 

At Nablus or Nabulus are thâ‚¬| Samaritans, a singular and feeble remnant of an ancient 
Ijeople, who to this day jiave survived the storms of age? and of adverse ixuBiueqces upon

does not differ essentially from that of the other natives of the country. Tliey kSep fti 
Saturday as their Sabbath, with great strictness, idloving no labor nor tradiag, Bot efis 
eooking nor lighting a fire, but resting from their employments the whole day. Qb 
Friday evening they pray in their houses, and on Saturday have public prayers in 4dr 
synagogues, at morning, noon and evening. They meet also in the syn^Lgogcte on tbe 
great festivals, and on the new moons, but not every day. The law is read in pddic, 
not every Sabbath day, but only upon the festivals. Four times a year they go up fi) 
Mount Gerizim, in solemn procession, to worship ; and then they begin reading the lav 
as they set off, and finish it above. The seasons are, the Feast of Uie Passorer, w1m& 
they pitch their tents on the mountains all nig^tâ€ž and sacrifice seven lambs at samet: 
(he day of Pentecost; the Feast of Tabernacles, when they sojourn here in bootlis boih 
â€¢f branches; and lastly, the great day of Atonement, in autunm. They still .maJntaai 
(heir ancient hatred against the Jews, accuse them of departing^ from the law in nsl 
sacrificing the passover, and in various other points, as well as of ccnrrapting tbe anciait 
text, and avoid all connection with them except in trade. Their language is Aiabic. 
They have many books of prayers, commentaries, and the like, in their ancient language 
and character. They are very civil to Christian travellers, to whom they show a maoik 
script said to be 3,460 years old, but which appears to be much less ancient. Hey 
possess also manuscripts of a work professing to be the Book of Joshua ; it is a sort of 
chronicle extending from Moses to tne time of Alexander Severus, and in the period par- 
allel to the Hebrew book of Joshua, has a close resemblance to that book. 

TVavelling. The cost of horses and mules for travelling is about a dollar a day fbr 
each animal. If at any time the traveller chooses to lie by, one half is deducted. Tbt 
keeping of the animals during the journey falls upon the attendants, who also bear tbdr 
6wn expenses. ' Nothing extra is paid for the men. The horses are slender, active and 
hardy. They are fed usually only at night, commonly on barley or other grain, with 
straw. Their gait is a fast walk, never a trot ; for upon the mountains the state of tbe 
roads renders this for the most part impossible. They are sure-footed and exceeding^ 
sagacious in picking their way amone the rocks, being nearly equal to mules in tibis 
respect The horses of the Sheiks and wealthy individuals are sleek and well-fed, and 
remarkable for their activity and fleetness. The caparison of the animals for hire is not 
very splendid. Arab riding-saddles with stirrups are sometimes given, but they are 
usually narrow and hard. The common pack-saddles are better ; they are very long 
and broad, stuffed with a large mass of straw, and cover almost the whole of the animal 
The Americali consular agents in the Syrian cities are appointed by, and dependent 
on, the American consul at JBeyrout. They are usually native Christians of wealth and 
influence, with whom it is a privilege to obtain the appointment, as it secures to them |Â»o- 
tection and exemption from many of the ordinary exactions of their own government In 
return, they regard the few Americans who may happen to visit their places of residence 
as peculiarly entitled to enjoy their hospitality, and consider it a duty and privilege to 
entertain them at their own houses. But it is a part of oriental hospitality never to 
leave a guest alone by day, so that the traveller is sometimes greatly incommoded by 
what is meant for kindness and respect. Neighbors and friends come in to pay their 
civilities to the distinguished visiter, and the weary traveller is sometimes disposed to 
wish his host a little less kind and respectful. 

Cities and Towns. â€” Jeruscdem, From the very full and minute description of fltis 
city by Dr. Robinson, we make the following extracts : " On entering the gates of Jeru- 
salem, apart from the overpowering recollections which naturally rush upon the mind, I 
was, in many respects, agreeably disappointed. Prom the descriptions of Chateaubriand 
and other travellers, I had expected to find the houses of the city miserable, the streets 
filthy, and the population squalid. Yet the first impression made upon my mind was of 
a different character, nor did I afterwards see any reason to doubt the correctness of this 
first impression. The houses are in general better built, and the streets cleaner than 
those of Alexandria, Smyrna, or even Constantinople. Indeed, of all the oriental cities 
which it was my lot to visit, Jerusalem, after Cairo, is the cleanest and most solidlj 
built The streets, indeed, are narrow and very rudely paved, like those of all cities in 
the East The houses are of hewn stone, often large, and furnished with small domes 
on the roofs. These domes seem to be not merely for ornament, but are intended, on 
account of the scarcity of timber, to aid in supporting and strengthening tfie othonm

flat TOO&. There is usually <me or more over each room in a house, an^ they serve tba 
to give a greater elevation and an architectural effect to the ceiling of the room vLid 
rises within them. The streets, and the population that throngs them, may also well bo: 
comparison with those of any other oriental city ; although if one seeks here or any- 
where in the East, for the general cleanliness and thrift which characterize many emu 
of Europe and America, he will, of course, seek in vain. In our walks ihrough the ci^ 
and its environs we were struck with Ihe comparatively few pepple we met, and tlie 
indifference with which they seemed to regard us and our movements. In the city itstlf 
the bazaars were usually thronged, so that it was sometimes difficult to make one's vij 
through them. In ^e larger streets, also, there were commonty many persons passing 
to and fro ; but all the other streets were comparatively solitary. Outside of the city, i 
few peasants with their asses, wending their way to or from the gatesâ€” a few sh^herdi 
watching their flocks on the side of Mount Olivet â€” a few women with their ^VRter-ckim 
around the founlainsin the valley of Jehoshaphat. and occasionally Moslem females, veiled 
in white, sitting or strolhng among the tombs of their people; â€” these were ordinarily the 
only signs of life and activity which the stranger could perceive as he wandered around 
the former ' city of the Great King.' " 

Jerusalem has few manufactures and no exports, except the articles carried away by 
the pilgrims. The manufacture of soap is one of the principal. For this there are nine 
establishments, which appear to be of long standing. The mounds of ashes which they 
have thrown out at some distance from the city, have almost the appearaiM::e of natoni 
hills. At Easter, large quantities of perfumed soap are sold to the pilgrims. (M rf 
sesame is made to a considerable extent; for this, there are nine presses. There is also 
a large tannery for leather. All these are private property, and in the hands of Mahome- 
tans. The chief articles manufactured by the Christians, are rosaries, crucifixes, modeli 
of the Holy Sepulchre, and the like, carved in olive-wood, mother of pearl, and some- 
times the black, shining stone, found near the Dead Sea. The concourse of pilgrims at 
Easter converts the city into a sort of toy-shop or fair; immense quantities of these 
tokens are carried away, after having been consecrated by the priests. Merchants also 
resort hither at that season, from Damascus and other places, bringing goods of varioat 
kinds, which find a ready sale among the pilgrims. The annual Easier fair of Jerusa- 
lem is relatively not much less important than those of Leipzig and Frankfort 

The population of Jerusalem has been variously estimated, according to the fancy of 
different travellers, from 16,000 up to near 30,000. No doubt the number has varied 
much at different times; and'entire certainty can never be expected under an oriental 
government, where a regular census is unknown. Until within the last few years there 
appears to have been no data whatever, accessible o foimd a 

calculation. The more common estimate of late ye i been the

convent contains between 40 and 60 monks, half Italians and half Spaniards, and takes

and those not attached to the convents are usually merchants. The Coptic Christians 
tMinsist only of monks, who occupy a single convent. There is also a convent of 
AJjvssinians. 

The bazaars are situated in the middle of the city, on and near the principal c^treet. 
They consist of two or three narrow lanes, roofed over, with open ?nops each side, 
occupied by merchants and sedentary artisans. The markets are supplied by the 
peasants from the neighboring villages; there are few gardens round the city. Wheat 
appears not to grow well in the neigborhood, but is brought from other quarters. 

The country around Jerusalem is all of lime-stone fonnalion, and not particularly 
fertile. The rocks everywhere come out above the surface, which in many parts is aUo 
tbickly strewed with loose stones j and the aspect of the whole region is barren and 
dreary. Yet the olive thrives here abundantly, and fields of grain are seen in the valleys 
and level places. Neither vineyards, nor fig-trees flourish on the high ground around the 
city ; though the latter are found in the gardens below Siloam. The main dependence 
of Jerusalem for water is on its cisterns, and this has probably always been the case. 
- Almost every house in the city of any size, has one or more cisterns excavated in the 
soft lime-stone rock on which tiie city is built 

The account of Jerusalem, by Bayard Taylor, who visited it in 1852, is less favorable. 
The following paragraph, from one of his letters, gives a dark picture of the preseut 
condition of the Holy City: â€”

" Jerusalem, internally, gives no impressioo bnt that of 61th, niio, poverty, and dqgnjt 
tion. There are two or ^ree streets in the western or b^her portion of the dtj, v)m 
are tolerably clean, but all the others to the very gates of the Holy Sepulchre, are GfaÂ» 
, nels of pestilence, the Jewish quarter, which u the largest, so sickened and tii^gn^i 
me, that I should rather go the whole round of the city walls than paes throof^iii 
second time. The bazaars are poor, compared with those of other Oriental cities o( ibi 
same size, and the principal trade seems to be in rosaries, both Turkish and Chxiniu, 
crosses, seals, amulets, and pieces of the Holy Sepulchre. The population, whicb dbt 
possibly reach 20,000,is apparently Jewish, for the most part; at least, I have been ptiii- 
cipally struck with the Hebrew face, in my walks. The number of Jews has iaaeatpl 
considerably within a few years, and there is also quite a number who, having been cu- 
verted to Protestantism, were brought hither at the expense of English JVCsatouij 
Societies for the purpose of forming a Protestant community."

The mountains and deserts of Eastern Persia are at present possessed by varions 
dans of Afgbans and Belochees over whom there is no steady and permanent govern- 
poent In 1839, the En^h from India, nnder the idea that Russia was obtaininc^ an 
inAaence over the Afghans, that might be dangerous to their Indian empire, took advan- 
tage of one of those struggles for the name of supreme ruler, with which that country 
is continuatly distracted, to march an army int^ it under pretence of vindicating the right 
of one of the competitors for the throne. They penetrated the mountain passes, and first 
unveiled this country to European eyes. After some hard struggles, they got possession 
of Oabul, Kandahor, Kelut, and the other principal cities and fortresses, and all the 
tribes of the country apparently submitted to their authority. But in the winter of 
1841-42, the Afghans, who hated the English not only as conquerors but as infidels, as- 
sembled their forces, laid seige to Cabul, cut off the supplies pf provisions, and finally 
compelled the occupying army to evacuate the city under a convention, and commence 
a retreat in the dead of a winter not less severe than our own. The Hindu soldiers of 
whom the English army was principally composed, suffered greatly from a cold to 
which they were wholly unaccustomed. The convention was broken. The English 
army was attacked in the passes and was cut off almost to a man. The next spring, 
the English marched troops into the country to relieve the garrisons and occupying 
forces besieged or blockaded there, after which they evacuated and abandoned the 
country. 

The Nestorians. One of the most interesting discoveries of modern travellers has 
been that relative to the country of the Nestorian Christians, in the northern part of the 
kingdom of Persia. The tract of country in which they reside, lies between the 36th 
and 38th degrees of north latitude, a little to the south of the lake of Yan. This 
region, before little known to the rest of the world, was visited a few years since by 
Dr. Asahel Grant, and Messrs. Smith and Dwight, under the patronage or the American 
Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions. A narrative of his researches in that 
country was published during the past year by Dr. Grant, which affords many particu- 
lars of hiffh interest, respecting the people whom he visited. This traveller is of opinion 
that the Nestorians are the descendants of the lost tribes of Israel. We make the follow- 
ing extracts from Dr. Grant's work : 

" The province of Ooroomiah, in which the labors of the mission have tfius far been 
prosecuted, comprises an important part of Ancient Media, and is situated in the north* 
western part of^the modern kingdom of Persia. It is separated by a lofVy chain of 
snowy mountains from Ancient Assyria or Central Eoordistan on the west ; while on the 
east the beautiful lake extends about eighty miles in length and thirty in width. The 
water of this lake is so salt that fish cannot live in it ; its shores are enlivened by numer* 
OU8 water-fowl, of which the beautiful flamingo is most conspicuous, and sometimes 
lines the shore for miles in extent. 

A plain of exuberant fertility is enclosed between the mountains and the lake, com- 
prising an area of about five hundred square miles, and bearing upon its bosom no less 
than three hundred hamlets and villages. It is clothed with luxuriant verdure, firuitful 
fields, gardens, and vineyards, and irrigated by considerable streams of pure water from 
the adjacent mountains. The landscape is one of the most lovely in the East ; and the 
effect is not a little heightened by the contrast of such surprising fertility with the stem 
aspect of the surrounding heights, on which not a solitary tree is to be seen ; while in 
the plain, the willows, poplars, and sycamores by the water-courses, the peach, apricot, 
pear, plum, cherry, quince, apple, ana vine, impart to large sections the appearance of a 
rich, variegated forest 

Near the centre of this plaui stands the ancient city of Ooroomiah, containing a popu- 
lation of about twenty thousand souls, mostly Mohammedans, and enclosed by a fosse 
and wall of nearly four miles in circuit At a little distance, on the east of the city, an 
ancient artificial mound rises to the height of seventy or eighty feet, and marks the 
site, as it is said, of the ancient shrine or temple, where, in days of yore, the renowned 
Zoroaster kindled bis sacred fires, and bowed in adoration to the heavenly hosts. 

The climate is naturally very delightful; but, owing to local causes, a poiscmous 
miasma is generated, occasioning fevers and the various diseases of malaria, to which 
the unacclimated stranger is specially exposed ; and the mission families have suffered 
much firom this cause. 

As we approached the village of Ddree, after a toilsome ride of seven hours over die 



90 nGBBUu 

rouf^ monntaiii pasBOi) we wtK hailed by scfveral of Ae Mgrtntfam NoMriBiie firen dw 
independent district of Tiyary, who demanded who we were, what we wanted, wluJto 

Sinff, &o.; and the demand was repeated by each suocessiye party we passed, ttl 
laUy the cry seemed to issue bom the rery rocks over our head, ' Who are yen ? 
whence do you come ? what do you want? ' A cry so often repeated, in the deep Sfwmc 
gutturals of their stentorian Toices, was not a httie startling : and Ihen their bold bear- 
ing, and a certain fierceness of expression, and spirited action and intonation of Toiec, 
with the scrutinizing inquiry whether we were Catholics or bad men whom they nik^t 
rob, (as one inquired of our Nestorian guide) bereft my guide of the little course wt 
had sustained him thus far; and he manifested so much real alarm that I yielded to his 
earnest request, and dismissed him as soon as we reached the house of the bishop, who 
assured me that his presence was no longer desirable. 

The people soon satiffied themselves of my character and friendly intentions, and, 
finding that I spoke their language, seemed to regard me as one of their own people, 
and gathered around me in the most friendly manner, but without that familiar syco- 
phancy so common among the Christian subjects of Persian and Turkish dominion. 

The attentive old bishop took my hand and guided it to a plain stone cross which 
lay upon the altar, supposing I would manifest my veneration or devotional feelings, after 
their own custom, by pressing it to my lips. I must confess that there is something 
affecting in this simple outward expression, as practised by the Nestorians, who mingle 
with it none of the image worship, or the other corrupt observances of the Bxxnan 
Catholic Church. 

Iron mines, under the control of the Koordish chief, are wrought by the Nestoriaas 
near this place, and lead mines are numerous in the Nestorian country beyond. 

Duree is nominally subject to the Turkish government, and immediately responsible 
to the Koordish chiei of Berwer, a sub-chief of Amadieh. 

A high range of mountains still separated me from the proper country of the inde- 
pendent Nestorians. At Mosul I was strongly advisedv not to venture into their country 
until I should send, and obtain an escort from the patriarch ; but, after mature considera- 
tion and free consultation with tlie bishop, I resolved to proceed at once : for by this 
course I might gain the good-will of the Nestorians from the confidence I evinced in 
them, and also save eight or ten days' delay ; a consideration of some importance on the 
eve of winter among these lofty mountains. The bishop volunteered to send an intelli- 
gent young Nestorian with me, and two others went to bring back the mules firom 
Lezan, which is the first village of the independent tribe of Tiyary, the nearest and by 
far the most powerful of the mountain tribes. 

Thus equipped in native style, I set off on the 18th, at an early hour in the morning: 
and, after a toilsome ascent of an hour and a half, I found myself at the summit of the 
mountain, where a scene indescribably grand was spread out before me. The country 
of the independent Nestorians opened before my enraptured vision like a vast amphi- 
theatre of wild, precipitous mountains, broken with deep, dark-looking defiles and 
narrow glens, into few of which the eye could penetrate so far as to gain a distinct view 
of the cheerful, smiling villages which have long been the secure abodes of the maio 
body of the Nestorian Church. Here was the home of a hundred thousand Christians, 
around whom the arm of Omnipotence had reared the adamantine ramparts whose lofty, 
snow-capped summits seemed to blend with the skies in the distant horizon. 

The only person I had ever seen from this remote tribe was a young Nestorian, who 
came to me about a year before, entirely blind. He said he had never expected to see 
the light of day, till my name had reached his country, and he had been told that 1 
could restore his sight. With wonderful perseverance, he had gone from yillage to 
village, seeking some one to lead him by the hand, till, in the coiurse of five or six weeks, 
he had reached my residence at Ooroomiah, where I removed the cataract from his 
eyes, and he returned to his mountains seeing. Scarcely had I^entered the first village 
in his country, when this young man, hearing of my approach, came with a smiling 
countenance, bearing in his hand a present of honey, in token of his gratitude for the 
restoration of his sight, and affording me an introduction to the confidence and affections 
of his people. 

I was invited to the residence of the chief man of the village, whose house was built, 
after the common style of the country, of stone laid in mud, with flat terrace roof; 
baving a basennent and second story, vriih two or three apartments in each. We were

gaeed before ns in a very large wooden bowl, placed upon the skin of a wild goat or 
ex, which was spread upon the carpet, with the hair side down, and served as a table 
und cloth. Bread made of millet, baked in the manner of the Virginia hoecake, but n<yt 
90 palatable, was laid round the edge of our goatskin table, and a large wooden spoon 
pfovided for each one of the party, eight or fen in number, to help himself out of the 
Â«omnK)n dish. The people here less generally eat with their fin^rs than do those ei 
â€¢Ptersia. 

Whenever. the goatskin Was brought forward, I noticed that it contained the frag- 
thents of bread left at the previous meals, and iras told, on inquiry, that this singular 
custom was observed in obedience to our Saviour's injunction, * Gather up the fragments 
that nothing be lost,' and also that they might retain the blessing which had been pro*- 
Qounced by a priest upon fornier repasts ; because the service, being irt the ancient 
language, is only intelligible to the clergy, and cannot be properly performed by the laity. 

The women did not eat with the men, but, instead ot receiving what they left, as is 
Tery common in the East, a separate portion was reserved for the females, and, in aH 
respects, they were treated with more consideration, and regarded more as companions 
than in most Asiatic countries. 

Till evening they were constantly occupied in their various employments, within or 
out of the house, and in many respects remarkably exemplified Solomon's description of 
a virtuous woman, even in their method of spinning (Prov. xxxi. 19,) literally holding 
their distaffs in their hands, while they give their long wooden spindles a twirl with the 
other hand, and then lay hold of it to wind up their thread; for they use no wheel. 
*rhey clothe their household in scarlet or striped cloth, made of wool and resembling 
Scotch tartan, of a beautiful and substantial texture. 

The women appear to be neat, industrious, and frugal, and they are remarkably 
chaste, without the false affectation of modesty too often seen in these countries. Two 
of the young married women in the house came forward in the evening, and, in the 
presence of their husbands, joined in onr social visit. Each of them, at my request, 
gave me a brass ring from her wrist to show to our American ladies, regarding whose 
customs they made many inquiries. Like others of their people, they were the most 
surprised that our ladies should negotiate their own matrimonial engagements, and that 
their fathers should give them in marriage without receiving a dowry in payment for 
their daughters. Their dress is neat and becoming; they braid their hair, and wear but 
few ornaments. Their form is graceful, their expression agreeable, and their complexion 
(except that it is sometimes affected by more exposure to the sun and the smoke of their 
dwellings) as fair as that of most Europeans. 

Grapes, figs, and pomegranates, I found among their fruits in the lower villages on 
the river, where rice is also cultivated, to the great detrimput of health. Apples and 
other Northern fruits are found in the higher villages. Wheat is little cultivated for want 
of space, but it is brought from Amadieh in exchange for honey and butter. 

Oct, 20. â€” Sabbath. A thin piece of board was struck rapidly with a mallet, to call 
the villagers to church at the rising of the stm. Each person, on entering the church, 
put off his shoes, and testified his reverence for the sanctuary of God by kissing the 
doorposts or threshold, and passed on to kiss the Gospels, lying upon the altar, then the 
cross, and finally the hand of his religious teacher. 

The church, like all I saw in the mountains, was a very solid stone edifice, with 
arched roof, and might stand for ages. Others that I saw had stood for more than fourteen 
centuries, according to their ancient records. For the narrow door (which would not 
admit a man without much stooping) the usual explanation was given, 'Strait is the 
gate,' &c., a truth of wbich they wished to be reminded when entering the sanctuary. 
The prayers and the singing or chanting of the psalms were all in the ancient Syriac 
language, and quite unintelligible to the common people ; but one of the priests read a 
portion of the Gospels, and gave the translation into the vulgar Syriac spoken by the 
Nestorians ; and this constituted the preaching. Sometimes the reaaing is accompanied 
by some explanations or legendary stories, of which they have many. 

It was a sacramental occasion ; and the bread and wine were consecrated in the 
sanctuary or 'holy place' of the church, and then brought out by a priest and a dea- 
con, while each member of the church went forward in rotation, and partook of a small

cles from falling as he put the morsel into the mouth of the commuuicaot ; and then hi 
drank of the wine, which was held with great care by the deacon, so that not a istf 
should be spilled. But there was none of that idolatrous adoratiim of the host, so ds- 
acteristic of the mass of the Romanists and of the other Oriental churches. On tha^oi- 
trary, there was almost a scriptural simplicity in the observance of this solemn ordinaaoe. 

There was great stillness and propriety of deportment in the congregaticm, and il 
retired without noise or confusion. In passing out, each person received at the doti, t 
rery thin leaf of bread, rolled together, and enclosing a morsel of meat This was dÂ« 
4oye feast' of the early Christians of the first and second centuries.* 

Several of the people then went to the house of the church-steward, and partook oft 
more substantial but plain repast, retiring soon after to their houses, or calling upon tbdr 
more immediate friends. The day was observed with far more propriety than I baft 
seen among other Christians of the East There was a general stillness througfaoat tbe 
village, such as I have noticed in few places in more highly-favored lands. There vu 
no noisy merriment, no attention to secular business : and the social intercourse of die 
people was nothing more than what was practised in the ancient Hebrew CbuisL 
Formerly they are said to have regarded the Christian Sabbath with so much sacredaaB^ 
as to put to death persons for travelling on that holy day. 

Those Nestorians who live imder the government of the Koords, occasionally seek 
relief from rapine and oppression, and their consequent poverty, among their bretfaieofif 
the plain. The heads oi some of the Nestorian tribes collect a small sum as a prraotf 
for tne independent Hakary chief; but they profess to regard it only as a present, aod 
they regulate their own civil aflfairs. 

Their form of church government is essentially episcopal ; but, with a single exc^ 
tion in the Jelu tribe, there is not a bishop among the independent Nestorians, wfacte 
their religious forms have been preserved the most exempt from any foreign inJSueiioe. 
It was a singular fact, to which my attention was first called by the testimony of Ik 
Buchanan, that there is not a word in the Syriac language expressive of the office of 
bishop. The Nestorians, in common with the other Syrians, have borrowed the Greek 
term episcopos. This is the more remarkable, considering the fact that the Syriac lan- 
guage was extensively used in Palestine in the days of our Saviour, and was spokoi ^1 
our Lord himself; and considering also the very early date of the Syriac version of tiÂ» 
Scriptures, as early as the beginning of the second centtiry. In every case where the 
term bishop occurs in our version, in theirs it is rendered presbyter or priest I make 
these statements with the single remark that, while this form of church government 
may be the best for the Nestorians in their circumstances, there is enough in the facts I 
have mentioned to caution us about too hasty an inference concerning the apostolic 
origin of episcopacy, on the ground that it exists in a church which was founded by the 
apostles. 

The tradition of the Hebrew origin of the Nestorians is general, and universally be- 
lieved \yj the Nestorians throughout Assyria and Media. They speak of it of their ova 
accord, m all places and in various circumstances. Smith and Dwight, in the course of 
their short visit to the Nestorian Christians^ were struck by their singular assertion that 
they were the descendants of the ten tribes.f They recognise the tact in conversation 
with each other, sis well as with strangers. One of their priests charged upon his peo- 
ple their accumulated guilt and responsibility, on the ground of their relation to those 
' to whom pertained the covenant and promises ;' and his language was that of rebuke, 
and not ot complaisance. Often have I heard the remark from their ecclesiastics, in 
allusion to their Hebrew ancestry, that theirs were a stiff-necked people, like their 
fathers of old. These incidental allusions to their Jewish ancestry prove most condii- 
sively that their tradition is received as a well-known truth. Though it suhjecMiim \o 
renroach, no one denies that he is of the chiMren of Israel. The learned and ignorant, 
old and young, all acknowledge the relation. 

The hatred existing between the Nestorians and the Jews forbids the idea of the fidtn^ 
cation of the tradition. What motive could lead them to claim affinity with their most 
implacable enemies ? Is it credible that an unfounded tradition of this kind, connectiB| 
them with a people with whom they will not even eat bread, would have been nniver- 

* Mosheim's Eod. Hist., vol. i. p. 54. f See Researches in Armenia, vot tL 



PERSIA. 225 

nfly received among all tfae various Nestorian tribes ? By whom, and in ^hat stage of 
tiiieir history, could it have been forced upon them ? Would there have been no dissent- 
ing voice among a widely-extended people? Here, as everywhere, the Jews are the 
most despised and persecuted class of the people. An odium is consequently attached to 
all who are allied to them. For fear of this odium, I have seen Nestorians hesitate ti> 

5ive a reply when interrogated respecting their ancestry ; yet they finally admitted thdr 
ewish origin. 

Their ignorance of prophecy forbids the idea that the tradition originated with theit 
religious teachers, in view of the great temporal blessings promised to the Jews. They 
have no anticipations of such blessings for the Israelites in particular. They believe in 
the final triumph of Christianity in the world, but in this they claim for themselves no 
pre-eminence over other Christians. They read the prophets little, and understand 
them less. Their interpretation of the prophetical writings is generally mystical and 
confused. 

The secluded situation of the great body of the Nestorians almost precludes the pos- 
sibility of their having received the idea of a Hebrew ancestry from the neighboring 
nations. They chiefly inhabit almost inaccessible mountains, where they are remarkably 
shut out from extraneous influence. Strangers have seldom or never entered their moun- 
tain fastnesses, and I know of no people who have so little intercourse with those 
around them ; moreover, if their neighbors had ranked them with the Jews, would not 
they have repelled the idea of such a connection? Is it credible that they would have 
received it as the basis of a general tradition? Or, were it possible that such a fabrica- 
tion could be palmed upon them in one place, how were they to induce their distant 
brethren to admit the imposture? and that, when every feeling would revolt at the idea 
of such a conne6tion. 

The Nestorians have also another tradition which adds not a little to the testimony. 
It is, that their forefathers, at some early day, came to the region now occupied by them 
from the land of PcUesHne. Precisely in what period of the world this occurred they do 
not know, though they are sure of its truth. That it was before the Christian era will 
appear evident, when we come to examine the history of their conversion to Christianity, 
what people besides the captive Israelites have ever been carried away from Palestine to 
Assyria and the cities of the Medes? That the ten tribes. were placed on the very 
ground now inhabited by the Nestorian Christians, we shall endeavor to show in the 
ensuing chapter. That fact, when fairly exhibited, will give great importance to this 
tradition, adding the jcharacter of direct testimony to what would otherwise be only cir- 
cumstantial. It will, at least, aflbrd a strong confirmation of our main position. But, 
direct and positive as is the testimony of the Nestorians themselves respecting their He- 
brew ancestry, we need not rest so important a question on their testimony alone. W^ 
shall now bring forward witnesses whose competency none will dispute, and whose 
testimony is no less unequivocal and positive than that of the Nestorians themselves. 

The Jews who dwell among them acknowledge the relationship. They admit that 
the Nestorians are as truly the descendants of the Israelites as themselves. Do they not 
know ? or is it possible that the great mass of the ten tribes were converted to Christianity 
without their knowledge? Providentially for our cause, the ten tribes are not all nomi- 
nally Christians. A remnant seem to have been left as witnesses in the case. Dispersed 
through the country of the Nestorians, and surrounding them on every side, are some 
thousands of nominal Jews, still adhering to Judaism, who claim to be a pi^t of the ten 
tribes carried kway captive by the kings of Assyria. These are the witnesses now on 
the stand. They testiiy, though sometimes reluctantly, that they and the Nestorians are 
brethren of the same stock ; that they and the Nestorians have a common relation to the 
house of Israel, a common origin. 

In Adiabene proper there are, at this day, nearly a hundred thousand Nestorians. 
while only a small remnant of Jews can be ^und among them. What have become oi 
the latter? how came the former in their place? In Media there are about twenty 
thousand Nestorians, and but only a tithe of that number of Jews. The number of 
Nestorians on the northwest side of the Habor is not known. They are represented as 
numerous. This appears probable from the fact, that, about four years ago, three Nes- 
torian bishops visited the patriarch from that region. Colonel Sheil, who passed near 
tfmr country, represents them as numerous.*' On the the opposite banks of the Habcv

were formerly even more nomerous than at present In the region of the Haboi, a In 
portion of the ten tribes appear to have remained anc<Hiverted to Christiamtf duM 
any other place. Still their number is inconsiderable ; peifaaps not more than five aum 
hundred households. But it is remarkable that the greater part of these reside mik 
BabaTj or, rather, on an island in that river, in the ancient town of Z^acho. , 

The Nestorian population in Media and Assyria, including a small portioa who but i 
embraced the tenets of Rome, may not be far from two hundred thousand, whik tk | 
nominal Jews in the same territory probably do not exceed twenty thousazid souk. Si j 
one will suppose that twenty thous^md individuals are all that remain of the ten tdim. 
It is not unlikely that the existing remnant of the ten tribes exceeds the estimate m 
have giv^i of the Nestorian population, as small parties may have gone to more distal 
regions. But, on account oi the great obstacles which hinder their emigration, tbw 
detached parties are probably smaU. It may be that future inquiries will idsitify ik 
Yezidees on the west of the Tigris with the ten tribes. There are also on the bvder 
of Assyria from twenty to forty thousand Syrian Christians, who have many traits k 
common with the Nestorians. Should it hereafter be found that they have the sarac 
Jewish characteristics, the evidence of their Hebrew origin will be strong. But get 
present inquiries relate to the Nestorkms. 

While the whole region of country to which the ten tribes were transplanted k aov 
more or less occupied by the Nestorian Christians, it is worthy of particular notice, tbn 
the most central parts of thk region are, and have been from time imn^^norial, ei^^b 
inhabited by the Nestorians, to the exclusion of every other class of people. A am j 
part of the independent tribe of Tiyary, and the whole of the tribes ot Tehoma, fias, * 
Jelu, Diss, and other minor tribes, are included in the boundaries of -Adiabene, vbee 
the great body of the ten tribes were in the first century of the Christian era. Tbsj 
are either the captive Israelites, or they have entirely usurped their place. 

I have already remarked that a small portion df the descendants of the ten tiiki. 
by a special Providence, appear to have been reserved, unconverted from Judaism, Â« ^ 
witnesses to the identity of dieir converted brethren. We have heard their direct tesft- i 
mony that the Nestorians have a common ancestry with themselves. They have also i ' 
common language. Not.that the Nestorians speak a dialect of the Hebrew ; for they do 
not. The Jews living in the places to which the ten tribes were transplanted, speak a 
different language from their brethren in other parts of the world. It is a diak>ct of tke 
Syriac, which indicates for them a different ancestry. This is also the language spc^cfi 
by the Nestorians. They are radically the same. The Nestorians themselves testify to 
this, and say there is little or no more difference between the language of their Jewyt 
neigbb<urs and their own, than there is between the several dialects spoken among them- 
selves. Of this I am satisfied, after extensive observation in all parts of their country. 
I have seen Nestorians from Ooroomiah converse with Jews at Ainadieh, without know- 
ing fiN>m their language that they were Jews; and I can now converse with the Jews (d 
Ooroomiah in their own dialect with about the same ease that I can with some of the 
mountain tribes of Nestorians in theirs. Other members of this mission have noticed 
the striking similarity of the dialects spoken by the Jews and Nestorians of Ooroomiah; 
and it is worthy of remark, that one of them, on first conversing with a Jew in his own 
native Syriac, supposed that the Jew had been learning the language of the Nestorians 
for the sakf of obtaining their custom in trade. The following testimony to the idoititj 
of the language spoken by the Nestorians and Jews of Ooroomiah, is given by the Ber. 
A. L. Hollody, wnose judgment in the case no one will question, when it is known that, 
after being for some time a professor of languages in one of the American colleges, be 
has prepared a grammar of the modern Syriac, the medium of communication which In 
has used in his intercourse with both Jews and Nestorians. ' The language of tfie NeÂ»- 
toriaas of OiMroomiah differs so little,' he remarks, 'from that of the Jews in the sane 
city, that I can consider it only as a dialect of the same. This langusige, and the da- 
lecAs whioh I have heard spoken by individuals belonging to several <h the nKXitttaiB 
tribes ef Nestorians, had evidently a common origin.' 

The-ttse of the Syriac language by both the Nestorians and Jews of this ragioB u 
an impovtaBt iact, evincing that Siey are both alike aliens from the same country. In 
support of tlus opinion, we may addooe the tradition of the Nest^iaas which w^ hsve

mentioned, that tbeir totetkihBve came feun the land of Palestine, a3 did the Jevs of 
course. 

But our main argument will be found in the position of the ten tribes in relation \q 
the surrounding nations. When the ten tribes revolted from Judah, their kings, as we 
have seen, spared no effort to make them a distinct people from the other Hebrews. I^ 
to perpetuate the breach between the two nations, they were ready, in the face of the 
most signal warnings, to lead the Israehtes into idolatry, would they, as the means of 
securing the same end, hesitate to encourage among them the use of a different lan- 
guage ? Connected as they were with Uie Syrians, they would most naturally acauire 
their language. That they so early adopted the strange gods and idolatrous rites of the 
Syrians, is difficult to explain on any other supposition than their having a common me- 
dium of communication. This is also evinced by their becoming confederates with the 
Syrians in their wars against Judah. But no circumstance more conclusively shows 
the almost necessary introduction of the Syrian tongue among the Israelites, than the 
fact that they were so completely subjugated by the Syrians. For a whole generation 
or more, the Syrians oppressed and wasted them till they ' had made them like the dust 
by threshing.' After the death of Hazael, king of Syria, who was raised up as a special 
scourge to Israel, and who oppressed them for more than twenty years, the Israelites 
gained some advantages over their Syrian masters ; but it was not till several years 
later that they finally threw off the Syrian yoke. The ten tribes had become reduc^ 
to such straits by their cruel servitude to the Syrians, as to call forth the interposition 
of God in their behalf: * For the Lord saw the affliction of Israel that it was very bitter : 
for there was not any shut up, nor any left, nor any helper for Israel. And Uie Lord 
said not that he would blot out the name of Israel from under heaven; but he saved 
them by the hand of Jeroboam, the son of Joash.'* 

How can we be at a loss, after their forty years' servitude to the Svrians, and the^r 
civil and religious intercourse with them for two and a half centuries, uom the revolt to 
their captivity? It is not difficult, then, to account for the fact, that the ten tribes^ before 
their captivity, spake the Syriac language. If it be objected that a conquered nation 
would be slow to adopt the language of their oppressors, I appeal to the history of thoae 
countries where such changes frequently occur. Where the people, influenced by reli- 
gious prejudice or other reasons, have shown a repugnance to make the change, they 
have, m some instances, been compelled to do it by severe inflictions. This was true oi 
many of the Greeks of Asia Minor. At the point of the sword they have been made to 
exchange their classic language for that of their Mohammedan foes. And in Palestine 
itself, the Arabic has taken the place of the Syriac, as that did of the Hebrew. 

The close affinity between the Hebrew and Syriac, I need scarcely remark, rendered 
the change peculiarly easy to the people of Israel. Consequently, it may have been 
effected almost imperceptibly to themselves, as one generation succeeded the other during 
their subjection to the Syrian kings ; or rather, I might say, during the two hundred and 
fifty years of their religious and national intercourse. And if, as we have supposed, the 
change was encouraged by the policy of their kings, to strengtl^en the wall ot separation 
between Israel and Judah, it is almost inevitable that the ten tribes should have acquir- 
ed the Syriac language. Now, add to all this circumstantial proof the fact that the 
Jews, dwelling in the regions to which the ten tribes were carriea captive, do to this day 
speak the Syriac language (a language used by no other portion of the Jews of whom 
we have any knowledge,) and the conclusion cannot be avoided, that their ancestors 
obtained that knowledge before their captivity. It appears then, from their language as 
well as other testimony, that the Jews now living in ' Halah and Habor, by the river of 
Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes,' are descendants of the ten tribes ; and that they 
spoke the Syriac tongue at the time they were deported to these places. The nimiber 
of the Jews still professing Judaism, however, is altogether too small to allow of the 
supposition that they are the only representatives of Israel, to whom such prominence 
is given in the unaccomplished predictions of the inspired Prophets. Still they are suf- 
ficienty numerous to be important witnesses to the identity of the Nestorians with the 
lost tribes. 

As far as a common language can in any drcnmstances identify one pe<^ with 
anotfier, $6 far die language of the Nestorians proves their Israelitish mgin.

238 PERSIA. 

Beni Israel is used generally to designate the lineal origin of the Nestorians. Ask 
any intelligent Nestorian for information relating to his ancestry, and he replies at oneei 
"We are sons of Israel." It is a term familiar to all^' and we might, with as mucb 
propriety, deny them the name of Christians, as to refuse our assent to this more ancient 
appellation, since they lay claim alike to both, while their rites and customs and otfier 
circumstances furnish nearly as satisfactory testimony in the one case as in the other. 
But, while they assert an inaUenable right to this name, so significant of their Hebrew 
origin, still, as their specific character as Jews has merged in the one they now bear as 
Christians, and as their national character is in a manner lost in their long captiyity, 
they now more commonly apply to themselves another name. The name Beni Jsradj 
however, is not unfrequently used by the Nestoriafis ; nor is this the first time it has 
been brought before the public. It is distinctly mentioned by writers upon Persian 
Christians as evidence of their relation to the Jewish Church.* 

Nazareans is a term very commonly employed by themselves and others to designatt 
the Nestorians.f I( is specific in its application to the Nestorians, and is never applied 
to the Armenians or other Christian sects. As evidence of their Hebrew (Uigin, it 
may be, in some respects, even more satisfactory than the expressive appeUaticm, ^sons 
of Israel.' 

Nestorian is a name disliked by the people thus designated. They rarely apply it 
to themselves, and they are averse to its application by others, lest, as it seems, they 
should be thought to participate in the reputed heresy of Nestorius, a bishop of Constan- 
tinople, who was excommunicated from the general church, A. D. 431. But the reason 
which they assign for objecting to the use of this name is, that they never derived either 
their doctrines or their rites from Nestorius. They reverence him for raising his roioe 
against the worship of images, and against the prevalent use of the title Mother of God; 
which, as they affirm, virtually takes away the humanity of our Saviour, and thus 
leaves us without a Mediator. But having themselves never applied any other titk 
than Mother of Christ to the Virgin Mary, and their worship never having been polluted 
with images ;| while, at the same time, they have ever held to the human and Divine 
nature in one person in Christ, they ask, where is the propriety of calling their ancient 
church after a bishop who lived in comparatively a late day, and with whom they never 
had any connection ? It is true, they espoused his cause as the cause of an injured 
man, whom they regarded as a faithful servant of the Lord Jesus, persecuted for righte- 
ousness' sake ; and on this account the enemies of Nestorius endeavored to fasten reproach 
upon them by calling them after his name. 

Throughout ProtiBStant Christendom, however, the name of Nestorian is justly b<m- 
ored; and there seems to be no good reason for discarding it at this late day, established 
as it is by long conventional usage, and interwoven with the history of the church and 
the world. 

That the converted Jews continued to observe the ceremonial law, as far as was 
compatible with their profession of Christianity, there is abundant proof in history; 
while the evidence is e({uaily clear that these onerous rites were never imposed upon the 
Gentile converts. || Hence the observance, by the Nestorian Christians, of the pecuUar 
rites and customs of the Jews, furnishes very strong evidence of their Hebrew origin. 
So peculiar were the demands of the Mosaic ritual on many points, that there is no 
possibility of their adoption and perpetuation by mere accident or casual coincidence. 
If some of these rites, as in the case of sacrifices, were practised by other nations, yet 
there were collateral observances, connected with them by the Jews, so unique in th&t 
character as to leave no room for mistake. Some of the Jewish rites, being obviously 
inconipatible with Christianity, must not be looked for among the converts from Judaism. 
But if the reason for their discontinuance, in particular cases, can be clearly indicated, 
the evidence, as a whole, will not be essentially diminished. Let us look at the appli* 
cation of this principle in relation to sticrifices. That Christ has offered hima^ a 
sacrifice to atone for the sins of his people ; that we are sanctified through the offiering 
of the body of Jesus Christ, once for ail, is the foundation of the Christian's hope ; coo-

M^aently, il is dear that it would be a virtual denial of Christ as ^^ the pn^pUiatian far 
omr ^tnt," to continue to offer the atoning sacrifice or sin-offering of the Levitical code. 
But the Jewish ritual prescribed other sacrifices, which were in no way connected with 
the atonement If, therefore, we find a body of Christians continuing to offer these sac- 
rifices after the manner of the Mosaic ritual, is it not probable that they would have 
retained the other also, had it not been abrogated by the death of Christ? And would 
BOt their continued observance of the only sacrifices compatible with their profession of 
Christianity, afford as satisfactory evidence !n favor of their Jewish origm as though 
they observed them both ? 

This is just the case with the Nestorian Christians. While they acknowledse Christ 
ac the final offsriog for sin, they continue to present the other form of sacrilce â€” the 
peaoe-offerings â€” ^in accordance with the customs of the Jews. 

' The peace-offering,' says Cruden, ' was offered ' to return thanks to God for his 
benefits^ or to ask favors finnn him, or to satisfy any one's private devotion, or for the 
honor of God only. The Israelites offered them when they pleased, and there was no 
law that obliged them to do it It was firee to them to present what animals they would, 
furovided they were such as it was allowed them to sacrifice. In these sacrifices no dis* 
tinction was made, either of the age or sex of the victim, as was required in the bumi 
9aerifioes and sacrifice for sin ; the law only required that their victim should be without 
blanLdL Lev. xxxi. He that presented them came to the door of the tabernacle, put 
his hand upon the head of his victim, and killed it. The breast and the right shoulder 
belonged to the priest that performed the service; all the rest of the sacrifice belonged 
to him that presented it, and he might eat it with his family and friends as any other 
meat.'* But it must be eaten on the first or second day. Lev. vii. 16. 

No general description could better answer to the sacrifices! of the Nestorians, both 
as regards their object and the manner of performing them. They are usually offered 
to return thanks for God's benefits, or to obtain new favors from him ; as, for instance, 
the recovery of sick friends, or their own restoration to health. The animal is then 
usually slain before the door of the church, when a little of the blood is often put upon 
the door or lintels. The right shoulder and breast belong to the officiating priest of the 
church ; though he does not always receive them, either through neglect oi the person 
who offers the sacrifice, or, as some of the priests informed me, from a wish to avoid 
{^lowing the wicked example of Eli's sons, who made the sacrifices of the Temple an 
ocoasion of selfish gratification. Few, however, refuse their portion on this account 
The skin is also given to the priest, as was required in the bumt^fferings. Lev. vii. 8. 

As all who are present may partake of the sacrifice, it is sometimes spoken of as a 
charitable offering; but it is often eaten by the person who offers it, together with his 
more immediate friends. It is regarded by all as an offering acceptable to God. Ip 
some cases the animal is slain before the door of the offerer, and a portion is sent to 
â€¢very house in the village ; but this is usually in fulfilment of particular vows to that 
effect The sacrifice is generally all eaten the same day it is killed ; but I saw an 
instance at the house of the patriarch, in which it was not consumed till the evening of 
the second day, when they said it was necessary that it should all be eaten. The custom 
of sprinkling the blood upon the altar, and of burning a part of the victim, is not strictly 
observed by this people ; but it is also omitted by the Jews of Goroomiah and of other 
countries. 

The Nestorians regard these sacrifices as a remnant of their former Jewish rites* 
and those Jews, of whom I have inquired on the subject, say that ' they are a part oi 
their own rites, which the Nestorians have retained since their conversion from Judaism, 
vhile they have departed from the law in more important matters.' The Nestorians 
sonetimes offer sacrifices on the death of distinguished persons, supporting the practice 

3^ rdference to 2 Maccabees xii. 43, as they do their other sacrifices by reference to the 
osaic ritual and the practice of their forefathers. 

First-fruits are to this dav presented to the Lord by the Independent Nestorians, as 
they were among the Jews of old. The first ripe fruits of their fields, gardens, and vine- 
yards are presented to God before the harvest is gathered; and, as their flocks comprise 
their chiei wealth, they also set apart the first-fruits of the dairy as an offering to the

the milk of the whole flock is set apart for the support of the services of Ae saadatfi, 
or to feed the poor. Either in the form of milk, butter, or cheese, as suits the efim. fi 
is carried to the most central and principal church, and given for the service of te 
tiord. Several large schools are said to have been supported by these first-fiiBts ni 
tithes, in former years. But now they are consumed by attendants and visiters at lb 
diurch, or at public festivals. In other pirts of the Nestorian country the fitst-finb 
have ceased to be offered, owing, as it is said, to poverty and oppresition. In Ttyiiy fe 
practice is said to be general, though it may not be universal. 

Tithes have ceased, as it is said, for the same reason ; nor would tfaeif ezisteoce k 
satisfactory testimony in the case, as they have been introduced among many odier 
branches of the church. But the offering of first-fruits to the Lord is believea to k 
a practice so peculiar as to be identified at once as a remnant of Judaism. 

The Sabbath is regarded with a sacredness among the mountain tribes wMch Ihift 
seen among no other Christians in the East. I have repeatedly been told'byNcjte. 
rians of the plain, that their brethren in the mountains would immediately Inil a ma 
for travelling or laboring upon the Christian Sabbath ; and there is abundant testimovf 
to prove that this was formerly done, though it has ceased since the people have beeotti 
acquainted with the practice of Christendom on this subject. 

While in the mountains I made repeated inquiries concerning the observance rfthl 
remarkable statute of the Jews, which required that 'whosoever doeth any woiltt 
the Sabbath-day, he shall surely be put to death ;^ and I was eve ry where tbtd llittte 
statute had formerly been literally executed. Nor does there appear to be asy flaodn 
for deception^ since the practice is now disapproved of by all. There are said Id h 
Nestorians in Tiyary who will not kindle a nre upon the Sabbath ia cook their ibod: 
out their cold winters oblige them to do it for the sake of hecessary warmth. On Ae 
plain there is much desecration of the Lord's day; but can the execution of the Monk 
ritual regarding the Sabbath, by the independent Nestorians, be accounted for in any 
other way than as a remnant of Judaism T Where, except among God's ancient people, 
to whom this peculiar law was immediately promulged, can we find a parallel caset 

The Nestorians have also the ^preparation before the Sabiath,^ commencing dwt 
three hours before sunset on Saturday, when all labor should cease except what ii 
necessary to prepare for spending a quiet Sabbath.* But the rule has in a meBsm 
rallen into disuse. 

The Sanctuary, or holy place of the Temple, was guarded among the JeWB wi4 
no less strictness than the sacredness of the Sabbath ; and the sanctuary of (he chmdi 
is regarded with much the same reverence by the Nestorian Christians. In sprakingrf 
the Nestorian churches, the Rev. Eli Smith remarks : * I observed ttiat a door cottdnoCed 
into the sanctuary, and was about to enter. But the bishop commanded me, in aa 
authoritative tone, to stop. I told him that I too was a priest; but he relied Att thst 
place can only be entered by fasting, and betrayed by his manner, sudb an eMnestoesi 
Chat I desisted.'f None but the consecrated ecclesiastics can enter this holy place; lod 
they must not only abstain from all food and drink from the previous day, bat dso frn 
sources of uncleanness mentioned in the ceremonial laT^, particularly from that fi)rMdeQ 
by Moses (Exod. xix. 15) when he sanctified the people preparatory to his entering into 
the presence of God on Mount Sinai. Great care is taken to secure the holypbce 
against the entrance of any unclean person or animal. 

When the sanctuary has been polluted by the enttane^e of any utihallowed powa, it 
must be consecrated anew before it can be used for the service of Gkni. Daring to 
interval we have been permitted to enter this * holy place ' of the Nestorian chawhe, 
but under no other circumstances. Not along ago a bishop tras called to oonaeenle 
anew the sanctuary of the church in Ooroomiah, which had been entered by unhaBoved 
feet in the night 

The 'Holy of Holies' still exists among the Nestorians. A small recess in the 
wall of their church is called by that name. Christ having entered into Ae most hdy 
place *once for all,' a figure of the cross is kept there, and no one enters. ^^Â®[P^ 
of their churches bear the names of corresponding parts of the Jewish Temple. IW 
is no parallel to this state of feeling among the omer Christians of the East I ba^

Mpeatsdiy entered the sanetuary of the Anneoian, Qreek, and Jacobite Sjnrian ohoiches, 
and that in the presence of their ecclesiastics, who made no objection. Whence is this 
difierence of sentiment ? 

In the emutrudion of their churches, the Nestorians attach much greater importance 
Atan the other Christians^ to the sanctuary, making it about half the size of the main 
body of the bburch or ^/empfe,' (hekla,) as they call the place of general congregation. 
The Nestorians, also, have much the same feeling of strong attachment for their ancient 
churches that the Jews had for their T^oaple. I have frequently seen them go out of 
the way to pay them some mark of reverence ; and when I inquired of some of the 
mountaineers how it was- that they had so long preserved their independence, surrounded 
by enemies on every side, their reply was, *Our churches have saved us.'* Their 
churches, as well as the sanctuary, may not be entered by persons contaminated by any 
^ the ceremonial pollutions of the Levitical code. This singular fact needs no comment ; 
bat the mention of it naturally leads to the consideration of some of the peculiar Jewish 
Mntiments or regulations to which allusion is here made. 

Swings Jleah and other meats prohibited by the Levitical code, are here regarded by 
many of the Nestorians with little less abhorrence than they were by the Jews ; thougn 
intefcourse with other Christians is said to have effected quite a change in the sentiments 
of some on this subject In the mountains the change is less felt than in Ooroomiah \ 
and, though wild hogs are frequently killed, very few, if any, eat of their flesh. While 
I was with the patriarch, the change of sentiment on this subject was mentioned more 
than once as the effect of foreign iMuence. The innovatioilis said to have been very 
recent, as it is also felt only to a limited extent We have the testimony of their most 
inteihgent men, that formerly their people would not so much as touch, and much less 
eat the flesh of swine, or other animals regarded as unclean by the ceremonial law. It is 
one of the accusations which the Nestorians bring against some of their Christian neigh- 
bors, that they eat unclean, or forbidden food. Those who take a more liberal view of 
Ike subject, feeling it necessary to justify their conduct in the eyes of their opposing 
brethr^A, quote the words of Christ : ' Not that which goeth into the mouth demeth a 
man ;' and also the command of God to Peter, to ' kill and eat ' of animals that were 
before regarded as unclean. Acts x. 10 â€” 16. The fact that the Moslems observe the 
same distinction respecting clean and unclean food, is no argument against our views; 
fyt it is well known that Mohammed borrowed many things from the Israelites. Now, 
as these specific regulations are confined to the Jewish and Moslem codes, the Nestorians 
must have derived them from the one or the other; and, as we have seen that they have 
many customs quite peculiar to the former, while they clearly are not descendants 
of the latter, is it not most rational to believe that their sentiments regarding for- 
bidden food are also a remnant of Judaism 1 Their appeal is not to the Koran, but 
to the Mosaic ritual. 

Their /<M/S9 andfesiwdU bear a close analogy to those of the ancient Jews. Like the 
Pharisees, they ' iast twice in a week,' and they attach great importance to these ob- 
aervances. These attachments the Nestorians themselves refer to a Hebrew origin. ^ In ' 
one instance,' says my friend Mr. Stocking, ^ while I was hearins the bishop and 
priests read the New Testament, the difference between the Jewish and Gentile convertS| 
arising from the strong attachment of the former to their Jewish customs, was alluded to j 
aikl one of the priests remarked to me that the analogy was quite similar between our* , 
selves. ^ We,' said he, ' were formerly Jews, and hold to our fasts ; but you are 
Gentile Christians, and do not wi^h to adopt our customs.' 

7%e Passover they observe as their principal festival. They call it Pascha^ after the 
original name of that ordinance as observed by the Jews. But the mode of the observ- 
ance is modified, by their faith in Christ Regarding Him as the final passover, they 
substitute the emblems of his body and blood for the Paschal Lamb. In other respects 
they keep the festival much after the manner of the ancient Hebrews ; and a Uke cor- 
respondence is observed throughout their fasts and festival occasions. 

Vircmndsumy say the Nestorians, has been superseded by baptism ; and they baptize 
dieir children on the eighth day, or at a subsequent period, but never before ; and the 
ordinance is usually, but not uniformly, performed by imtnersion. 

The physiognomy of the Nest(Â»rian Christians bears a close resemblance to that of the

Jevs of the country in which they dwell. Even the niitivee, who axe a e el ifciâ€” at li 

discriminate by the features between the various classes of people, are often unable li 
distinguish a Nestorian from a Jew ; and I have taxed my own powers of disci iminatMi 
with no better success. While Nestorians and Jews have been seated together bdae 
me, I have in vain endeavored to find some distinguishing mark between them in tbt 
features or general contour of the face. The Jews, being more op{Nre8sed, I bAwe semii 
times fancied, wore a deeper shade of care in their countenance, and, in some crises, Iks 
complexion may be very slightly affected by their closer confin^nent in their xneGbaat- 
cal and conunercial pursuits, while the Nestorians are more abroad with their flocks Â« 
in the fields. But this does not afford a criterion by which we can distinguish betvea 
them ; for, if a Jew has been exposed to the weather, we the more readily mistake him fm 
a Nestorian ; and so^ if the latter has been confined to the house, we confound him Â« 
readilv with a Jew. Other members of this mission, and one English gentleman vfai 
visited us, have noticed this striking resemblance, saying of this or that Nestorian, 'Be 
has the most marked Jewish physiognomy I ever saw.' On this subject my friend, te 
Rev. Mr. Homes, remarks : ' One of the first things which suggested itself to me ob 
seeing the Nestorians, was their peculiar. Jewish physiognomy.' 

Their names are ,as strikingly Israelitish as their physiognomy. I have seen picimis- 
cuous circles of ten or twelve Nestorians, in which every individual had a Jew^h name 
From forty-five members of our seminary who were taken promiscuously, thirty-tvo 
had Jewish names found in the Bible. Others had received names of significant impoft, 
in accordance with, the cusl^m of the Jews, and such as are common among those of 
Ooroomiah. 

Most of the Nestorian Christians, like the ancient Israelites, live in separate trite 
We do not deem it essential to our main position, and shall not attempt to identify eaA 
one of the tribes separately. ' The tribes of Israel,' says Dr. Buchanan, ^ are no longer 
to be inquired after by name. The purpose for which they were divided into tribes 
was accomplished when the genealogy of the Messiah was traced to the stem of David 
Neither do the Israelites themselves know certainly from what tribe they are descended.' 
In the prophecies yet to be fulfilled, except those contained in the last chapter of Ez&- 
kiel, the ten tribes are always spoken of collectively. As a body^ they are distinctly <ks- 
ignated by the names Israel and Ephraim ; and the rich blessings promised them in the 
word of God are to be received bv them as one people. We shall, therefore, content our- 
selves for the present if we can identify them as a whole. When ^ the lost sheep of ths 
house of Israel ' shall be gathered together in one fold, if the Great Shepherd has de- 
signs to accomplish by their separation into their respective enclosure a division wiU 
unquestionably be made. Still, the existence of the Nestorians, from time inunenaorial, 
in distinct tribes nearly or quite corresponding in ntunber to those of ancient Israel, is a 
remarkable fact, and may mmish interesting testimony with regard to theilr origin. If 
we are able to identify one of these divisions with any one of the ten tribes, the infiarence 
naturally follows that the other divisions represent the remaining tribes, especially u 
there is internal evidence of their common origin. 

As already intimated, few of the Nestorians can trace, either by tradition or otherwise, 
their lineal descent Some, with a degree of vanity, have claimed connecticm with the 
royal tribe, but have afterward acknowledged their ignorance on the subject* Others 
distinctly claim that they are the posterity of the ten tribes^ without attempting to trace 
their ancient divisions. But, in the midst of this general ignorance on the subject, the 
family of the patriarch, who of all others are the most likely to have preserved ccnrrect 
information regarding their genealogy, assure us most confidently that they know the 
particular tribe from which they are descended ; and they make the assertion with so much 
apparent integrity of purpose, and with such attendant circumstances, as leave us no 
rooqi to doubt their sincerity. 

They claim descent from Naphtali; a claim that certainly savors little of vanity. 
If the assertion be not founded in truth, why do they not claim affinity with the sacerdotal 
or royal tribes? What possible motive can they have for courting an alliance with the 
humble son of a handmaid ? The highest faftiily in the nation setting up an unfounded 
claim to a connection with the^ost humble, with one of the least distinguished of aM 
ancient tribes 1 With the pride of ancestry which especially characterii^s ever^

dbtii^imlMd Oriental,, there is a strong temptation for them to disavoixr this himible 
oonneetion altogether, and substitute for it one of more honorable name. The records 
cm which they mainly relied for proofs in the case, were, together with a large quantity 
of manuscripts, lost in conveying them across the Zab at high water about sixty years 
ago. But, as this occurred so recently, and during the lifetime of some now on the 
stage, there is little room for mistake in the case. Either the story must be altogether a 
fiibrication, at which all have connived, or it must be based upon proof which was satis- 
factory at least to t)K>8emost concerned. As there is no conceivable motive for attempt- 
ing such an imposition, we are left to the fair conclusion that the patriarch's family are 
what they profess to be, the descendants of the tribe of Naphtali. The other Nestorian 
tribes sustaming about the same relation to this and to each other that the Hebrew tribes 
x^atively held, it is natural to infer that they all had a common descent from the stock 
oÂ£ Israel, as their high-priest appears to have had from one of the ten tribes. This idea 
derives additional support from the circumstance, that their chiefs or nominal heads retain 
the Hebrew appellation Melek or McUek, which designated the royal head of the nation 
of Israel. This term, it is true, has found its way into other Oriental languages; but I 
know of no other people in the East with whom it is in common use, to designate their 
civil head, as it was among the Hebrews, and is now among the Nestorian s. 

There is also much in the government of the independent Nestorians which resembles 
that of the ancient Hebrews. Their maleks, it is true, have little more than the name 
of their office, and* the people are really "without a prince" or any civil head. Their 
form of government partakes much of the theocracy of^the ancient Jewish code, when ^ the 
high-priest was at the head of all religious aiSairs, and was the ordinary judge of aU 
difficulties that belonged thereto, and even of the general justice and judgment of the 
Jewish nation.'* 

This is just the relation sustained by the Nestorian patriarch to the independent tribes. 
He presides on important occasions in the judicial assembly of their elders *,f and he 
inflicts punishment for civil offences by the several forms of excision or excommunica- 
tion in use among the Jews ; cutting off the offender, not merely from the privileges of 
the church, but from civil society and all the rights of citizenship. His authority is only 
that which, as the anointed high-priest of his people, he derives from God. But its power 
is felt, as I had occasion to notice in the case of a man of some rank in Tiyara, who 
was cut off from all intercourse with the people, so that I was obliged to go a day's 
joomey out of my way to avoid communication with him. 

The AVBNOEE or blood among the independent Nestorians is the minister of justice ' 
for capital crimes, as was the case among the Hebrews. ' The execution of the pun- 
ishment which (in Gen. ix. 6,) was decreed against the homicide, devolved on the 
brother or other nearest relative of the person whose life had been taken away. In case 
he did not slay the guilty person, he was considered infamous.^ % T^is is just the state 
of things among the Assyrian tribes of Nestorians at this day. An indelible stain marks 
the character of the person who does not avenge the death of a relative; and, so strong 
is the force of this long-estabUshed custom, that even the precepts of the Gospel fail to 
overcome it. 

CiTiBS OP RBFUOB^ wcrc appointed by the Hebrew legislator to prevent abuses in tiiis 
summary manner of punishing the guilty. These cities were the property of the priests 
and Levites, and were required to be numerous and accessible. Among the Nestorians. 
the churches in most respects correspond to this description ; and they are the constituted 
eMes ofrefuge^ where the man-slayer may flee for security, and safely remain till the 
elders shall decide on his case. If then the man be found guilty of wilful homicide, he 
is delivered over to the avenger of blood to be put to death; if not wilful, a ransom is 
fixed by the judges, or the affair settied to the satisfaction of the avenger of blood, 
(Ex. xxi. 30,) and his life is spared. 

There are many other points in the civil policy of the Nestorians, upon which I need 
not dwell, that appear to be derived directly from the Mosaic law, which is, in fact, 
Uieir only civil code. It is their adherence to this code that forms the ground of evi- 
dence in support of their Hebrew origin ; and hence a semblance of the same practices* 
among other Orientals detracts very littie from the validity of this testimony. Let it be

flbown tiiat axtf otbet paopto no' rdaied to the Jews as really foUoir the piecqrta of th 
Mosaic law, and appeal to it as the basis of their civil jurisprudence, and we will admk 
that there may be nothing in the gOYemment of the independent Nestorians indicatiTB 
oÂ£ their Israelitish origin ; but, till then, we must regard these customs as afibrdisi 
strong circumstantial evidence in its favor. 

Ths sentiments and feelings of the Nestorians in respect to the Jews are a matta 
which requires more than a passing notice ; as very different conclusions may be drawi 
from it by different individuals, unless it be tracea to its proper source. When vievÂ«d 
in its true light, it bears testimony to their common origin. 

They are a peculiar people. The relation of the Nestorian Christians to the surromii- 
ing nations is in itself a circumstance of no little interest. But it assumes a magnifiad 
importance in this connection, both on account of the evidence furnished by the ^ u 
inaicative of their early ancestry, and as a proof that tbisy are to Uiis day a distinct aad 
unmixed race. Were there no evidence of this, it might be objected that, althou^ it ii 
clear that they have remains of Judaism and other evidence of a relati(m to Israel, y^ 
only a part of them may have a Hebrew origin. But their relative situation and thdi 
civil and religious policy, together with their peculiar character and lan^age, evina 
the futility of this objection. 

Their geographical position is remarkably adapted to their preservation as a distinct 
people. 1 speak now particularly of the main body of them in the recesses of almost 
maccessible mountains, where they are seldom visited by any other people. Thougk 
surrounded by Persians, Turks, Koords, Arabs, Armenians, Jews, and Yezidees, ttey 
have very little intercourse with either, and admit none into their comitry, except Â« 
particular business, and then only such as are well known, or who come with the saoc- 
tion of their chief men. Their secluded retreat is so walled around by adamantioe 
barriers, and is so easily defended, that their enemies have never been able to scale the? 
mountain ramparts ; so that they have remained for ages almost shut out from the woiU 
around them. Not only are the principal part of the Nestorians shut out by physical ba> 
riers from the people around them, but their civil condition requires them to reroaii 
peculiarly distinct. It is perhaps to this, as much as to the nature of their country, 
that they owe their present independence, in the midst of numerous and powerful aÂ»e- 
mies ; while, on the other hand, their seclusion and exclusive policy naturally repel any 
attempt on the part of others to form a connection with them. 

There is mucn in the social and domestic habits of the Nestorians so entirely similar 
to what we find among God's ancient people, that a particular account of them would 
differ but little from a correct transcript of Hebrew archaeology. Perhaps I cannot better 
introduce this part of my subject than by a short extract from the journal of the Rev. 
Mr. Perkins : *As I was at work in our little garden,' he writes, * the boys belonging to 
our school passed along and saluted me in their patriarchal style, by saying, ^'Allak 
covet yavil," "May God give you strength." It is deeply interesting to see how much 
there is that is truly primitive among the Nestorians. We meet with it m their house- 
hold furniture, in their agricultural utensils, in their instruments of music, but, most of 
all, in their modes of salutation. When two persons meet, they mutually salute each 
crther by saying, "Peace be with you;" and the other replies, "Your company is wd- 
oome." When a guest leaves a house, he says, "May God grant you increase, may 
your days be prosperous;" and the other replies, "May God be with you." When 
one puts on a new garment, enters a new house, or purchases a new article, his friend 
congratulates him by saying, " May God bless your garment," " May God bless your 
house," &X5. If you do a Nestorian a kindness, or wish him prosperity, he says, m 
thanking you, "May God give you the kingdom of Heaven." When one enters upon 
any undertaking, he says, " If the Lord will, I shall accomplish it ;" " In the strength of 
the Lord, I will leam this book," ' &c. 

T^h^ forms of their salutations, I may add, are no less primitive than the phraseology 




weeping tor joy on the return ot long 
Their hospitaKhf* to the stranger, and especially to their own people, is quite as prim- 
itive as the salutation with which they meet him. His every want is promptly sup^ied ;

crater is brotight for his feet; food is immaiiately prepared and set tefbre Mm, and 
every provision is made for his comfort and repoee. He goes not from honse to honsei 
iMity having found a shelter under one roof, he would do injustice to his kind host t^ 
leave it for another lodging in the same village. He salutes the house on entermg ; Yob 
peace rests upon it ; and he departs with a blessing. I think I neter saw the expressMMM 
of hospitality in such i)rimitive simplicity as exhibited among thd Nestorian Christians* 
N'or is their general kindness to the poor and suffering less remarkable. None are 
turned empty away : and those who have the means, often lay up extra stores for tks 
poor, and for montns together provide them food and shelter. Lev. xix^ 34. Deut. 
X. 18, 19. 

Their entertainments are in the true Hebrew style. The guests are invited by a 8Â«r- 
vant, who is often* sent round the second time when the feast is ready. Each one is 
seated by the master of the feast according to rank, the more honorable being invited to 
come up higher, while the others give him place ; the governor of the feast presides ; 
the social bowl circulates : all dip their hands into the dish, and occasionally one dips a 
sop and gives to another (a special kindness.) They sit upon the carpet or floor, and 
W fomard, eating their plain food in a primitive manner 

At their joyous festivals they have music and dancing; the tabret and viol, and 
David's harp, and the voice of singing. They observe their new moons and Sabbaths or 
solemn feasts. In mauming, they often cast dust upon their heads, rend their garments, 
clothe themselves in sackcloth or coarse attire, and sit in the ashes or go to the grave to 
i?veep there. 

In their dress, too, there is a striking conformity to that of the Jews about them ; and. 
^while their loins are girded about, their staff is in their hand, and their feet are shoa 
with sandals. These last are sometimes made of hair, and at others of raw hide or 
leather, aifiB little more than cover the sole of the foot. 

Among thefar ornaments are earrings i^id nose-jewels ; chains and mufflers, or span- 
gled ornaments ; headbands and stomachers ; bracelets on their hands, rings on their 
fingers, and plaiting of the hair ; though in the mountains there is more of the modest 
simplicity of the days of Sarah. 

Their employments are those of early antiquity. We see the damsels coming daily to 
draw water, with their pitchers on their shoulders, cleaning wheat in the fields in the 
time of harvest, or, likellachel, tending their father's flocks; while the virtuous woman 
seeketh wool and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands. She layeth her hand to 
the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff, both being literallv held in the hand. 
"Women are seen grinding at a mill,f or braying wheat with a pestle in a mortar to sep- 
arate the hull,t or churning milk (not cream) to bring forth butter, or gathering the 
grass, * which to-day is and to-morrow is cast into the oven ;' making bottles of skins 
or leather to contain the wine which has been trodden in the wine-press by the feet. 
The vineyards, the threshing-floors, the winnowing of wheat while the chaff is driven 
"before the wind ; the threshing instruments having teeth ; the reaping and the shouting 
of the harvest; the turning the rivers of water to fertilize their fields; planting of wil* 
lows and other trees by the water-courses ; the ploughs ; the pruning-hooks ; the lodge 
in the gardens of cucumbers or melons ; their food and driuK, and the time of their 
meals; their domestic animals, beehives, and sheepfolds; their dwellings and amuse* 
tncDts ; their walking and sleeping upon the house-tops, and many other customs and 
peculiarities, are equally common to the ancient Israelites and the modem Nestorians. 

It would surpass our limits to speak of other usages which might have been named 
in this connection, and much more to dwell upon them at length. But there are a few 
customs, particularly those relating to the marriage union, and to their pastoral Ufe, 
which ought not to be passed over in this cursory manner. 

Among the Jews, the father of a family selects wives for his sons, and husbands for 
his daughters. If a son had a preference for any person as his wife, he asked <h^ 
father to obtain her fVom her father. But the father could not give the daughter in 
marriage without the consent of the brothers. || These are the very rules observed hf

XVIL INDIA- 



The British empire in India took its beginning rather less than a hundred years a^ 
The English East India Company was first established in the year 1600 ; but, down ta 
the mid(Ee of the last century, its great object was trade. It was to protect and facilitate 
this trade that it obtained posseHsion of several small tracts, on which forts were built 
fw the protection of its servants and goods ; and it was in this way that its territorial 
occnpation began. Fort 8t George, about which grew up the city of Madras, was built 
in 1638. The island of Bombay, given to Charles II. by the Spanish court as the doviy 
of his wife, being transferred to the East India Company, became in 1687 the Indian 
bead-quarters of the Company. Fort "William, the nucleus of the great city of Calcnttt, 
was built in 169% 

The next step towards territoral dominion, was the taking as security for money Ifnt 
to the native prinoes, in the neighborhood of the Company's establishments, the coUec- 
taon of the taxes of certain districts, and along with it, according to the custom of India, 
a certain political authority 

The Company next began to take a side in the quarrels of the native princes, to raise 
armies and nght battles ; and presently it became master, where it began by being aDy 

This result was mainly produced by the rivalry and hostility of the French and Eng- 
lish ; for the French also had an East India Company, and forts and factories in Hin- 
dostan. The war which began in Enrope and America, in 1743, between the French 
end English, spread also to udia, where it raged, almost without intermission, for 17 
years ; at the end of which period the English succeeded in expelling the French from 
India, or at least in confining them to their original factories ; while they themselves it- 
mained masters of the Carnatu:,,^ large tract of country in the vidnity of Madm.

>tixiiig the same oontart, tbey had also acquired a great ascendency and influence in 
Sen^al ; and, in 1765, lord Clive obtained, in absolute sovereignty, for the Company, the 
provinces of Bengal^ Bahar^ and Orissa^ a territory 150,000 square miles in extent, wttb 
H),OOO,O00 inhabitants* In India, aU the land is held subject to the payment of a certaiii 
a.rge proportion of the produce to the government, in lieu of taxes ; the government, in 
a.ct, is the owner of the land, and the East India Company obtained their first territorial 
sessions in a mere tradinc; spirit, in hopes of making money out of the government share 
>f the produce. In this, however, they found themselves very much mistaken. The ex* 
;>eii8e8 of war reduced them to bankruptcy ; and this circumstance, together with the 
atbnses and plunder of the natives, which grew out of their civil and military power, led 
to the interference of parliament by which the political power of the Company was, from 
time to time, curtailed and its constitution essentially modified. Thus at the renewal of 
the charter of the East. India Company, in 1833, it changed its character entirely. It 
Deased altogether to be a trading company. It consists, now, of certain holders of India 
Btock, which is sold every day in the market, and of which any person who has money 
may become a purchaser, thereby becoming entitled to receive a certain annual dividend 
out of the Indian Revenue, and to vote in the choice of Directors. The whole power of 
the Company is vested in the Board of Directors, who are chosen annually at a meeting 
of the stockholders, any stockholder to a certain amount being eligible. This Board of 
INiectors, who hold their sessions at the India House, have the general superintendenc6 
of the government of India, with almost all the immense patronage growing out of it ; 
subject, however, on all points involving political results, to the authority of a Board, 
called the Board of Control, consisting of three persons appointed by the Crown, the presi- 
dent of which is a member of the Cabinet The local government, in India, is under the 
superintendence of a Governor General, whose residence is at Calcutta, and who is also 
the immediate head of the Bengal presidency, to which belongs almost the whole of the 
extensive, fertile, and populous countries watered by the Granges. The other two presi- 
dencies, of Madras and Bombay, are subject to the Governor General, in kll that concerns 
military operations and the relations with foreign States, but in their local administration 
they are independent Each presidency has courts of its own. Almost an entire monop- 
oly of all civil and military ofiices, under the Company, is enjoyed by a body of men 
constantly recruited by cadets, young men sent out from England, who enter either the 
civil or military branch of the service, and rise gradually, by regular promotion. All the 
higher officers enjoy very large salaries. The standing army of India, by which the 
power of the Company is maintained, consists of 200,000 men, of whom \>xxt a small por- 
tion are Europeans. The bulk of the army is composed of native regiments, officered by 
Europeans, who are found to make excellent soldiers. At present, no native caif rise in 
the afmy to anything more than a non-commissioned officer. 

Since the last modification of the charter of the East India Company, a great change 
has taken place in the spirit and administration of the Indian government Before that 
time, the press was unoei a strict censorship ; Europeans were forbidden to buy land 
and to settle in India ; the natives, especially the richer ones, were studiously mortified and 
kept under; now, the settlement of Europeans is encouraged, and they are fast making 
a great change in the agriculture of India by introducing the cultivation of sugat, coffee, 
cotton, etc., according to European methods. The press has become perfectly free ; all 
public matters are openly discussed, and a great influence is thus exercised on the ad- 
ministration of the government The present policy is to conciliate and bring forward 
the more intelligent and wealthy natives. The Persian language, introduced by Moham- 
medan conquerors, and which fonfi; continued the official language of the country, has 
been discarded, and English introduced in its place. The English is taught in schools 
and colleges, and is beginning to be extensively acquired by the young natives, as afford- 
ing an opening to employment under the government Domestic slavery* which formeriy 
existed to a considerable extent, has been abolish^ throughout the English territories. 

Encompassed by or included within the English presidencies, are several large territo- 
ries, which are still governed or misgoverned, so far as local matters are concerned, by 
their native princes ; though they have been stripped of the ri^ht of making over or keep- 
ing up an intercourse with foreign Btates, and are bound| m case of war, to furnish a 



certain ooBtiiigent to the Ang^o*Iiklian govenuneoi The kopgett x)f Hbeae Slates is tte

about 100,000 square miles in the centre of the Indian peninsula, with about ibfiOOfiU) 
of inhabitants. Joining him, on the east^ is the rajah of Berak or Nagpoor, ndth 70,066 
square miles and 3,000,000 people. Further south, and encircled by English t^ritoij.ji 
tiie kingdom of Mysore^ with 27,000 square miles and 3,000,000 inhabitants, the lemais- 
ing territories of tiiose formidable rivals of the English, Border Ali and Tippoo fiaih. 
At the very southern extremity of the peninsula are the two States of CocAm and Tro^fm- 
corCy with 8,000 square miles and IfiOOflOO inhabitants. Near the western coast of tk 
peninsula, are the three Mahratta States, with about 20,000 square miles and 2,000^< 
inhabitants. North of the Ganges is the kingdom of OudejWiih. 20,000 squace miles aad 
3,000,000 inhabitants ; and in the north-west of India are a number of dependent States^of 
which Guzerat, with 18,000 square miles and 2,000,000 of people is the principal, tk 
great desert and the hilly districts between the Granges and the Indus, as virell aa the haisb 
of that river, were recently occupied by a great number of princes, more or leas indepefid- 
ent, known as Rajpoots and Seiks ; but all or most of these, including the "wrhole lower 
valley of that^iver, and the feimous and fertile district of the Punjaub, have recently beeo 
brought under British rule. 

The principal reason why these native princes have been permitted to maintain soloo^ 
the local administration of their respective countries, is to be found in the fact that, vi^ 
very few exceptions, those countries embrace the least fertile, least popnlous, and least 
accessible parts of India, deserts, hills, or swamps, as to which the English have doubted 
whether the revenue would pay the expenses of government But the incapaei^ asd 
mismanagement of the native rulers becomes every dav more apparent in contrast with 
the condition of things in the presidencies. Their people are a [Mey to robbers, to an iB- 
disciplined soldiery, or to famine, the result of excessive exactions by the government ; aid 
the necessity of displacing all the existing native princes, and consolidating all India w- 
der a uniform system of administration, becomes every day more apparent. 

Much has been said and written about the oppression and extortion of the English inlndk- 
Fortunes were formerly made there by very questionable means ; yet in the \7orst time? 
the English were far more moderate than the native princes ; ana the people of India, 
though they have, at times, suffered severely from some ill-considered experiments as to 
the collection of taxes and the holding of land, have gained much in the overthrow ef 
their native governments. This is the opinion of all the most intelligent natives. At 

firesent, the government of India is, and must long remain, in many respects, a despotism 
t is exercised, however, by governors whose conduct is watched and criticised by a free 
press,^ne of the most efficient restraints known upon abuses of power, and who arc le- 
sponsible, not indeed to the people of India, but to the East India Company, the Board 
of Control, the British Parliament, and finally the British people. Hitherto, indeed, the 
knowledge of the condition, wants, and sufferings of India, has been confined to a fim- 
ited few ; but they are now be^ning to attract more general attention. Railroads are 
beginning to be introduced, and great efforts are being made fo introduce the cultivation 
of cotton of the American kinds and according to American methods, and the prospect 
now is that a large infusion of European civilization will be gradually transferred into 
India. But as long as the existing system of caste survives in its full strength, it is in vain 
to look for any decisive improvement. There are strong indications, however, that in 
the minds at least of the more intelligent natives, the whole fabric of Hindu supersti- 
tion, ancient and compact as it is, is being gradually undermined-

Birmesa State Carnage. 

XIX. BIRMAN EMPIRE. 

For the following facta and descriptioiis, we are indebted to the travels of the Rev. 
Howard Malcom, of Boston. They tlu-ow great light on the Boodhist religion, which has 
perhaps more Totaries than any other existing faith. 

" The coast at Amherst presents noble mountain scenery, but is entirely uninhabitahle, 
as is the case also with numerous islands, and which form almost a continuous chain, 
a. few mUes from shore. Dense forests cover the whole, presenting throughout the year 
a rich and varied verdure. To avoid three or perhaps four days' delay in going round 
Tavoy Point, and up the river, I was set ashore, with a few articles of immediate neces- 
sity, at Moung^ma-goung, a small Birman village, eight or ten miles' walk from Tavoy. 
It stands nearly a mile from the shore, with wide paths and good houses, beautifully 
shaded by noble trees, especially the bunyatha or jack, a species of the bread-fruit. In 
a Birman village, the zayat is the only tavern. It consists of a shed with a floor raised 
three or four feet from the ground, and wide verandas to keep off the sun. The quality 
of the building varies with the wealth and generosity of the villagers. Some are truly 
splendid. As chairs and tables are out of the questi n, and as every traveller carries his 
own provision, here is an ample hotel. The neighbors readily furnish water, and fruits 
seem free. A little fire, kindled near, cooks the rice; an hour's slumber follows the un- 
pretending meal, and all things are ready for a start. 

After some repose, the cooley (or porter) having adjusted the baggage at the ends of a 
pole, placed it on his shoulder, and walked on as guide. After passing some patches of 
pine-apples, and many noble fruit-trees of kinds unseen before, we entered the jungle, 
and began to wind our way over the mountains, which extend along all this coast, 
and terminate at Tavoy Point. Though no rain had fallen since October, the foliage 
â– was fresh and intense. Flowers, great and small, beamed on us at every step, and m 
some places filled the air with fragrance. Innumerable vines, creeping, climbing, and 
depending, seemed to intertwine the trees for mutual support. A great variety of para- 
sites clung to the branches, sometimes with very large leaves, fonning a complete and 
beautiful sheath to the entire trunk, and sometimes sending down long stems thirty or 
forty feet, waving to the breeze like small ropes. The lower portions of the mountBin 
are of coarse, gray granite, the higher parts of some friable stone with which I was not 
aequainted ; the soil generally a stiff, reddish clsy. 

The toVm andsabm'bs of Tavoy contain 1,845 hoases, with a population of 9,045 sodIb. 
Of these, abont two hundred are Chinese men, generally married, and, of course, to 
Arman females. There are ako Malays, Malabars, Musaclmans, etc The etreets are

its miUtary and civil establishments, which is said not to be the case with any other a 
these provinces. The number of priests is estimated at about four hundred. Of mm 
there are about fifty ; of whom all I saw were beyond middle life, and generally won 
the aspect of n^endicants. 

Two days' journey from Tavoy, a considerable number of Karens, conTcrted in iai- 
ferent places, have been brought together, and formed into a Christian village ; the fae^ 
of every family being members of the church. These Christians now amount to aboot 
two hundred, and conduct themselves with exemplary rectitude. By the aid of the missks- 
aries, they have obtained goats, bullocks, oil-mills, seeds, &c. ; and with these, and stOl 
more by the increased industry they have been taught to practise, they have beei 
enabled to cease their wanderings, and acquire many comforts to which their coimtry* 
men are strangers. Cleanliness, in which Karens are universally deficient, has been 
attained in no small degree. The men have been exhorted to raise plenty of cotton, and 
the women induced so to apply themselves to spinning and weaving, as to furnish everj 
one of their families with a chanse of raiment They now wash their garments dio, 
which before they scarcely ever did. Their ground, under their houses, nrhich alwafs 
used to be receptacles for filth and vermin, is all swept out clean every Saturday afier- 
noon, and the mbbish burnt. On Sunday, they come to public worship perfectly clem, 
and, as their costume covers the person entirely, the sight would please the most fastidi- 
ous American eye.* 

The city of Maulmein was only a few years ago a jungle, though some intelli^t 
natives affirm that it was once a large city, and the metropolis of a Shyan kingdom, thea 
independent. After the cession of these provinces to the English, it was selected as a 
military post, and a town sprang up, which has continually increased, and numh^rs dov 
18,000 souls. The rest of the province contains about 30,000 more, of whom some 
thousand are Karens and Toungthoos. The city consists principally of one str^ 

. which extends along the river about two and a half miles. The river is about a mile 
wide, with a tide of twenty feet perpendicular rise. In the rear, distant about a qnartei 
of a mile, is a long, narrow hill, running parallel to the river, presenting along its sam- 
mit a string of pagodas mostly fallen to ruin. From a fine road, made here by Sir A. 
Campbell, the whole city, with the river, shipping, and high hills on the opposite island 
of Balu, are in full view. The location of the city has been found exceedingly salu- 
brious, and gentlemen in the Company's service are glad to resort hither for health, from 
the opposite shore of the Bay of Beneal. The settlement is too recent to be adomei 

. with noble shade-trees, like Tavoy and Mergui, but is well laid out, and the Birmans, 

! always tasteful in such matters, have planted them to a sufficient extent Over tbe 
water-courses are handsome bridges of substantial masonry ; and fine roads are made 
in various directions. 

Being the metropolis of British Birmah, the commissioner or acting governor residei 
here. The garrison consists of a regiment of the line, a detachment of artillery, and 
some companies of sepoys. The officers of this force, and the gentlemen connected wiA 
the civil service, make a considerable circle of English society, which, with soldiers, 
traders, &c., and their families, insure all the conveniences of an abundant market, 
various mechanics, and well-supplied shops. In the market may always be had fireA 
beef, pork, goat, venison, and poultry, butter, effgs, milk, &c., with great plenty of the 
finest fish, fruits, and vegetables. In passing through it one day, I counted thirty-two 
difierent kinds of fruit, besides vegetables. The price of articles, with some exceptioDs, 
is cheaper than in our cities, â€” ^fowls, two rupees a dozen; rice, half a rupee a bushd 
The best of baker's wheat-bread is sold at about our rates, and British goods are in gen- 
eral cheaper than with us. On the whole, it is perhaps as pleasant and desiraUe a 

. residence as any part of the East

The imports from l\tvoy and Mergni are principally attaps, or dennees, (leares stitched 
upon strips of ratan, ready for thatching,) damar torches, cardamons, sapan wood, 
9Mipee, ratahs, preserved doryans, mats, salt, yams, and ivory. In return are asnt la

From Rangoon are imported cutch or catechn, stick lac, gram, oil-seed, earth-oi^ 
^esamnm-oil, lappet, (tea) wheat, ivory, lackered ware, glazed pottery, ja^ery, (black

cotton, dates, English goods, cocoa-nuts, &c. 

From Penang are brought umbrellas^ muskets, toiehes, dates, coffiae, i&c. ; and in 9^ 
tvm are sent chiefly paddy and rice. 

Fiom Ga(pntta are broug^it specie, English goods, wines, ginger, steel, rose^-waieiL 
sugar ; and almost the only important return is teak timber. The same may be said oi 
Madras. This is about the whole commerce of Maulmein. From eight to twelve vet* 
Â«els enter and clear per month. 

Among the inhabitants are 600 Chinese, and above 2,000 other foreigners, most of 
orhom are from Bengal and Madras. Each class has a place of worship, and adberss 
â€¢o its national costume and habits. The English have a Company's chaplain, and a 
sapacious church. Here service is regularly performed, and the troops are requiced k^ 
â€¢tt^dd. The E^og^h Baptist church have also a good meeting-house of teak, and one 
â‚¬)i the missionaries always acts as pastor. At present, Mr. Osgood discharges this dutfi 
in connection with his engagements at the printing-office. 

Though there is not the slightest restraint upon idolatry in these provinces, the peopls 
are certainly less devoted to ti^dr superstitions than before the war. It is scarcely possi- 
ble to discover from the appearance of the strisets, when the worsliip^ays oociur ; and 
' tbÂ» number of priests is much less than it would be among an equal population in Bit- 
mah Proper. The poople are evidently ripenhig for some change. There is iherefoae 
eminent necessity for following up, with the utmost vigor, the means for extending 
* Christianity. The morals of me people would greatly suffer by the loss of theur reU- 

Eious system, if no other were to be substituted. Such a crisis is not altogeth^ improba- 
le, and the people of God are most affectingly called upon, by the state of the casOf lo 
â€¢end out more teachers forthwith. 

Still, Boodhism is as yet by no means a n^ected system. New pagodas aie making 
their appearance in difSegrent parts of the city. There are twenty-nine kyoungs, contain- 
ing somewhat more than 600 priests, including novitiates, who are plentifully supported. 
The kyoungs are vastly superior to the dwellings of the common people, and some of them 
soe situated in delightful groves with ample grounds. Here and there is a sacred ban- 
nian-tree, carefully nurtured, and occasionally lighted with lamps at night. In the citf 
and suburbs are seyenty-ei^t pagodas. 

The name of Rangoon is so conspicuous in the annals of our mission, and occurs m 
often in the narratives of travellers on this coast, that I naturally entered it with feelings 
of peculiar interest Association of ideas, of course, keeps up some of that interest : 
but so wretched a looking town, of its size, I have nowhere seen. The city is spreac 
upon part of a vast meadow, but little above hig^ tides, and at Uiis season resembline Â» 
neglected swamp. The approach from the sea reveals nothing but a few woooen 
houses between die eity wail and the shore. The fortifications are of no avail againsS 
modem modes of attack. They eonsist of merely a row o{ timbers set in Ae ground, risings 
to the height of about eighteoi feet^ with a narrow platform running round inside m 
musketeers, and a few cannon, perhaps half a dozen in all, lying at the ffateways, inji 
useless condition. Some considerable streets are back of the town, outsiae the walls. 

The entire population is estimated at 50,000, but that is probably too much. ThÂ«pe 

-as no other seaport ra the empire, but Bassein, which has little trade, and the city stands 

next in importance to A va ; yet there is literally nothing in it that can interest a traveller. 

A dozen foireignem, chiefly Monguls, have brick tenemaits, very shabby. Theve ase

-isf tMf haUts and cHmate; but in appeftiance as pal^ as potaible. Manlmeim ini 
already manv better buildings. The eaves of the houses generally descend to vriibm 
mx or eight feet of the ground ; very few beinÂ§ of more than one story, or having anj 
ndier covering than thatch. Cellars are unknown, and all houses are raised two ca three 
feet above the ground for coolness and ventilation. As the floors are of split bambw, 
all dirt falls through, and what is not picked up by crows, dogs, fowls, &X2., is occaskHh 
ally swept out and burned. For nearly half the year, the city presents a most singohr 
Â«ppearance, half sad, half silly. By a standing law, on the setting in of the dry seasoo, 
all the thatch must be removed, except a particular kind, not common, made partly of 
jplit bamboo, which will not easily burn. Were it not for the people in the streets, bjA 
4he cloths of various kinds put up in the houses to keep off the sun, it would seem at 
Aese times, like a city deserted. 

The streets are narrow, and paved with half-burnt bricks, which, as wheel-carriÂ»gB 
-mte not allowed within the city, are in tolerable repair. There is neither wharf nor quay. 
In four or five places are wooden stairs, at which small boats may land passengers \ bst 
-even these do not extend within twenty feet of low-water mark. Vessels lie in the 
Â«tream, and discharge into boats, from which the packages, slung to a bamboo, are hig- 
-fed on men's shoulders to the c^ustom-house. 

The commerce of the place is still considerable, though greatly crippled by enoncoos 
port-charges, and absolute prohibitions against exportmg rice oi' the precious metals. 
â€¢Specie is exported, but only by adroit smuggling. Could rice be exported freely, a moA 
benefidal trade, both to government and people, might be carried on, the agricultniist 
- receive a better reward for his toil, and the price of land be raised throughout the king- 
dom. Paddy is now selling at five rupees the hundred baskets; that is, about $2,50 fer 
a hundred bushels ! 

Ava is surrounded by a wall twenty feet high, embracing a space of about seven miks 
in eiiemnference. Within this is a considerable area, enclosed by a better wall, with a 
broad, deep ditch, called 'the little city.' This space is chiefly occupied by the palace, 
â€¢hall of justice, council-house, and the dwellings of some of the nobility, but coantains 
also some well-built streets, and many inhabitants. The palace itself, and public build- 
ings, are enclosed in a third wall, which is itself enclosea in a stockade. A very large 
part of the city is outside of all these walls, on the margin of the rivers. On the east is 
the river Myet-nga, or Little River, a fine stream, a hundred and fifty yards broad, ex- 
lending far into the interior. The Irrawaddy, opposite the city, is without islands, and 
compressed to a breadth of eleven or twelve himdred yards. 

The sacred edifices, as usual, are the prominent objects, which, on every 'side, seise 
the attention. They are almost as numerous as at Paghan, and some of them of equal 
size. Viewed from the river above, their white and gilded spires give the city an exceed- 
ingly imposing appearance, which is not realized on entering it. 

The pagodas are even more various in their shapes than at Paghan, amd far surpass 
in taste and beauty any I have seen. Most of them are over one hundred feet high, ax^ 
some more than two hundred. Colossal images of bell^metal, marble, and brick, covered 
with stucco, are innumerable. One which had just been finished out of a solid block 
of white marble, is truly stupendous. I had no mode of taking his vast proportiocs, 
but measured his hand, and found the breadth twenty inches. As his proportions woe 
just, this would make his height, had he been in a standing posture, about thirty-five 
feet. 

It is said there are in the city twenty thousand priests, including novitiates ; and the 
number and size of the monasteries seem to sanction the computation. The queen's 
monastery has five hundred ; and that which I have described above had three hun- 
â€¢dred regular priests, and about the same number of novitiates. It should be remembered 
that they are in fact colleges, and nearly all who are receiving a regular education are 
in them as novices. 

These buildings are found in almost every part of the city, enclosed by fine brick 
walls and shady walks. They are the only specimens of beauty and grandeur which 
the city can boast, except the pagodas, the palace, and a few zayats. Aristocratic fed- 
ings prevail even in these abodes of pretended sanctity ; and into some of them, nont 
but yonlb of the higher classes are admitted. A munber of our disciples, who have been 
novitiates, speak imfavorably of the morals of the prksihood. Droned like other citi> 
â€¢ens, tliey may go anywhere after dark without being recognised. 



BIRHAN EMPIRE. ; SÂ«8 

The palace is entirely of wood. It consiflts of neatly a' hmidr^d buildincs, of diS^t- 
mt sizes, and occupies a space about a quarter of a mile lone, and almost as Moad. I^e 
roofs all have the royal order of architecture. The hall oi audience is in a sumptuofeis 
ind. convenient building, standing on a terrace of stone and mortar, which constitutes 
the floor, and is coated with stucco, hard and polished. Lofty pillars, richly carved, 
mpport the roof, and, like the rest of the building, are covered with gold. The roof 
rises like a steeple, with many stages, and is a htmdred and ninety-five Â£9et high. 

The streets of Ava cross each other at right angles, and are wide, straight, and clean, 
t>ut not paved. The ceptre is kept smooth and clean for foot passengers, while the sides 
ire appropriated to wheel-carriages, elephants, &c. Much of the labor of transportation 
is done by bullock carts. Their bodies are framed of timber, with bamboo yoke, and 
the wheels of wood, without tire. I saw no horses used for draught; but handsome 
t)iillock carriages are used by the wealthy. They are without seats, of course, and the 
9oor is nicely matted or cushioned. The animals, being used only for this purpose, trot 
ilong quite briskly. Around their necks are strings of bells. The houses are not gen* 
orally better than in other large towns, but, thatch being entirely prohibited, they look 
more respectable. The roofs are covered with short pieces of bamboo, so arranged as 
to look exactly like shingles. Great men generally Uve in the centre of some square, 
Hirrotmded by the houses of their many retainers. Most of them have a good brick 
t>uilding, of two or three rooms, intended not for occupancy, but as a fire-proof deposi- 
tory for their valuables. These have very lately become common, and with some fine 
brick monasteries just erected, and a sort of arsenal now ih progress, indicate a general 
introduction of brick houses. Nothing but the absurd prohibition of the govemmant 
has prevented this long ago. In some of these enclosures are pleasant gardens and frwit- 
trees. 

As to the population of the city, I was at much pains to obtain correct information. 
The accounts obtained from government ofScers did not differ much from each other. 
They said a census was recently taken, which gave 30,000 houses for the city axid 
suburbs, without including any adjacent villages, and that ten per cent, ought to be ad- 
ied for omissions. They computed seven persons to a house, and thus m&e the popu- 
lation 200,000. As the government actually receives taxes on 30,000 houses, there does 
Qot seem room for estimating the number lower ; but I am confident it must include the 
district. Mr. Crawfurd allows only 30,000. A severe fire occurred just before my ar- 
rival, which was reported by the proper officers to the kins, as having destroyed 1,000 
houses, beside huts and temporary residences. I examined the ground carefully^ and 
compared it with the rest of the city, over all of which I rode, repeatedly. ThÂ© result 
j{ the whole induces me to estimate the population of Ava at about 100,000. nnie 
whole city and kingdom beins divided into tens of houses, under an officer, and every 
ten of these officers being under a superior, who has charge of them and their hundred 
houses, a census, at least under the very eye of government, must be tolerably correct 
Taxes are assessed on families as such, without regard to wealth. The head man is the 
tax-gatherer. If he can tax one hundred houses, and report only ninety, he puts the 
balance into his pocket. A Birman census is thus almost always less than tl^ truth. 

The city abounds with shops, containing nearly every article of foreibpm goods, and 
an ample number of mechanics ; though in some particular branches there are none. I 
purchased specimens of carpentry, jewelry, tin-ware, toys, das, lackered boxes, earthen- 
ware, gongs, &c., which were highly creditable to their skill. Their boat-buikting, 
carving, sculpture, gilding, basket-making, and weaving, are as good and ingenious as 
in America, for aught I could see, making due allowance for the differences of form, te., 
established by national custom! I got some paintings executed in their best style by 
native artists, one of whom is the king's painter, which are about equal to the pictures 
on common clocks and looking-glasses. In landscapes they fail utterly, having no idea 
of perspective. Many of our trades are wholly unknown to the Birmans* 

The climate of Ava, most of the year, is delightful. The cool season lasts from the 
middle of October to the early part of April. During this period, heavy fogs prevail 
early in the morning, but they soon disperse, and leave a sunny sky. The thermometer 
at night, and toward morning, descends to 45Â° or 50Â° ; sometimes, though very rardy, 
to 4Sf ; rising in the middle of the day to 60^ or 7(f. Toward the end of Apid it be- 
gins to be hot, ahd the last of that month and whole of May are the trying portion of 
the year. The thermometer ranges from 85^ to 100Â°, risiiig^sometiipes even to HQP^ in a

wodd ; the stupendous brazen image of (iaudama, brought from Arracan ; the girl mea- 
tioned in Mr. Kincaid's journal, and by Major Crawford, as being covered widi loo^ 
fine hair, t6c.] but I could not spend the time necessary to see them, and, piocoiing a 
bullock cart, rode about to see the locaHties, extent of population, &c. 

It seems important to locate at least two missionaries at this place, not only for the 
109,000 inhabitants, but for the thousands of Chinese who may here be reached. Oae 
of the missionaries mi^t study Chinese, and be prepared at a future day to accompany 
the caraÂ»van to Ymman. The government would not interfere to prevent the conversiea 
of foreigners, and the converts wiiich we are bound to hope and believe would be made, 
might become most efficient missionaries to their countrymen. 

A few miles back of the city, the Chinese have some plantations of sweet cane, and 
manufiBLCture a large quantity of excellent brown and yellow sugar. I purchased some 
as ffood as our best yellow navana, at about four cents a pound. 

The immediate cognizance of the king secures this part of the ^npire from many ef 
the severe oppressions, under which more distant sections constantly groan; and tends 
in several other ways to increase its comparative population. It is, beyond doubt, the 
most densely inhabited part of the kingdom. Those whom I deemed best able to infonn 
me, stated that within a radius of twenty miles^ tbere must be at least half a million of 
people. 

Sandoway^ the capital of the district of that name, which unbraces all the southern 
part of Arracan, is situated on the Sandoway River, about twelve miles from the sea. 
It has a population of 4,000, chiefly Birmans and hklf-Birmans ; the rest are Mugs. 
No spot in India is considered more healthful than this. Prom h^ice a missionary 
plight operate extensively, not only in south Arracan, but up the Bassein River, and tte 
islands at its mouth, in Birmah F^oner. The British officer there is anxious for the 
settfement of a missionaxy, and would afford him every possible facility. It is the only 
n^t, beside those which have been named, wl^re a missionary could hope to live dnriiig 
me sickly season ; except perhaps Aeng, where a British eotnmissioner, dec, reside 
tfaroughont the year, Uiough at great huzard. No officer has been able to retain bis 
health there, and sevetoal have died.

The popaiatAen is usually given in books at 300,000, but, by the last official retiinMiÂ» 
is <Mily 937,000. The country is divided into four districts, vis., Akyab, Ramree, Saar* 
dovay, and Aenff; of which Akyab has 108,166 inhabitants; Bamiee, 68,034; Sando* 
way, 32,976 ^ and Aeac;i 11,751. In additioa to these, thece are hill tribes, not regularly 
numbered, amounting to about 25,000. 

Arrmc^n was formerly the principal city, and very large. It is now reduced to 3,000 
inhabitaals, scd is still diminishing. Its trade has passed to Akyab, at the moulh of 
tha river, a site sheeted by the English for its advantageous position for health and 
commeice, and now rapidly Rowing. The old city has been always fatal to foreigyien, 
though a favorite residenoe with the Mugs. The Binnans, who used to come with the 
governor When the country was their province, could not endure it Wh^i the Bntish 
took it and estabhsbed a camp there, two full European regiments were reduced, in a 
fav months, to three hundred men in both, â€” and even of sepoys and campÂ»followars 
(row forty to fifty died per day. Perhaps the particular circumstances of that aimy 
gave force to the pestilence, for nearly the same dreadful diminution attended the anny 
in Rangoon, coniinssedly one of the healthiest places in the world. 

This country is regarded as the parent hive of the Birman race and language. They 
ara certainly much less intelligent than the Birmans, and the country less piaqperousi 
doubtless in conseqnmce of frequent and desolating wars, and long oppression. The written 
language is precisely the saine as the Birman ; but the pronunciation of many letters is so 
difiment, as to make a dialect not very intelligible to Birmans. Why the language and 
people are called Mugs^ rather than* ilrrocanese, is not very clear. I was generally 
assured that it is derived from a race of kings, who reigned at the time the country first 
ba^ufne much known to Eusopesns. They r^g&rd the term as a contemptuous nicknamei 
and universally call themselves Mrammas. This name they declare to be usurped by 
the Birmans, whom they call Ouk-thoj or people of the low country. The Birman in 
turn takes this epithet as an insult 

The climate of Birmah differs greatly in the higher and lower districts, but is every 
whcMre salubrious to natives, where the jungle is cleared. Ample proof of this is visible 
in their robust appearance and muscular power. Foreigners nnd most parts of the sea- 
coast salubrious, to a degree not found in most other parts of India. 

In the maritime part of the country, there are two seasons â€” the dry and the rainy. 
The latter begins with great uniformity, about the tenth of May, with showers^ which 
gradually xrow more frequent, for four or five weeks. It afterward rains almost daily- 
till the middle of September, and occasional showers descend for a month longer. From 
one hundred and fiity to two himdred inches of water fall during this period. This 
quantity is truly astonisliing, as in the moist western counties of England, it is but sixty 
inches in a year. It seldom rains all day, so that exercise, and out-door business may 
be-continued, though at times it rains almost incessantly for several days. As the sun shines 
out hot almost daily, vegetation proceeds with amazing rapidity ; and every wall or 
building not coated smoothly with plaster, becomes in a lew seasons covered with grass 
ukL weeds. This is the only period when any part of the country becomes unhealthv 
k) foreigners, and even then the courses of great rivers, and parts extensively dearedi 
remain salubrious. On the subsiding of the rains, the air is cool, the country verdant, 
fruits innumerable, and everything in nature gives delight. The thermometer ran^ 
about 60Â° at sunrise, but rises 12Â° or 15Â° in the middle of the day. In March, it begms 
to grow warm ; but the steady fanning of the north-east monsoon makes it always pleas- 
ant, when out-door exertion is not required. In April, the heat increases, and becomes 
for two or three weeks oppressive ; but the first dashes of rain bring relief. 

Between tide- water ana the mountain regions at the north and east, there may be said 
to be three seasons â€” the cool, the lipt, and the rainy. The cool season begins about the 
same time as in the lower provinces, and continues till the last of February, making 
about (bar months. The thermometer now descends to about 40Â°, at the lowest. Thi 
tmpei;ature is only just before morning In the middle of the day, it, is seldom cold^.

hottest weafher, from 85^ to 9(f , but rismg sometimes mneh higher. 

In the most elevated districts, there are severe winters ; but of those sections no pis- 
cise accomits have been received. 

Mnch of Birmah is decidedly mountainous, particularly to the norft and east of Ava: 
but few of the ranges have names, at least not in our language. The nativss fleesn to 
designate particular heights, but not entire ranges ; and Europeans have not ezxdsved 
these parts of the country. The barrier which divides Birmah from Arracan, caUad ia 
maps A-nou-pec-too-miou, is lofty and well defined. The coasts near Tavoy, and tbe 
islands adjacent, are mountainous. But at present, nothing instrÂ«ctive eon be said as 
to this feature of the kingdom. 

Few countries have had their population so variously estimated. Old geogiaffain 
stated it at 30,000,000 ; Symes made it 17,000,000 ; Cox afterwards reduced it to 
8,000,000; and Balbi allows it only 3,700,000. The chief wo<m-gyee at Ava infoiwd 
me that the last census gave a total of 300,000 houses. Allowing a fraction short of 
seven persons to a house, this would make 2,000,000 ; presuming one third of the hooier 
to have escaped enumeration, we have 3,000,000. After the most carefol inqairies, 
I am led to put down the number of the inhabitants, to whom the Birman loDgos ii 
vernacular, at 3,000,000. This estimate was confirmediÂ»by many persons and niUDer- 
ous fects. The Shyans are probably 3,000,000 more, and, with other subsidiary tribes, 
bring up the total population to about the estimate of Cox. 

ThQ people, though not so tall as the Hindus, are more athletic. The average faeigbt 
of men is about five feet two inches, and of women four feet ten inches; that is te 
say, about four or five inches shorter than the average height of Europeans. Womm 
have more slender limbs than men, but are universally square-shouldered. Corpulewse 
is not more frequent than in this country. In features they are totally dissimilar to 
the Hindus, and rather resemble the Malays, especially in the prominence of cheek- 
bones, and squareness of the jaw. The nose is never prominent, but often flat, asd 
die lips generally thick. The complexion of young children, and those who have not 
been exposed to the sun, is that of our brightest mulattoes. Few, except among the 
higher classes, retain this degree of fairness, but none ever become, by many shades, 
so black as Hindus. I saw few whose complexions were clear enough to discover a 
blush. The standard of beauty seems to be a delicate yellow ; and in luU dress, a cos- 
metic is used by ladies and children which imparts this tint It is remarkaUe that 
this hue should be admired not only here, but amongst the almost black natives of 
Hindustan, and the many-colored inhabitants of the islands of the Indian Ocean. 

The hair of the head is very abundant, always black, rather coarse, and rendered 
glossy hy fi'equent anointings. On the limbs, and breast there is none, strongly con- 
trasting in this respect with Hindus, whose bodies are almost covered with hair. 
Their beard is abundant on the upper lip, but never extends over the cheeks, and is 
but scanty on the chin. 

Puberty does not occur much earlier than with us ; women bear children to nearlj 
as late a period. The average length of life seems not perceptibly different from that 
of Europe. 

Dwellmgs are constructed of timbers, or bamboos set in the earth, with lighter 

frfeces fastened transversely. When good posts are used, they are set seven feet apart; 
ighter ones and bamboos are placed closer. A frame set on stone or brick pillars, 
is never seen. The sides are covered, some with mats, more or less substantial and 
costly ; or with thatch, fastened with split ratans. The roof is usually of thatch, evai 
in the best houses. It is very ingeniously made and fastened on, and is a perfect secu- 
rity against wind or rain. The cheapest is made of strong grass, six or seven feet long, 
bent over a thin strip of cane four feet long, and stitched on with ratan. A better kind 
is made of attap or aennee leaves, in the same maimer. These are laid on like wide 
boards,* lapping over each other from twelve to eighteen inches. They cost a mere trifle, 
and last about three years. 

The floor is of split cane, elevated a few feet from the earth, which secures ventilatioo 
and cleanliness, and makes them far more comfortabte and tidy than the houses of Ben- 
gal. The open crevices between the slats, however, too often invite carelessness, bf 
suffering offal and dirty fluids to pass through ; and not unfirequently, among die low 
rankSj me space under the house is a nas^ miid^hole, ahve with varmin. Thb dosB

ttoSi windows are of uwt, slie&gtfaetied with a fhune of bamboo, and tied faait at ^ top.* 
Nhsa opened, they are propped up with a bamboo, and form a shade. Of course there 
kTe no chimneys. Cooking is done on a shallow 1mÂ»c, a yard square, filled with earth. 
Phe whole house may be put up in two or three -days, at an expense of from sixty to 
^ne hundred rupees, though many do not cost half that sum. Posts of common timber 
ast from ten to fifteen years, iron- wood forty or fifty, and good teak eighty or a bun* 
Ired. The houses of the more opulent, in large towns, are built of wood, with plank 
loors, and panneHed doors and wmdow-shutters, but without lath, plaster, or glass. 

Such houses famish a fine harbor for spiders, worms, lizards, and centipedes, but 
create no inconvenience in general, except the particles of dust which are constantly 
>owdered down from the thatch, as the worms eat it up. The lizards are not only 
larmless, but useful, by consuming flies, musquitoes, &c. The centipedes are poison- 
ms; but it is very rare that anyone is bitten, and the result is merely a paiiiful swelling 
fcnd inflammation for a few days. 

The rank of the opulent is particularly regarded in the architecture of the dwelling, 
md a deviation from rule would be instantly marked and punished. The distinction 
ies chiefly in hips or stages in the roof. 

The whole of the architectural skill of this people is by no means exhibited in thek 
Iwellings. Some of the zayats, pagodas, and temples, are truly noble. There can be 
lo doubt but that, if the people were not prohibited, they would often erect for them- 
selves substantial stone or brick buildings. It has been said that they have lost the art 
)f turning an arch, but this is wholly a mistake. I Jiave seen many fine arches, of large 
^an, evidently erected within a ^w years, and some not yet finished, constructeil 
MrhoUy by Birman masons. The stucco, which covers all buildings, is put on with 
extraordinary durability, and generally with tasteful ornaments. Floors and brick 
images, covered in this way, have often a poUsh equal to the most exquisitely wrought 
marble. The mortar is made of the best lime, and sand, with a liberal mixture of jag- 
gery, but without hair. No one can form a proper estimate of Birman architecture wh^ 
las not visited Ava, or one of the ancient seats of government Religious structures are 
;here far more numerous and magnificent than in distant parts of the empire. As in 
>ther countries, the state religion shines most, in temporal endowments and honors, in 
che neighborhood of the metropolis. 

Though Birmans spend all their zeal on useless pagodas, there are near the capital 
fome other structures of public utility. Some tanks have been constructed, which 
tecure irrigation and consequent fertility to a fine re^on of adjacent country. One of 
Lhese, near Mokesobo, is truly a noble work. Across the little river at Ava, and the 
narsh adjacent, is a very long bridge, which I have not seen surpassed in India, and 
scarcely in Europe. Various other edifices, both civil and military, ornament the 
metropolis, and would do honor to any people. 

Ship-building, on European models, is conducted on an extensive scale at Rangoon. 
Dolonel Franklin computes that, from 1790 to 1801, three thousand tons were built thus 
in that city. The cost of such vessels is a third less than at Calcutta, and a half less 
than at Bombay. Native vessels are very numerous, owing to the absence of roads, 
aind the great size and number of the water-courses. These are very inraiiously 
constructed, and admirably adapted to inland navigation^ though utterly unlike any- 
thing seen in this country. Some of them are of two hundred or two hundred and fifty 
tons burden. The canoes are often large enough to carry eight or nine tons. In exca- 
vating these, they do not first remove half the tree, but open only a narrow groove, and, 
after the excavation, widen it by fire. A single log thus makes a boat seven or 
eight feet wide. When opened to this extent, it is common to add a board, a food wide, 
round the edge. 

Cotton and silk goods are made, in sufficient quantity to supply the country. Some 
of them are fine and beautiful, but in general they are coarse and strong, and always 
high-priced. In getting the seed from the cotton, they universallv use a small and 
ingenious machine, of which a good idea may be got from the picture. It consists of 
two small cylinders, in contact, one of which, moved by a crank, turns the other : the 
cotton is drawn through, and leaves the ^eed behind. One person cleans thus ten viss, 
or thirty-six pounds, per day. About two thirds of the weight is left in seed. The seeds, 
sprinkled witn oil, are used for torches at festivals, ^., in the open air. The whole 
process of making cotton and silk goods from the raw material is managed by womeiL

On the whole, the Birmans are fully entitled to be called a civilized people. A 
lar government, a written language, an established literature, a settled abode^ foasiga 
commerce, respectable architecture, good roads and bridges, competent SEMnnfactam, 
adequate dress, gradations of rank, and the condition of women, oonspife to estahMi 
their claim to be so considered. Their exact place in the scale of mvilisatimi ia not m 
easily settled. In intellect, morals, manners, and several of the points juat naaiedf 
they are not surpassed by any nation of the east, and are certainly superior to m 
aatives of this peninsula. Prior to the recent entrance of Europeans, the degvee a 
civilization, whatever it was, seemed to be fized and complete. No change in lawi^ 
' babits, manufactures, food, dwellftigs, poetry, painting, car indeed anything else, bad 
been made for centuries, or if made, yet so slowly as to impart no excitement to the 
public mind. Now, tbe case is decidedly different They not only have contact witk 
many Europeans, but confess inferiority, and in some things are adopting ournAodeaand 
manufacture. In the Tenasserim provinces, this is especially the case; and abottUL 
England resign those possessions, the effects of her dominion on the popnlalion will 
remain and extend. If the present king should retain the views of state policy which 
he expressed to me while a subject; and which he is the fittest man in the kingdom to 
execute, Birmah must rapidly rise in political importanca 

Boodhism is probably, at this time, and has been for many centuries, the most pteva- 
lent form of religion upon earth. Half of the population of China, Lao, Ck)chin-China, 
and Ceylon ; all of Camboja, Siam, Birmah, Thibet, Tartary, and Loo-Choo ; and a 

reat part of Japan, and most of the other islands of the Southern Seas, are of this Â£uth. 
system which thus enchains the minds of half the human race, deserves the att^iitioa 
ef both Christians and philosophers, however fabulous and absurd. 

Chinese accounts make the introduction of Boodhism into that empire to have occaiied 
about A. D. 65. Marshman supposes the Siamese and Laos to have received the system 
about three centuries before Christ A very great increase of the Boodhis^ faith is haown 
to have occurred in China early in the sixth century, which may have resulted from the 
flight of priests with him, about that time, from the persecution of the Brahroinists. 

Boodh is a general term for divinity, and not the name of any particular god. Tbne 
have been innumerable Boodhs, in different ages, among different worlds, but in bo 
world more than five, and in some not any. In this world, there have been four Boodhs, 
viz., Kan-ka-than, Gau-na-gong, Ka-tha-pa, and Gaudama. In the Siamese language, 
these are called Kak-a-san, Ko-na-gon, Kasap, and Kodom. One is yet to come, riz., 
Aree-ma-day-eh. 

It has been often remarked, that Gaudama was one of the incarnations of Yishno, and 
appeared in the foftn of a cow. This idea has probably originated with the Hindus, 
and is advanced to support their assertion, that this religion is a branch of theirs. Bat 
no two systems can be more opposite, or bear less evidence of one being derived from 
tbe other. Brahminism has incarnations, but Boodhirai admits of none, for it has na 
aermanent God. If, in its endless metempsychosis, any being should descend firom the 
mghest (orias of existencci to take human nature^ it would not be an incamatioa 



Â£ISHAH. 319 

of Deity, but a real degradatton of being, and the person so descending would becbme, 
liieraUyj a man. If he ever rise again, it must be by another almost infinite change, 
now to better, and now to worse, as merit is gained or lost While Hinduism teaches 
one eternal deity, Boodhian has now no god. That has a host of idols; this only one. 
That enjoins bloody sacrifices ; this forbids all killing. That requires atrocious self- 
tortures^ this inculcates fewer austerities than even Popery. That makes lying, forni- 
cation, and theft, sometimes commendable, and describes the gods as excelling in these 
enormities ; this never confotmds right and wrong, and never excuses any sin. That 
makes absorption into Deity the supreme good ; this annihilation. 

The great doctrines of this faith are five ; viz. 1. The eternal existence of the universe, 
and all beings. 2. Metempsychosis. 3. Nicban, or annihilation. 4. The appearance, 
at distant periods, of beings who obtain deification and subsequent annihilation. 6. 
The obtainmg of merit Of the first four of these, enough has been already said. The 
laat is more deserving of notice, embracing, as it does, the whole system of morals. 

Merit consists in avoiding sins, and performing virtues ; and the pegree of it is the sole 
hope of the Boodhist. The forgiveness of sins, and the receipt of favor through the 
merit of another, are doctrines imknown. That sufiering can be in any way regarded 
as a blessing, is to him absurd. 

The sins which are to be avoided are described in a moral code, consisting of five 
principal and positive laws: â€” 1. Thou shalt not kill. 2. Thou shalt not steal. 3. 
Thou shalt not commit adultery. 4 Thou shalt not lie. 5. Thou shalt not drink any 
intoxicating liquor. These are explained and branched out so as to include all sins of 
the same kind, under each head. The first of these laws is extended to all killing, even 
that of animals for food. The very religious will not kill vermin. War and capital 
punishments are considered forbidden by the first law. 

Sins are divided into three clashes : â€” 1. Those of the body ; such as killing, theft, for- 
nication, &c. 2. Those of the tongue; as falsehood, discord, harsh language, idle talk, 
&c. 3. Those of the mind ; as pride, covetousness, envy, heretical thoughts, adoring 
false gods, &c. 

The sacred books portray strongly the evils of pride, anger, covetousness, and inordi- 
nate appetites. Men are urged to avoid excessive perfumes, ornament, laughter, vain 
joy, strong drink, smoking opium, wandering about the streets in the night, excessive 
fondness lor amusements, frequenting bad company, and idleness. Those who aspire 
to Nicban are cautioned to abhor sorcery, not to credit dreams, nor be angry when 
abused, nor elated when approved, not to flatter benefactors, nor to indulge in scorn or 
biting jests, and most carefully to avoid enkindling strife. 

The states of the mind are resolved into three classes: â€” 1. When we are pleased in 
the possession of agreeable things. 2. When we are grieved and distressed by evil 
things. 3. When neither do goSi things gratify us, not* evil things distress. The 
last is the best state ; and in it a man is rapidly preparing for Nicban. In this there is 
no small resemblance to the doctrine of the Stoics, and some approach to the Christian 
doctrine of weanedness from the world. Some of their books abound in good comparii 
sons ; such as, that he who runs into sinful enjoyments is like a butterfly, who flutters 
round a candle till it falls in ; or one who, by licking honey from a knife, cuts his 
tongue with the edge. There is scarcely a prohibition of the Bedagat, which is not 
sanctioned by our Holy Scriptures ; and the arguments appended to them are often just 
and forcible. 

Merit is of three kinds: â€” 1. Thela^ or the observance of all the prohibitions and pre- 
cepts, and all duties fairly deducible from them ; such as beneficence, gentleness, integ- 
rity, lenity, forbearance, condescension, veneration to parents, love to mankind, &c. 
2. Dana, or giving alms and oflerings. This includes feeding priests, building kioungs, 
pagodas, and zayats, placing bells at pagodas, making public roads, tanks, and weUs, 
planting trees for shaae or fruit, keeping pots of cool water by the way-side for the use 
of travellers, feeding criminals, biras, animals, &c. 3. Bawana, or repeating prayers, 
and reading religious books. Of this last, there are three degrees, or sorts ; the first 
consisting in merely reciting prayers, or reading thoughtlessly ; the second, and more 
meritorious, is praying or reading, with a mind attentive to the exercise; the third, and 
most excellent, is the performing these exercises with strong desires and awakened feel- 
ings. He who neglects to lay up merit, is compared to a man who sets out on a journey 
through an uninhabited country, beset with wild beasts, and provides himself neither 
with food nor weapons. 32 






BISMAK. 

It has been observed by travellers that this people i^wemkdlMY tolerant la rei ig io ui 
niatters. In a restricted sease^ this is certainly true. FcMre^ners of every deflchptm 
are allowed the fullest exercise of their ];pii|ion. They may build jdaces of vrcmfaip sf 
any kind, in any place, and have their pubtic festivaJis and processions, without moki- 
tation. But no nation could be more intolerant to their own peofde. No Bnimaa i&iy 
join any of these religions under th^ severest penalties. Despotic as is the goveilinKAt, 
in nothing does it more thoroughly display that despotism, tfian in its measures fat wof' 
pressing all religious innovation, and supporting the established system. The wfaoie 
population is divided into allotments of ten families, under a petty officer. Over evcrf 
ten of these allotments is another officer, to whom the others report. These ehiefe sf i 
hundred families are under the supervision of a higher officer, who take^ cognizsqce of 
all causes. On stated days, every chief' of ten families is required to bring 
company to the appointed observances. He does not indeed notke mere 
but if any person be habitually absent, he must produce either a good reason or a 
The whole population is thus held in chains, as iron*like as caste itsdf ; and to ' 
a Christian openly, is to hazard ever3rthing, even tife. 

In the British provinces, the national faith, being robbed of the support of the 
arm, seems to be cherished so much the more by national feding. Expeictancy 
religion of the new rulers may spread, seems to awake greater vigilance that it 
Pagodas, kyoungs, and priests are well supported, and the clergy seem imxious _^ 
pitiate popular mvor, to stand them instead of government patromige. It is thesefiMlH 
easier to distribute teaets, or . obtain an audience in Maulmdn, than in RanÂ§SM4t 
Ava, though schools are more easily established. Persecution is shown in i ii ni | Blii, 
except official. Neighborly acts are often refused ts Christians; andj in some 
were it not for the missionary, the convert could scarcely escape absolute want. 

No false religion, andient or moklern, is comparable to this. Its philosophy is, k 
not exceeded in folly by any other; but its doctrines and practical piety beat a 
resemblance to those of holy Scripture. There is scarcely a principle or prec^Bpt 
Bedagat which is not found in the Bible. Did the people but act up to its pfm 
peace and love, oppression and injury would be known no more within their 
its deeds of merit are in all cases either really beneficial to mankind, or harmlesK It 
has no mythology of obscene and ferocious deities ; no sanguinary or impure obs^t- 
ances; no self-inflicted tortures; nq tyrannising priesUiood; no c(Â»ifouDdmg of right 
and wrong, by making certain iniquities laudable in worship. In its moral codeÂ» its 
descriptions of the purity and peace of the first ages, of the shortening of man's life 
because^f his sins, &c., it seems to have followed genuine traditions. In ahnost every 
respect, it seems to be the best religion which man has ever invented. 

At the same time, we must regard Boodhism with unmeasured iepn>liatioo, if we 
compare it, not with other faMb religions, but with truth. Its entire base is false. It is 
built, not on love to God, nor even love to man, but on personal merit. It is a 
system of religion without a God. It is literally atheism. Instead of a beaveriy 
Fatfier, forgiving sin, and filial service from a pure heart, as the effect of lov^ it pre- 
sents nothing to love, for its Deity is dead ; nothing as the ultimate object of aetios but 
self; and nothing for man's highest and holiest ambition but annihilation*

I the 
destmctioQ of .the Tsttax dynaity, of whi<^ the loilitary piÂ«Btige waa destroyed by the 
reenlt of that war. 

"Whatever nsidts may ffOW oat of it, the oiifpa of that war, it most be oonfeaeed, 
was in the hig^st d^;ree diAgraceful to the British nation. It originated in the opinm 
trade. Alarmed at the yearly increasing coDsnmption of that pernicious stimulant, pro- 
duced in British India and Bmogj^d iato China, utd which in twenty years had risen 
from the annnal amount of $3,600,000 to $30,000,000, the Chinese eovemment, after va- 
rioos ineffectual attempts to put a stop to the trade, at length, in Maich, 1839, resorted 
to the decisive step of seizing and destroying all the opium then in Canton and its 
neighborhood, (the property, ohiefly, of Bntish merchenttt, who gave it up to save their 
lives), to the amount M some 90,000 chests. The forfeiture of smuggled goods is the 
nenal fKractiee of all nations, and yet the British made the refusal of the Chinese to pay 
ao indemnity for the opium destroyed (and in fact, â€” for they would have been satisQed 
with nothing less, â€” to allow the opium trade to go on aa before), the occasion for a 
war. In May, ISllj a British force attacked Cajiton, and having got nosseeaion of aU 
the fortifications, compelled the city to pay a ransom of 9^>000,OuO. The emperor BiSO 
refusing to yield to the demands of the Bntish, a strong armament proceeded northeriy^ 
and OD the 37th of Anguat, 1841, captured the city of Ajnoy, without the loss of a man, 
though the fortificatione were twj extensive, mounting aevertd hundred guna. Not long

Further operations were saspeaded by tbe settuig in of the monsoon ; bat in Jul;, 1^ 
a powerful naval armament, having a strong body of troops on board, entered tbe nam 
of the Yangtee Kiang, or Blue River, captured tiie towns and forts on its banks, and i^ 
proached the point where that river ia crossed by the imperial canaL Tbe Chinese foogk 
with great coarage ; but their total ignorance of the art of war made them quite ino- 
pable of any effectual resistance. A negotiation was accordingly opened and a tfeatrcf 
peace wan eoon concluded, near Nankin, by which the Chinese agreed to pay an iodna- 
nity to the English of 21,000,000 dollars, to cede to them the island of Hong KoDe.no: 
Canton, and to open five ports. Canton, Amoy, Foo-chow-foo, Shanghae, and Ningpg 
to the foreign trade. This indemnity has been since paid, and this Chinese war,tbcmoi: 
iniquitous one in which a Christian nation ever engaged, has been the only war everoi- 
ried on by the British which paid its own expenses. The opium-trade, which gaieiif 
occasion to the war, though no longer openly protected by the Engiisb, is still carried on ton 
great an extent as ever ; but the increase of traffic in other articles exported from the 
opening of the live ports, has failed, in a great meaiiiure, to be realized. 

Meanwhile, a rebellion has broken out against the Tartar authorities, â€” in all prebi-

In the ninth century, certain Arabian doctors mentioned a fragrant ajid fescinw* 
iog Chinese beverage, prepared from the plant called Sckah or SoA. After the lapK 
of some BIX hundred years â€” in 1633 â€” Olearius discovered that tea was domesticsiefl 
as a luxury among the higher ranks of society in Persia. It has since become a comnioii 
beverage in all civilized and uncivilized countries. All through tbe wastes of Cenml 
Asia, beyond Persia, among the Nomads with shifting tents who flit along thefar-A^i 
extremities of Russia, the Kirgish, the Calmucks, the Baschkiri, etc, tea is supreme, Bnt 
their use of it is' according to their condition. With them it Is no drink, but a solid ixnu- 
isbment. It has no appearance of delicately rolled leaves, but sticks and stalbs of the 
plant are made into heavy, stone-like cakes, of the color of tan-balls, and of tlie codsi^- 
ence of iron-bolts. This ia moistened and baked with the water of the Steppes, md

XXL JAPAN. 

Within a few years, a European traveller, Dr. Siebold, bad obtained admission, under' 
the patronage of the Dutch government, into this almost inaccessible country, and has 
^oyed, by a long residence at Nangasaki, micommon opportunities of gaining informa- 
tion respecting the inhabitants. 

This country forms a singular anomaly, which has succeeded until the present day, 
in keeping itself a stranger to the whole world, and isolating itself in such a manner, 
ttiat Europeans are as utterly ignorant of what is passing there, as if it were situated in 
one of the planets. But what is more singular is, that during more than one centtiry 
this same country kept np constant intercourse with Europe, that its sovereigns sent 
fhere the first ambassadors, who visited those distant countries in the east, and that it is 
perhaps the only one of those countries where the Christian religion ever made any con- 
siderable progress amon^ the educated classes. The Japanese have never shown the 
stiffness of the Chinese m repulsing foreign improvements. Even at the present day, 
their literary men, especially their physicians and naturalists, neglect no occasion to in^ 
struct themselves in me European sciences, and study the Dutch language, the only one 
(o which they have access, in order to perfect* their knowledge. 

With these communicative dispositions, on the part of the nation, how has its govern- 
ment succeeded in keeping it in the most complete isolation ? How has thfs government 
itself been able to preserve, for more than two centuries, the same inflexibility? How- 
ler indiscreet may have been the zeal of the missionaries, whatever broils they may* 
have caused, it would seem as if so long a space of time would have weakened, if it did 
Hot efface the remembrance of the civil wars which were the fruits of their proselytism. 
Mieantime, the successive efforts of the English, the Russians, and the Americans, tor 
establish communications, have been useless, and two hundrea years of prudence and 
ihoderation have not released the Hollanders from a single one of those humiliating pre- 
CttUtions, which the Japanese thought necessary to take, with regard to them, at the time 
of the expulsion of other nations. 

At the end of the last war, the Dutch government resolved to renew the relatione 
which had b^n for several years interrupts, and to endeavor to extend them as much 
$M possible. M. Siebold was chosen to accompany the embassy as a naturalist, and a 
physician : the result of his labors proves that it would have been difficult to have made 
a better selection. 

Coloncfl Sturber, who was appointed head of the Dutch establishment at Japan, went 
sit first to Batavia. It is generally in the month of June that persons intending to go to 
Japan quit that city, in order to profit by the south-eastern monsoon, which usually pre- 
vails at that period of the year. But the departure of the expedition was delayed a little, 
bv the necessary preparations, and it did not sail until the Â»8th of June, and on the 4tb 
01 July it entered the bay of Banca. 

This island derives its principal importance from its tin mines, which were not dis- 
covered until 1710, aftd then, in consequence of a fire which melted some small quanti- 
ties of it The Sultan of Palembang at that time began some works, and engaged a 
great number of Chinese families to come and establish themselves there. At first they 
took these mines on leases, but afterwards the Sultan decided to rqgulate them on his 
own account. His agents, called tykes^ enjoyed an almost unlimited power, even to 
the right of life and death over the Chinese, without the latter being &ble to appeal to 
the Sultan. The product of these mines is so considerable, that in the year 1823, it did 
no.t amount to less than 3,382,317 pounds. \ 

The 7th of July the navifi^tors again set sail, and on the 27th they saw the isle of 
Formosa, which tormerly belonged to Holland, and which was taken from them in 1662, 
by the Chinese pirate, Coxinga. They continued their voyage without stopping there, 
Aid on the 6th they met a Japanese junk, overturned on the side, and saved the crew,, 




266 JAPAN. 

who were in the utmost danger. But the Japanese laws punish so severely all comm. 
nication with strangers, that thej were forced, at the earnest prayer of the captain, & 
pierce a hole in che hold of this junk, to sink it ; for if by chance it had been thrown ci 
any point of the Japanese coast, the captain would never have been able to justify hiia- 
self tot havine taken refuge on board a foreign vessel. 

The 9th of August, the vessel arrived off Nangasaki ; though they had taken cai? 
to hoist the Dutch flag, they were not permitted to enter the port, until they had ok> 
tained permission. Some Japanese officers came on board, and brought some papen 
from the head of the Dutch commerce at Dezima; these papers contained general quo- 
tions respecting the name of the vessel and the captain, as well as the nimiber and 
quality of the persons who were on board. We hoisted immediately our flag of intelli- 
gence, says the narrator, which had been given us at Batavia, with particular instroc- 
tions respecting the anchorage on the Japan coast. When we had turned the northern 
point of the isle of Swo-Swima, several officers and Japanese interpreters came on boari 
to receive our papers, and some persons as hostages. They annoutibfed to us that u 
officer of high rank, bearing the title of bunjost, and some messengers from the factory, 
were coming to visit us. Since the celebrated adventure of the British ship of warFne- 
ton, in 1808, the government takes the precaution, before the Japanese officers and the 
Dutch from the factory board the ship, to demand hostages, and conduct them to De- 
zima, so that since this epoch, the Dutch vessels can no longer enter immediately the 
port of Nangasaki, but are obliged to remain at anchor during some time in the bay near 
the isle of Takaboko, (Papenberg) under the eye of the imperial guards. 

Toward noon arrived the gobanjosi, or envoy of the imperial guard. He was ac- 
companied by several interpreters, who put our author into great embarrassment, for he 
spoke the Dutch language with difficulty. It is known that the Swedish naturalist, 
Thunberg, had experienced the same difficulty. M. Siebold, however, succeeded in get- 
ting admitted, by persuading them that he belonged to a district of Holland, where i 
different dialect was spoken. 

The wind was so adverse, that, though towed by a number of barks, the author 
thinks several hundred, the vessel could not enter the port the same evening, and wu 
obliged to cast anchor at twenty-nine fathoms deep. While the Dutch vessels are not 
in port, they are treated as if they were at war ; all the garrisons of the forts in the bay 
are under arms, the corps de garde, the batteries, and a multitude of small vessels, arc 
covered with flags, banners, arms, and military ensigns, and are illuminated during the 
night. When the wind is unfavorable, these demonstrations last several days, ana oc- 
casion the government considerable expense. Thus it is perfectly useless for captains 
to press the Japanese, when the latter tow them into port, for it is their own interest to 
conduct them promptly to their destination. 

Several months before the arrival of the Dutch vessels, they place on the Cape Nomo, 
on the mountain near the city, fishermen, called Ko-se-to, and on a height near Nanga- 
saki, sentinels, who watch for the arrival of foreign vessels. As soon as a sail is per- 
ceived from the height of the Cape Nomo, the news is carried to Dezinia. They also 
take measures to give, in case of need, signals with rockets, from the tops of the moun- 
tains in the interior. 

The numerous batteries from the islands and from the shores of the bay are for the 
most part directed towards the entrance of the basin, and the entrance itself is again 
defended by strong batteries, raised on the two sides, as well as by a considerable garri- 
son, composed of troops, which bear the name of imperial guards. * This passage is 4o8 
yards in its greatest width, and 160 only in the most narrow place ; a chain is always 
kept ready to bar it in case of necessity. This disposition is little known, being pur- 
posely kept secret ; the fact is however certain, and the chain is kept in the magazifle 
of the navy, called Ofuna-Kura. 

We have extracted this passage almost entire, because it shows the minute precau- 
tions which are observed by the Japanese with regard to the Europeans. The navi- 
gators were still more surprised at seeing arrive on board, as soon as they had thrown 
anchor before Dezima, the Chevalier Cock Blomhoff, chief of the Dutch commerce. This 
dignitary, and the persons of his suite, wear the ancient Dutch costume, which has 
fallen into disuse for ages, but which could not be abandoned in Japan without eiciung 
the suspicions of the government of that country, who would have thought the least 
change of costume made them a new nation. A coat of embroidered velvet, a mantle 



JAPAN. 96Â» 

of black velvet, a hat with plumes, a sword, and a golden-headed cane â€” ^nothuig was 
wanting. One might have thought he saw the portraits of Rembrandt, or Tan Dyk, 
descending from their frames; and nothing could be better calculated to show the com- 
plete immobility to which this singular country has condenmed itself, in the midst of 
universal movement 

The island of Dezima, where the Dutch factory is established, was artificially constructed 
with the earth of a hill which was found near the spot, knd which was levelled for that 
purpose ; it is protected by a quay of basalt, which protects it against the water, and even 
at high tide, it is raised six feet above the level of the sea. Its length is about 600 feet, 
and its width 200. At the south and west it looks out on the sea; on the north and 
east, it faces the city of Nangasaki, from which it is separated by a canal of little width, 
and with which it communicates by means of a stone bridge, und a gate, which is always 
guarded. On this narrow spot the Dutch workmen have erected their magazines, and 
some other edifices, which form a considerably large street This establishment at 
first belonged t9 the Portuguese ; but when they were completely expelled from the em- 
pire, they fi:ave;^t yp to the Dutch, who were obliged to destroy the one they had pos- 
sessed at Piratoâ€” it being the intention of the emperor to concentrate at Nangasaki all 
the commerce of Japan. 

It was with great difficulty that they gained sufficient favor to prevent being expelled 
from this last asylum. There is no sort of vexation and humiliation that they hbve not 
been made to suffer by the Japanese authorities. But the desire of preserving a vast 
monopoly makes them bear everything. It is as humble solicitors, without suite, and 
without honors, that their ambassadors are admitted at Jeddo ; their presents are only 
received as a tribute, by which they purchase the permission to come to Japan. 

This embassy was formerly sent every year ; but in 1790, it was decided that it should 
not take place except once in four years, and that in the interval, the presents should be 
carried annually to the court by the interpreters. When the enibassy makes its visit, 
the head of the factory is allowed to take with him but two Europeans, a secretary, ana 
a physician. The journey is regulated with the greatest exactness, and in successive 
days, without their being allowed to change anything. The Japanese kept up such a 
strict guard over them that the ambassadors were not allowed to abstain from visiting 
certain curiosities, which have been shown them from time immemorial. The Japanese 
officer who was employed to conduct them, carried with him the journals of the route 
taken by his predecessors, and had recourse to it when the smallest difficulty arose. M. 
Siebold thinks, however, that by a slow and skilful course of management, it would be 
possible, by means of pecuniary sacrifices, to obtain great facilities. Unfortunately, it 
is not to be hoped that a company of merchants will consent to make very great ad- 
vances to obtain scientific and literary results that cannot be carried on their books to 
the account of profit 

The medical knowledge of our traveller had procured him numerous friends, as well 
as the means of studying thoroughly, before setting out on the journey, the manners 
and customs of the country. When the embassy started, he was perfectly prepared to 
take every advantage of the journey. 

Thanks to the custom which obliges the princes to pass alternately six months in the 
capital, and six in the provinces, and thanks to the numerous places of pilgrimage which 
are visited by the inhabitants of the most distant provinces of the empire, Japan is a coun- 
try which is travelled over with great ease. Carriages are not, however, made use of 
there : the most common means of transportation is the Nosimono, a species of palan- 
quin, to which Europeans find it hard to accommodate themselves, because they are 
obliged to keep their legs crossed in it There are at regular distances post-houses, 
where relays of bearers and beasts of burden are found ; but as a single prince employs 
often hundreds of men and animals, the post-house is only the place where travellers 
procure, under the inspection of the authorities, and with exactness, the means of con- 
tinuing their journey. There is also a letter post, which leaves the principal cities at a 
fixed day. Upon important occasions, mercantile houses send especial couriers, those 
houses particularly which deal in rice and dried fish, commodities on which they specu- 
late in Japan, as they do in Europe on cotton and the stocks. Signal fires, placed at the 
tops of the highest mountainS| give notice to the government if any important event 
occurs. 

Nangasaki is situated in 32 deg. 45 min. north latitude, and 127 deg. 31 min. 30 sec,

^story. â€” The 8udden appearance of the spirit of reforni and innovation in the Kast 
IB one of the moat lemarkable phenomena of the present century. Had this been the 
mataied fruit of time, it would cause less aurpiise. But the movement has been sudden, 
unexpected, aad to ordinary observers, inexplicable. It has not proceeded from the mass 
of the people; it is from one or two individuals that it has received its impulsion. It 



must have had, then, some accidental cause, and this cause appears to have been the 
expedition of the French into Egypt â€” an undertaking which totally failed of its imme-

Among those who came to assist m the conflict against the French, fortune had coa> 
ducted a Macedonian soldier, who was destined to evolve from that great event the 
mighty consequences which it wu to achieve upon the eastern world. This iiidividoal 
was Mehemet Ali, the Pasha of Egypt, who gained his high position in spite of a tboa- 
sand obstacles, which he either overthrew by his courage or turned aside by his address. 
It is not necessary to look upoij him as an apostle either of morality or civjUzatitHi; 
we may regard him as a man of genius, who, having learnt nothing from the societjr 
io the midst of which he was brought up, originated himself a civilizing movement. 



Wild Date Palm, 

The Sovereign is the great landholder of Egypt The peasantry stand in the relation 
toward him of a body of hired laborers ; though to some among them lands are asEiga- 
ed, of which they remain the tenants as long as they continue to pay the impost. Tha 
Pasha furnishes the implements of husbandry, and the cattle necessary for irrigation. 
"When the crops arc harvested, they are bought up at the prices fixed by the goTernment. 
The ordinary cullivators dispose of thi^ir products freely; that which isEold in the towns

pays a rateable duty. That which the laborer consumes himself, or sells on the spot, is 
exempt 

Revenuey Expenditures^ Taxes, ^c. The annual revenue of the Pasha is about 
1^12,000,000. The expenditures amount to $10,000,000. The financial means of the 
sovereign reside in three sources. First, the constitution of property in Egypt ; second, 
the monopoly of the fruits of the soil; diird, the taxes. Property in this country rests 
ui>on a basis different from what it is in Europe and America. In the oriental form of 
society, so different from ours, and in which liberty is unknown, property of any sort 
lias but a precarious existence ; the nature of it has never been so clearly^defined as in 
the West. In Egypt, from the time of the Pharaohs, the soil has always belonged to 
the sovereign. In 1808, when Mehemet Ali wrought the grand territorial revolution by 
-which he became the proprietary of nearly all Egypt, he abolished the titles to certain 
portions of land let to the fellahs or peasants, but hel^y a kind of feudal proprietors, 
of whom there were about six thousand, and thus took their property into his own hands ; 
and thus has been enabled to organize a regular system of agriculture and monopoly 
throughout the country. 

Trade and Commerce. The commerce of Egypt is carried on almost exclusively by 
folAgners ; and although the foreign trade had much declined from its ancient prosperity, 
hefore the discovery of the passage to India by the Cape of Good Hope, it is still consid- 
erable, and, under the reign of the present sovereign, is likely to receive a great and 
permanent improvement. The Egyptians import Irom Europe, woollen cloths, calico, 
muslins, handkerchiefs, silks, velvets, crape shawls, paper, fire-arms, cutlery, watches, 
clocks, glass and earthern-ware, hard- ware, planks, metal, wines and liquors ; from Asia 
Minor, carpets and figs; from Syria, tobacco, silks, woollen cloaks and soap; from 
Arabia, coffee, spices, drugs, shawls, silks and muslin ; from Abyssinia and Sennaar, 
and the neighboring countries, slaves, gold, ivory, ostrich feathers, gums and senna; 
from North Africa, woollen cloth and morocco shoes. The exports to Europe are wheat, 
maize, rice, beans, cotton, flax, indigo, coffee, spices, gums, senna, ivory and ostrich 
feathers ; to Turkey, Abyssinian and black slaves, rice, coffee, spices and henna ; to 
Syria, slaves and rice ; to Arabia, corn ; to Sennaar and the neighboring coimtries, 
cotton, linen and woollen goods, carpets, beads, soap, fire-arms, &â‚¬. 

Travelling. In one respect, the energy and severity of Mehemet All's, government 
deserve high praise; it has rendered the country under his sway secure, so that travel- 
lers, whether Orientals or Franks, may pass in their own dress throughout Egypt with 
the same degree of safety as in any part of civilized Europe or America. This was 
equally the case in Syria, and among the Bedouin Arabs of the adjacent deserts, while 
the Egyptian chief maintained his authority in that country. Travelling in Egypt, 
however, though perfectly safe, has few of the conveniences and comforts which the 
tourist has been accustomed to, who goes from England or the United States, where he 
has only to await the departure of a railroad train, a stage-coach, or a steamboat, and 
betake himself on board with bag and baggage, without further thought or care. In 
Egypt, generally speaking, are neither roads, nor public conveyances, nor public houses, 
and the traveller is thrown wholly upon his own resources. He must hire a boat upon 
the Nile for himself, unless he can nnd a companion to share it with him. He must 
provide his own bed and cooking utensik, and also his provisions for the journey, except 
such as he can procure at the villages along the Nile ; and, above all, he must have a 
servant, who can act at the same time as cook, purveyor and interpreter. He will 
soon find himself very much in the power of this important personage, who will 
usually be able neither to read nor write ; and the discomforts and vexations of this 
relation of dependance will probably continue more and more to press upon him until he 
has himself learned something of the Arabic language, or is fortunate enough to fall in 
with a companion to whom the language is familiar. If the traveller has time, he will 
do well to purchase the chief necessaries at Alexandria. Most travellers, on-arriving at 
Alexandria, suppose they have only to take a boat directly from that city along the 
canal and the Nile to Cairo; and it may be some davs before they learn that at Alfeh, 
irtiere the canal leaves the Nile, they will be compelled to hire another boat, the canal 
being there shut off from the river by a dam with sluices, but without locks. At this 
point, everything which passes between Alexandria and Cairo must be re-shipped, to the 
ipreat inconvenience of the public, and the special annoyance of travellers just arrived 
m the country. The boats on the canal and river are much the same â€” ^long, narrow 



dM EOYFTi 

and lAtarp, with m low cabih in the stent, in which one can rarely stand evect, 
usually having two low masts, with immense latine sails, their long yards taming 
the top of die mast, as an a prroi. The cabins, for the mott part, will aeeommodale enty 
two persons, to sit (cross-legged) and sleep in. If a party eonnst of more, a la^p* 
boat will be necessary, which enhances the expense andeeoMBonly adds to the length Â«f 
the Toyage. The indolence and procrastinating habits of the Eg3rptian8 anjd Anbs ais 
well known. Their maxim of Imaiiiess seems to be, " Never do to^iay whal eaa hs 
done to-morrow." 

The voyage from Cairo to Thebes is about five hundred nailes, and varies mncb as to 
time, according to the wind, but is accomplished, on the average, in about three weeka 
In mid-winter, this voyage is very interesting. The weather is usually pleaaaat, and 
the traveller is smronnded by scenes and objects lughly striking in th^nselv^es^ and 
closely associated with all that \Â§ great and venerable in the records of the aacient woridi 
The gleaming waters of the mighty river, rushing onward in oeasdess fiow â€” the pyia- 
n^ids, those mysterious monuments of gray antiquity, stretching in a ranae aiootg the 
western shore â€” ^the frequent villages along the banks, each in tbs bosom of its own lall 
gTOve of graceful palm-^trees â€” the broad valley, teeming with fertility, and shut iiuen 
both sides by ranges of naked, barren mountains, within which the desert is ccmtmiAf 
striving to enlarge its encroachments ; â€” all these are objects which cannot be reguded 
without the liveliest emotions. The many boats, with broad latine sails, gliding dawn â€” At 
frequent water-wheels by which the water is raised from the river to irrigate the fields â€” 
the peasants at work â€” the herds of neat cattle and buffiik>es â€” occasional files of eaaieb 
and as8eÂ»-*large flocks of pigeons, ducks and wild geeseâ€” crocodiles sleeping cm As 
sand-bank, and plunging into the water on the approach of the boat; â€” aU tbeeegiT^lifii 
and activity to the scene, which increase the interest of the voyase and add to tbs ex- 
hilaration. Yet if the voyager set foot on shore, the romance of his river Bav%atiMi 
will quickly be dissipated. He will find the soil becoming an almost impalpable powder 
beneath his feet, and through this he must wade his way to the next vilk^, whidi hs 
will find to be only the squalid abode of filth and wretchedness. 

The time has gone by when it was necessary for a Frank to assume the oriental drev 
in any part of Egypt. It may sometimes be convenient to do so, if he is to reside lea| 
in the country ; but in the case of the mere traveller, it now only excites the ridieole of 
the natives. A person in a Frank dress, with a long beard, they take for a Jew* Fsr 
land travelling, dromedsuries are mostly used. Camels are employed for carrying bag^ 

gage. 

The Pasha luis established two lines of dromeckay posU^ by which letters and de- 
spatches are transmitted to and from the government, as occasion may require ; and of 
which the foreign consuls ate also permitted to avail themsrtres. Between Cairo and 
Alexandria there is a regular daily line* A railroad has even been commenced to ooa- 
nect the Nile with the ]^d 8ea^ and thus to facilitate the line of travel tbrongh Egypt 
to India. 

In one point of view the innovations of the late rnler of Egypt open a cheering 
prospect. His whole line of pohcy has been obviously founded on a conviction and tacit 
acknowledgment of the superiority of European arts and arms. The disci^ine ef his 
troops, the organisation of bis fleet, the estabUshment of scboois and manufacleries, have 
ail sprung itoxa this principle, and are an attempt on his part to procure, by a iio^reed pro- 
cess, advantages which can enty result from a gradual and general developmesit and 
improvement. Yet one good effect has resulted from his labors : this same ceaviction 
of European superiority has spread from the ruler \o the people, and takoi root in thek 
minds. In consequence, the strong hold of Mahometan prejifedice and contempt towmids 
European Christians is fast breaking down and vanishing away. From ti^ exmnple 
of Egypt, a similar conviction has been forced upon the rnker of the Turkic easpire) and 
the like effects are rapidly developing themselves in his dominione. Even now, FrimkB, 
in their own dress, may wander through the streets of Constantinoi^e and other orieBttd 
cities, aaf freely as m London or Paris, without hindraiice or molestaticm, where, fifteen 

?*ears ago, they would have hes&a followed with insults and curses, and poAaps sleMd. 
f they travel in the interior, ^ey are everywhere received with coortesy, aM xamtikf 
with kindness. A still more important consequence ef this state of things ims beao, dMit 
the Eg3rptian government, and recently Aat of Turkey also, have piMed their naSinra 
CAmstian subjects on an efaal feoting with the MabometMuv ae to ctvii Drifts atfl 



tistiee, and have doti^ ft^^T) ^ ^^ least fbrbidden, the heieditarjr Md wantett eppieMlcfti* 
exercised by the tattet. 

All these thhfigs marfe Iknpotumt changes as having ali'eady taken place in the ori^tal 
character and feelings ; and nev causes are daily springing into operation which will 
lecessarily render these changes not only permanent, but progmMive. The intMluctbn 
if stesm navigettion in the Levant, and on the Nile and Black Sea, is bringing the power 
)f European civifiaatioa Into closer contact with the East, and cannot but augment itt 
nfluence a thousand fcrid. Already the oriental churches are beginning to awuke from 
;heir slumber, and Ae whole fitbtte of Mahometan prejudice and s^itierstition is sapped 
md tottering to its &11. In all human probability, the coming generation will behold 
immaiBe chmges and revdntnmB in the oriental world. Then may the Egyptian people 
M freed from the oppressions under which they ik>w groan : â€” a bondage more galling 
than that inflicted by their anceston upon the Jews of oldÂ« Th^i may Bgypt cease to 
be, what she has long been, *' the bsisest of kingdoms." 

ArekiUcture. Yery few large or handsome houses are to be seen in Egypt, except in 
Grairo and some other large towns. The dwellings of the lower order are of a very mean 
lescription. They are mostly of unbaked bricks, cemented with mud. The creator 
ftumber contain two or more apartments, but few are two stories high. In one of these 
itpartments, in the houses of the peasants in lower Egypt, there is generally an oven occu^ 
pying the whole widdt of the room. It r^semUes a wide bench or seat, and is about 
breast high. The inhabitants of the house, who seldom have any night covering, during 
winter, sleep upon the top of the oven. The chambers have small apertures, high in the 
wall, for the admission of littfat and air. The roofs are made oi palm-'branches and 
leaves, or millet stalks covered with a plaster of mud and chopped straw. 

In Cairo, the houses teee built of stone and brick, with die tronts of the lower story 
{minted in stripes of red and white. The appear story projects into the street, and as th^ 
streets are very narrow, the windows omn nearly meet each other, almost ^tirety 
exduding the sun from below ; and thus producing an a^eeable coolness in the summer 
months. The roofs are flat and covered witfi plaster. The ground-floor apartments on 
the street l^ave small wooden, grated windows, so high as to render it impossible for the 
passengers in the street to see through then, even on horseback. The houses are, in 
geaeral, two or three stories high ; and almost every house that is suffloi^tly large, 
encloses an opoi, unpaved court, which is entered by a passage with one or two turnings^ 
to prevent passengers in the street from seeing into it The principal apartments look 
into this court, and here is a well^ fountain, du^. In the ptan of the interior of almost 
every house, there is an utter want of regularity. The aparttnents are generalhr <m dif* 
ferent levels, so that a person must ascend or descend two or more st^pe to pass from one 
ohamber to the next The prineipal aim of the architect is to render the house as private 
as possible, partieulaYly that part inhabited by the women ; and not to make any window 
in such a situation as to overlook the apartmmte of anotiier house. Anothi^ object of 
the architect, in bmldkig a house for a person of wealth or rank, is to make a secret door 
from which the occupant may make his eacBfe from arrest or assassination* It is also 
common to make a hiding-place for treasure. The harem, or women's apartment, is in 
the .upper story. Many of the rooms sure painted with gaudy colors on the walls and 
ceiling, and sometimes gilt Colored glass windows are not uncommon. 

ArUilqtiiiies. Within a few years the researches of European travellers and scholars 
have thrown a flood of light upon the subject of Egyptian antiquities, which renders the 
suhjeet at pres^it one of the most interesting that can engage the attention of the stud^it 
of history. Not -only has the key to the hitherto inex^icable hieroglyj^ics been dis^ 
covered, but the most extraordincury developments have been brought to light by means 
of the innumerable paintings with which the interior walls of the Egyptian tombs and 
catacombs are covemL These paintings^ executed thousands of years ago, still exist in 
their original freshness and aceuracy ; and great multitudes of them have been copied 
and pablished in Europe with explanations. They represent all the scenes of Egyptiw 
lifei and frimish us with nmre ample and minute details of the public and private occu^ 
patlons of this most atieient people than we possess of the Greeks and Romans. Pompeii 
and Herculaneum do not give so extensive or varied a view of. the every-day business of 
the Romans, as the catacombs of Egypt do of that primeval people. In these anciei^ 
receptacles of the dead, every aet of every department of life Beema to have heen carefully

che interest of their pietoree. as they evidently adhere with eloee SAAitj td the inA 
of nature. A subterranean Egypt appears thus to have come to light : the people htfe 
been revived in all their castes, in their civil, military, and religious occupations; m 
their feasts and their funerals ; in their fields and their vineyards ; in their amusemeBli 
and their labors; in their shops, farm-yards, and kitchens; by land and by water; m 
their boats and their palanquins ; in the splendid pubUc processicm, and the jmvaeytif 
the household chamli^r. There seems to have been a regular design to make these 
subterranean chambers an exact pictorial copy of the real world aboTC. 

In these pictures we observe, first, the agricultural employment of the EgyptiaaL 
The process of sowing and of treading in the grain by the feet of beasts, as described hf 
Herodotus and Diodorus, is distinctly represented. Two men are standing with apraiKd 
whips to drive a herd of cattle over a field that has just been sown. The harvest fol- 
lows; the treading out the corn by the unmuzzled ox, according to the law in Deutenmomf: 
the storing it away in vast magazines ; while the intmdant or steward sits at his desk 
taking account of the sacks as they are carried up into the granaries. Then follows the 
vintage scene, which is curious, as finally deciding the question which arose out of 
Herodotus, as to the cuhivation of the vine in Egypt. The whole process is represoited, 
â€” the gathering the grapes, the wine-press, the pouring it into vats, and storing it a way a 
large jars. The other harvests are those of flax, the doura, and the papyrus, the gather- 
ing of figs and other fruits. In the latter, the peasants are assisted by some monkeys 
whimsically perched on the trees. 

Next follows the care and breeding of domestic animals. We have the whole bistmy 
of Pharaoh's kine, â€” they are conmionly the fat, and not the lean ones : we see the bolh 
fighting, the men milking the cows, &o. &c, every step of the process, down to the 
slaughter-house. From one picture, it appears that the Egyptian monarch, were henov 
living, might be a competitor at the Brighton cattle-show : â€” ^we find the '^ kmg's ox," 
marked No. 86 ! In another painting, we have a regular cattle-show with ox^, goats, 
sheep, &o., with a farmer surveying ami noting down the number of his cattle. In others, 
we se^ cattle-doctors administering medicine to the bull, the gazelle, the goat, and ^rea 
the goose. It is curious enough that the symbol which designates a physician of any 
class, is that well-known water-fowl whose <Â»dinary cry is '^ quack^^ â€” ^a fact which mast 
amuse, if it does not edify, the etymologist In one picture a rude plough is drawn by 
two cows, before one of which a calf is cutting capers, not wi&out some comic expiession. 
Next we have the chase in all its forms, and the different birds, quadrupeds, and fidi 
often distinguished by their seversd names. The birds 9X% chiefly water-fowl, and are 
caught by trap-nets : the land birds are shot with the bow, or knocked down with sticks. 
The coloring of the birds is most splendid. The quadrupeds hunted, are wolves, jackak 
antelopes, foxes, hares, and gazelles. In one hunting-piece, the painter has represented 
a grand baitue of bulls, buffalo, deer, wolves, foxes, hares, and porcupines, wifli tfaiee 
great swans, which defend themselves against the dogs. The other quadrupeds found 
in th^ painting, are lions, tigers, monkeys, cats, mice, the elephant, rhinoceros, and gira&. 
We have also the whole process of catching and salting fish, delineated with the atmost 
distinctnesa 

The exhibitions of the mechanical arts are no less curious and interesting. In weaving; 
we behold the process from the beating of the flax and winding of the thread, throngb 
the loom, to the perfect cloth. Next ^e are introduced into the carpenter's shop, wiieiv 
we follow with the same regularity the whole course of the work, from cuttmg down 
and cleaving the tree, till it is formed into pikes or arrows, hewn into a boat, or wrought 
into chairs or carriages. The wheelwright is busy in forming his circles and apokes. 
We are next admitt^ into the studios of the painters and sculptors (^ the court of Pha- 
raoh. The painters are chiefly at work in ornamenting mummy cases. The sculptors 
are hewing out, one a lioness, another a sphynx, and others huge c(dossal idols, or ni& 
human ^ap^s. In one picture there is an extraordinary sort of procession, in wbieb 
hundreds of men are dragging along by main strength a vast idol on a kind of sledge. 
A priest, who looks like a Lilliputian mounted on Gulliver's knee, is addressing the 
multitude; a second is making an offering ; a third pouring forth a libation. One picture, 
of very high interest, repreamts brick-making, in which the labor^s are supposed to be 
Jews : their countenances are certainly Asiatic and not Egyptian, and many obserreff 
have imagined that they could recognise the keen dark eye, the sharp line of feature^ 
and other characteristic marks which distinguish the childreil of IsraeL

' Iha Hebrew history has reoehrad some remarkable confirmations from these discoveries. 
Besides what we have already mentioned, an effigy of one of the Egyptian kings, named 
Sheshonk, (^lishak,) has been found, coupled wiUi the name of loudaha Malek â€” ^the kmg 
of the Jews. 

The ffoldsmiths and silversmiths next appear, weighing, melting, and refining gold, 
and gilding small statues : others are making necklaces, apparently of colored glass. 
Domestic manufactures, too numerous to describe here, are also represented with the 
most minute accuracy, as shoe-making, tailoring, &c. Females are emploved in dis- 
tilling the essence of flowers, &c. We proceed now to the representations of"^ a mansion 
of an Egyptian of rank, possibly the royal palace, where we are admitted to the private 
chambers of the females, ornamented in the most sumptuous manner, opening upon a 
garden, and supported by slender pillars with lotus capitals, which have a singular Indian 
appearance. In the garden, four square fish-ponds are marked by rows of water-fowl, 
and the avenues of trees are trimmed into a rounded form. The vineyard is in the 
centre, trained in graceful festoons. In the saloons, the furniture resembles in elegance 
that of an European drawing-room, â€” stools, chairs, ottomans, and couches. From Uie 
aaloon, we ascend to the royal bed-chamber, where the Pharaoh reposed on a couch 
without curtains, but ornamented with what appear to be candelabra on each side. 
Theare is a wardrobe, as like a modern one as can be. A tig^s skin is spread out for a 
carpet His majesty has arisen, and the toilet be^ns. There stands the barber, â€” and a. 
formidable weapon he wields, â€” performing his office upon the royal head. The valets 
approach with the robes, the collars, the girdle, and the bow. Her majestjr's ladies of 
the bed-chamber are likewise in waiting with the female paraphernalia. 

Not the least interesting of these delineations, are a kitchen scene, and a dinner party. 
The former begins with the slaughter of the animals. They are skinned and cut up. 
The geese and other fowl flutter in the hands of the poulterers. The lambs are carried 
along in baskets like English milk-pails. The ox is bleeding his life away into a pitcher. 
The cooks hang their pots over the fire, and flourish their flesh-hooks for business. Oi^p 
of them is peeling leeks for sauce. The guests are arrayed at the table in separate groups : 
one only is seated on a kind of chair ; the rest sit with their legs straight under them. 
Servants are waiting, and wine and other refreshments are brought in. It is evidently 
not a temperance festival, for the ladies give such unequivocal proofs of the potency of the 
liquor, that no one can misunderstand them. Knives and forks do not appear. Next 
come music and dancing : harps with six, nine, ten, or twelve strings ; wind instruments 
of great diversities of form; ancient Fanny EUsslers, displaying their elegant shapes and 
grotesque figures, performing a sort of masquerade. Wrestlers are next seen in every 
possible distortion of form, female tumblers, &c. &c. 

There are water-pieces, with boats sailing and rowing. The rowers present a curious 
spectacle ; they stand in rows, sometimes one above the other. In some of the sailing- 
boats, with their chequered sails, we catch a resemblance to the boats and mat-sails of 
the South-Sea Isl^ders. One or two of the more splendid barks realize the description 
of the barge of Cleopatra. 

In the paintings of a more lofty subject, we see Pharaoh on his throne, surrounded by 
his court, or in company with his wives, some of whom ofler him flowers, or wave before 
him fans or fly-flaps. A favorite is invited to divert his leisure hours with a game similar 
to chess. The women all stand in his presence ; the\in^ alone is seated in an elegant 
arm-chair. In another painting is a grand processiim of Ethiopian and Asiatic chiefs 
bearing a tribute to the Egyptian monarch, Thotmes UI. They are arranged in five 
lines : the first consists of blacks, or red men, who bong ivory, apes, leopards, skins, and 
dried fruits. In the second line, are a people of light-red hue, with long black hair 
descending in ringlets over their shoulders, but wimout beards. They wear a short 
dress and sandals richly worked : their presents are vases of elegant form, ornamented 
with flowers, necklaces, and other costly gifts, which, according to the hierogljrphical 
inscriptions, they bring as '^ chosen oflenngs of the chiefs of the Gentiles of Kufa.^' In 
the third line are Ethiopians, who are styl^ '^ Gentiles of the South." The leaders are 
drcv^ed in the Egyptian costume; the others have a girdle of stdn, with the hair outwards. 
They bring sold rings, skins, apes, leopards, ebony, ivory, ostrich-eggs, and plumes, a 
giraffe, hounds with collars, and a drove of long-homed oxen. The fourth line is com- 
posed of men of a white nation, clad in long white garments, with a blue border, tied at 
the neck and ornamented with a cross and other devices. On the head is either a close 

34 



cap or (heir natural hair, short, and of a r^ cotor, and they have a small beard. Sns 
bring long gloves, which, with their close sleeves, indicate, as -well as their cempkiiGi^ 
<hat they are the inhabitants of a cold climate. AmoM other offerings are vases, siiste 
to those of the Kufa, a chariot ;and horses, a bear, eleptumt, and ivory. In the Mk 
line the Egyptians lead the van, and are follovT^ed by women of Ethiopia. The oier- 
mgs being placed in the presence of the monarch, an inventory is taken of them bf 
Egjrptian scribes. In another painting, a battle-piece, a town named Kcmema mem 
to make its submission ; and, a still more curious circumstance, in anotfaer, Ae fljag 
enemy take refuge among the lofty cedars that crown the heights of their moimtttBsiii 
country. The name of the people is Limanotiy but the snbsticttion of m for b is aotojf 
Common as to allow us to conjecture that it should be LHaMn. 

There are matiy other battle-pieces, representing the wars and conquests of dtfanit 
races of kings. Their images are painted on the walls, graven on the bas^reli^ aai 
represented in the colossal statues ; they affbrd a great parttaU-galkry of tfie Phaniti 
of Egypt, upon which we look wi^ the most intense interest and wonder. The variel) 
fai feature and expression of character in these representations, warrants ns in pmno uK- 
ing them, in the strictest sense of the word, portraits, lliey present ahnost erciy 

fradation of outline, from the low, receding brow, thick lips, and flattish nose ti die 
Ethiopian, to an Asiatic, if not Grecian symmetry of ^raiture ; and in one, vre find fa 
high-arched Roman nose. Nof are we without specimess of royal female beanty. Has 
series extends, though broken by many intervals, from Ae Ediiopian wife of die fnt 
Amenoph, the head of the 18th dynasty, whose features are the nearest to the negieif 
the whole number, down to the identical Cleopatra ckT classic story. The portrait of Aii 
famous queen has a voluptuous fulness, but without extraordfaiary beauty, correspondi^ 
precisely to the description of Plutarch. 

The numerous battle-pieces, the representations of combats by sea and land, of fliepi, 
triumphs, processions of captives, the cruel mutilations on which the nnmber of &e 
Vanquished is reckoned by the heads cut off, and by ottier more barbarous mntilatinit, 
common in eastern warfare â€” the single figures of Ae heroes in die great conflicts, pv- 
ticularly a remarkable one of the conqueror with his limi, which peipetually oe 
all these most clearly prove that the ancient Egyptians were a warlike nation, said 
distinguished among their contemporaries by great military prowess. 

This singular propensity of the Egyptians, to decorate the tombs of the dead with Ae 
lavish splendor which other nations have reserved 4br the palaces and temples of tke 
living, is one of the most remarkable and inexplicable of all the phenom^Mt in the 
History of man. Many of these higbly^adomed sepulchfes appear to be accessible ealy 
throueh long, narrow, and intricate passages; the approach to others seems to have beet 
closed with the strictest care, and ccmcealed with a kind of reverential sanctity. Each 
city, or at least each district, had its catacombs, or ^' city of the dead." In the siknt 
and rock-hewn counterpart or Memphis and Thebes were treasured up all the scenes si 
which the living king and his subject had been engaged. The royal tombs were a kisd 
of mimic palaces, with halls and corridors, and galleries, in regular successicMi, oil they 
reached the chamber of state in which the sarcophagus rq[>06ed. The sepnidnal 
chambers of the Theban necropolis are by far the most spacions and magnificent of d; 
but those of Beni Hassan appear to furnish the most curious ilhistrations of comiMtt 
life. It is here that the trades, manufactures and agricultural occupations are d^Mted 
in regular compartments. The principle of devoting so much cost and toil to the eiw- 
tasting palaces of departed monarchs, which probably gave rise to the ccHistiaction of 
the pyramids, once admitted, the decorations of the walls with religious processions, er 
with painted legends of the glory of the deceased, may seem less inexplicable. But then 
is something unaccoimtable in this delineation of every occupation of life, in the baU- 
tations of the dead. If the paintings were merely intended to designate the rank, tte 
profession, the occupation ojt the deceasedâ€” the warlike scenes in the tomb of ndlitarf 
caste, scenes of rural labor in that of the husbandman-â€” Iheir purport would be evident 
But some of the tombs are decorated with every kind of deviee ; so that the paintisgi 
are no way emblematical of the peculiar character or history of the deceased. Till 
whole subject is a profound and impenetrable mystery ; yet these things conld turn 
have been without a motive and i^)ecific design ; and under aS this mystery, we M 
persuaded, must lie some profound meaning, wmch neither modem research nor ceqeo* 
tors has been able to approach.

lA^rututB ani Science. The nMiropolis of Egypt mamtains the reputation, Dy wMdi 
it has been distinguished for many centuries, of being ihe best school of Arabic literature 
and of Mahometan theology and jurisprudence. Polite learning has much declined 
among the Arabs g^:ieraUy, but least in Cairo. Consequendy, the fame of the professors 
of this city still remains unriralled ; and its great mosque, the Azhar, continues to a:^ 
tract crowds of students fran every quarter oi the Moslem workL The Arabic spoken 
by the highw and middle classes in C^iro, is generally inferior, in point of grammaticsl 
eorrectness and pronunciation, to the dialect of the Bedouins of Arabia^ and of the 
inhabitants of the towns in their immediate yidni^. But it is far superior to that of 
Syria, and still more to the dialects of 4he Western Arabs. There is not so great a di& 
ference among the dialects of Arabia spoken in difEsrent countries, as is commonly 
imagined. Tbey resemble each other more than the dialects of some of the different 
counties in England. The literature of the Arabs is very comprehensive. The greater 
portion of the books r^te to religkm and jurisprudence ; next are diose on grammar, 
rhetoric, and philology ; next, are works of history and geography ; next, poetry sold 
lomanca. Works on chemistry, medicine, the mathematics, algebra, &â‚¬., are eom^ 
paratively few. 

There are in Cairo, many large libraries, most of which are attached to mosques, and 
conmst, for die most part, of works on theology, jurisprudence and philology. Several 
tioh merchants and otfiers have also good libraries ; but the book-stores m Cairo are 
only eight or ten, and they are but ill^ocked. Whenever a valuable book c<Hnes into 
the possession of one of these persons, he goes round with it to his regular customeaoBL 
and is almost sure of finding a purchaser. The leaves of books are seldom sewed 
together, but they are usually enclosed in a cover bound with leather. Five sheets or 
double leaves are commonly tdaMoed together, one within another. The leaves are thus 
arranged in small parcels without being sewed, in order that one book may be of use to 
a number of p^sons at the same time. 

The young men who design to devote themselves to religious employments, or to aqy 
of the learned professions, mostly pursue a course of study in the Great Mosque, having 
previously learned nothing niote than to read, and perhaps to write and recite the Koran, 
ochods are very numerousy not only in the metropolis, but in every large town, and 
there is at least one in every considerable village. Almost every mosque in the metropolis 
baa a school, in which children are instructed at a very trifling expense, the schoolmaster 
receiving from the parent of ea^ pupil about two cents and a half every Thursday* 
The lessons are ^nerally written on tablets of wood pjainted white. All who are learn* 
ing to read, recite their lessens aloud^ rocking their heads and bodies incessantly 
backward and forward, which practice is observed by almost all persons in reading the 
Koran, it being thought to assist memory. The noise may be imagined. It is seldom 
that the master of a school teaches writing ; few boys learn it, unless destined for some 
employment in which it is iadispensable^ The schoolmasters are mostly persons of 
small learning. 

The regular subjects of study at the Great Mosque, are grammar, rhetoric, versifica- 
tion, logic, theology, jurisprudence, and arithmetic Lectures are also given on algebra. 
None of the students pay for tiie instruction they receive, being mostly of the poorer 
classes. The greater part af those who do not belong to the city, receive a daily alk>w- 
ance of food, provided from funds chiefly ariÂ»ng from the rent ol houses bequeathed for 
that purpose. The expense (^ repairs mr the mosque^ and the salaries of the instruc- 
tors are paid by the govemmeirt The number of students is at present about fifteen 
hundred. There is also a chapel, in which three hundred poor blind men are main- 
tained, most of whom are students. These men are notorious for their fanaticism, and 
sometimes behave most ouitrageously. The literary attainments <^ those who do not 
belong to the learned classes, are q( an inferior kind. Many of the wealthy trades-peo- 
ple are well instructed in reading and writing, but few of them devote much time to the 
Eursuit of Uterature. Many trs^esmen can neither read nor write, and are obliged to 
ave recourse to friends to write their accounts and letters ; but the same persons gener- 
ally cast accounts and make intricate calculations mentally, with surprising rapidity 
and correctness. The medical and snrgioal practitioners are mostly barbers, miserably 
ignorant of the sciences which they profess, and unskilful in their practice, partly in 
consequence of being prohibited by their religion from dissecting human bodies. Bnt 
numbers of young men, natives of Egypt, are now receiving European instruction in 



Â«88 EGYPT 

medicine, anatomy, surgery, and other sciences, for the service of government. AkbjEf 
is more studied in this country than pure chemistry, and astrology more than aBtroooaj. 
The astrolabe and quadrant are almost the only astronomical instruments used in Bgrfi 
Telescopes are rarely seen, and the magnetic needle seldom employed, except to disom 
the situation of Mecca. The Pasha has a printing-office at Boolak, a suburb of Cain. 
at which more than a hundred different works have been printed, most of them for ibt 
use of the military, naval and civil servants of the government A pocket aimiiiHif â–  
published annually. 

Army and Navy. Mehemet Ali, after exterminating the Mamelukes, saw that u 
maintain his power, an army was necessary, â€” not an army after the Turkish fadnoo. a 
turbulent militia, dangerous even to the sovereign that commands it and the people wfao 
pay it ; â€” ^but an army subjected to the rigor of strict discipline^ that would submit t& 
the rules of military science and insure success in the field. For this purpose he hts 
organized an army on the European system, and under the tuition of European officen 
His military forces amoimt to 130,402 regular troops and 47,678 irregulars. Besides ttoe 
there are 47,800 national guards. French officers are almost the only ones emplofed 
in the formation of the corps o^ infantry and cavalry. 

The Egyptian fleet was entirely destroyed at the battle of Navarino ; it was, howercr, 
but small. Since then a new naval force has been organized imder the superinteodeoce 
of Europeans. The first ship 6f one hundred guns, was laimched at Alexandria ii 
1831. At present the navy consists of 11 ships of the line, 7 frigates, 6 corvettes, 4 
schooners and 5 brigs, carrying an effective force of 16,000 men. 

It is a remarkable fact in the history of this country, that the army and the numerow 
appendages connected with it, have been the means of introducing into Egypt the great 
social reforms and political improvements which are now in progress there. Followi^ 
close upon the organization of the army and fleet, have come the establishments for pul& 
instruction, schools, hospitals and other European and civilizing institutions. 

.Population and Inhabitants. The present population of Egypt is about 3,000,000, d 
whom 2,600,000 are Egyptian Mahometans, 160,000 Copts, 12,000 Turks, 70,000 
Bedouin Arabs, 25,000 Ethiopians and other blacks, 6,000 Abyssinians, 6,000 Circas- 
sian and Georgian slaves, 7,000 Jews, 7,000 Syrians and Arminians, 2,000 Italians, ^ 
French, and 100 English. 

The Copts are descendants of the ancient Egyptians, but not an unmixed race, tfaek 
ancestors, in the early ages of Christianitv, having intermarried with Greeks, Nubians, 
and Abyssinians. They diflfer but little from their Moslem countrymen. In religion, 
they are, with the exception of a small number who profess the Romish or Greek faith. 
Christians of the ancient sect called Jacobites, Eutychians, Monophy sites and Monothe- 
lites. The Copts have numerous schools, but for boys only. Very few females amoog 
them can read, and those are instructed at home. The boys are taught the Psalms of 
David, the Gospels, the Apostolical Epistles in Arabic, and then the Gospels and Epistles 
in Coptic. The Scriptures are read in their churches also in that language, but thej 
are explained from books in Arabic. The Copts generally pray seven times a day. Jb 
to their general standing and character, they are not now despised and degraded by the 
government as they were a few years ago. Some of them have even been raised to the 
rank of Beys. Before the accession of Mehemet Ali, neither the Copts, nor the other eastern 
Christians, nor Jews were allowed to ride horses in Egypt ; but this restriction is nov 
abolished. The Copts are not liable to be taken for military service, â€” an immunity 
which excites the envy of their Moslem neighbors. They are not allowed by their 
church to intermarry with other sects. They are great bigots, and bitterly hate all 
other Christians. They are of a sullen temper, avaricious and deceitful. Most of the 
Copts in Cairo are accountants or tradesmen. Those in the villages are employed in 
agriculture. The male adults pay a tribute to the .government besides the uniyersal 
income tax. 

The Jews in Egypt lead a very quiet life. They have eight synagogues in Cairo, 
and enjoy not only religious toleration, but a greater freedom irom oppression than their 
race experience in any other part of the Turkish empire. They pay tribute like the 
Copts, and are exempted from military service. Many of them are bankers, goldsmiths, 
silversmiths and merchants, but the lower orders are poor and wretched. The whole 
class, indeed, make a very shabby appearance^ for the more opulent individuals care- 
fully conceal their wealth.

I. The Absence of Mr Glass


THE consulting-rooms of Dr Orion Hood, the eminent criminologist
and specialist in certain moral disorders, lay along the sea-front
at Scarborough, in a series of very large and well-lighted french windows,
which showed the North Sea like one endless outer wall of blue-green marble.
In such a place the sea had something of the monotony of a blue-green dado:
for the chambers themselves were ruled throughout by a terrible tidiness
not unlike the terrible tidiness of the sea.  It must not be supposed
that Dr Hood's apartments excluded luxury, or even poetry.
These things were there, in their place; but one felt that
they were never allowed out of their place.  Luxury was there:
there stood upon a special table eight or ten boxes of the best cigars;
but they were built upon a plan so that the strongest were always
nearest the wall and the mildest nearest the window.  A tantalus
containing three kinds of spirit, all of a liqueur excellence,
stood always on this table of luxury; but the fanciful have asserted
that the whisky, brandy, and rum seemed always to stand at the same level.
Poetry was there:  the left-hand corner of the room was lined with
as complete a set of English classics as the right hand could show
of English and foreign physiologists.  But if one took a volume
of Chaucer or Shelley from that rank, its absence irritated the mind
like a gap in a man's front teeth.  One could not say the books
were never read; probably they were, but there was a sense of their
being chained to their places, like the Bibles in the old churches.
Dr Hood treated his private book-shelf as if it were a public library.
And if this strict scientific intangibility steeped even the shelves
laden with lyrics and ballads and the tables laden with drink and tobacco,
it goes without saying that yet more of such heathen holiness
protected the other shelves that held the specialist's library,
and the other tables that sustained the frail and even fairylike
instruments of chemistry or mechanics.

     Dr Hood paced the length of his string of apartments, bounded--
as the boys' geographies say--on the east by the North Sea and on the west
by the serried ranks of his sociological and criminologist library.
He was clad in an artist's velvet, but with none of an artist's negligence;
his hair was heavily shot with grey, but growing thick and healthy;
his face was lean, but sanguine and expectant.  Everything about him
and his room indicated something at once rigid and restless,
like that great northern sea by which (on pure principles of hygiene)
he had built his home.

     Fate, being in a funny mood, pushed the door open and
introduced into those long, strict, sea-flanked apartments
one who was perhaps the most startling opposite of them and their master.
In answer to a curt but civil summons, the door opened inwards
and there shambled into the room a shapeless little figure,
which seemed to find its own hat and umbrella as unmanageable as
a mass of luggage.  The umbrella was a black and prosaic bundle
long past repair; the hat was a broad-curved black hat, clerical
but not common in England; the man was the very embodiment of all
that is homely and helpless.

     The doctor regarded the new-comer with a restrained astonishment,
not unlike that he would have shown if some huge but obviously
harmless sea-beast had crawled into his room.  The new-comer
regarded the doctor with that beaming but breathless geniality
which characterizes a corpulent charwoman who has just managed
to stuff herself into an omnibus.  It is a rich confusion of
social self-congratulation and bodily disarray.  His hat tumbled
to the carpet, his heavy umbrella slipped between his knees with a thud;
he reached after the one and ducked after the other, but with
an unimpaired smile on his round face spoke simultaneously as follows:

     "My name is Brown.  Pray excuse me.  I've come about
that business of the MacNabs.  I have heard, you often help people
out of such troubles.  Pray excuse me if I am wrong."

     By this time he had sprawlingly recovered the hat, and made
an odd little bobbing bow over it, as if setting everything quite right.

     "I hardly understand you," replied the scientist, with
a cold intensity of manner.  "I fear you have mistaken the chambers.
I am Dr Hood, and my work is almost entirely literary and educational.
It is true that I have sometimes been consulted by the police
in cases of peculiar difficulty and importance, but--"

     "Oh, this is of the greatest importance," broke in the little man
called Brown.  "Why, her mother won't let them get engaged."
And he leaned back in his chair in radiant rationality.

     The brows of Dr Hood were drawn down darkly, but the eyes
under them were bright with something that might be anger or
might be amusement.  "And still," he said, "I do not quite understand."

     "You see, they want to get married," said the man with the
clerical hat.  "Maggie MacNab and young Todhunter want to get married.
Now, what can be more important than that?"

     The great Orion Hood's scientific triumphs had deprived him
of many things--some said of his health, others of his God;
but they had not wholly despoiled him of his sense of the absurd.
At the last plea of the ingenuous priest a chuckle broke out of him
from inside, and he threw himself into an arm-chair in an ironical attitude
of the consulting physician.

     "Mr Brown," he said gravely, "it is quite fourteen and a half years
since I was personally asked to test a personal problem: then it was
the case of an attempt to poison the French President at
a Lord Mayor's Banquet.  It is now, I understand, a question of whether
some friend of yours called Maggie is a suitable fiancee for some friend
of hers called Todhunter.  Well, Mr Brown, I am a sportsman.
I will take it on.  I will give the MacNab family my best advice,
as good as I gave the French Republic and the King of England--no, better:
fourteen years better.  I have nothing else to do this afternoon.
Tell me your story."

     The little clergyman called Brown thanked him with
unquestionable warmth, but still with a queer kind of simplicity.
It was rather as if he were thanking a stranger in a smoking-room
for some trouble in passing the matches, than as if he were (as he was)
practically thanking the Curator of Kew Gardens for coming with him
into a field to find a four-leaved clover.  With scarcely a semi-colon
after his hearty thanks, the little man began his recital:

     "I told you my name was Brown; well, that's the fact,
and I'm the priest of the little Catholic Church I dare say you've seen
beyond those straggly streets, where the town ends towards the north.
In the last and straggliest of those streets which runs along the sea
like a sea-wall there is a very honest but rather sharp-tempered
member of my flock, a widow called MacNab.  She has one daughter,
and she lets lodgings, and between her and the daughter,
and between her and the lodgers--well, I dare say there is a great deal
to be said on both sides.  At present she has only one lodger,
the young man called Todhunter; but he has given more trouble
than all the rest, for he wants to marry the young woman of the house."

     "And the young woman of the house," asked Dr Hood, with huge and
silent amusement, "what does she want?"

     "Why, she wants to marry him," cried Father Brown, sitting up eagerly.
"That is just the awful complication."

     "It is indeed a hideous enigma," said Dr Hood.

     "This young James Todhunter," continued the cleric,
"is a very decent man so far as I know; but then nobody knows very much.
He is a bright, brownish little fellow, agile like a monkey,
clean-shaven like an actor, and obliging like a born courtier.
He seems to have quite a pocketful of money, but nobody knows what
his trade is.  Mrs MacNab, therefore (being of a pessimistic turn),
is quite sure it is something dreadful, and probably connected with dynamite.
The dynamite must be of a shy and noiseless sort, for the poor fellow
only shuts himself up for several hours of the day and studies something
behind a locked door.  He declares his privacy is temporary and justified,
and promises to explain before the wedding.  That is all that anyone knows
for certain, but Mrs MacNab will tell you a great deal more than
even she is certain of.  You know how the tales grow like grass on
such a patch of ignorance as that.  There are tales of two voices
heard talking in the room; though, when the door is opened,
Todhunter is always found alone.  There are tales of a mysterious
tall man in a silk hat, who once came out of the sea-mists and
apparently out of the sea, stepping softly across the sandy fields and
through the small back garden at twilight, till he was heard
talking to the lodger at his open window.  The colloquy seemed to end
in a quarrel.  Todhunter dashed down his window with violence,
and the man in the high hat melted into the sea-fog again.
This story is told by the family with the fiercest mystification;
but I really think Mrs MacNab prefers her own original tale:
that the Other Man (or whatever it is) crawls out every night from the
big box in the corner, which is kept locked all day.  You see,
therefore, how this sealed door of Todhunter's is treated as the gate
of all the fancies and monstrosities of the `Thousand and One Nights'.
And yet there is the little fellow in his respectable black jacket,
as punctual and innocent as a parlour clock.  He pays his rent to the tick;
he is practically a teetotaller; he is tirelessly kind with
the younger children, and can keep them amused for a day on end; and,
last and most urgent of all, he has made himself equally popular with
the eldest daughter, who is ready to go to church with him tomorrow."

     A man warmly concerned with any large theories has always
a relish for applying them to any triviality.  The great specialist
having condescended to the priest's simplicity, condescended expansively.
He settled himself with comfort in his arm-chair and began to talk in
the tone of a somewhat absent-minded lecturer:

     "Even in a minute instance, it is best to look first to
the main tendencies of Nature.  A particular flower may not be dead
in early winter, but the flowers are dying; a particular pebble
may never be wetted with the tide, but the tide is coming in.
To the scientific eye all human history is a series of collective movements,
destructions or migrations, like the massacre of flies in winter
or the return of birds in spring.  Now the root fact in all history is Race.
Race produces religion; Race produces legal and ethical wars.
There is no stronger case than that of the wild, unworldly and
perishing stock which we commonly call the Celts, of whom your friends
the MacNabs are specimens.  Small, swarthy, and of this dreamy and
drifting blood, they accept easily the superstitious explanation of
any incidents, just as they still accept (you will excuse me for saying)
that superstitious explanation of all incidents which you
and your Church represent.  It is not remarkable that such people,
with the sea moaning behind them and the Church (excuse me again)
droning in front of them, should put fantastic features into what are
probably plain events.  You, with your small parochial responsibilities,
see only this particular Mrs MacNab, terrified with this particular tale
of two voices and a tall man out of the sea.  But the man with
the scientific imagination sees, as it were, the whole clans of MacNab
scattered over the whole world, in its ultimate average as uniform
as a tribe of birds.  He sees thousands of Mrs MacNabs,
in thousands of houses, dropping their little drop of morbidity
in the tea-cups of their friends; he sees--"

     Before the scientist could conclude his sentence, another and
more impatient summons sounded from without; someone with swishing skirts
was marshalled hurriedly down the corridor, and the door opened on
a young girl, decently dressed but disordered and red-hot with haste.
She had sea-blown blonde hair, and would have been entirely beautiful
if her cheek-bones had not been, in the Scotch manner, a little
high in relief as well as in colour.  Her apology was almost as abrupt
as a command.

     "I'm sorry to interrupt you, sir," she said, "but I had to follow
Father Brown at once; it's nothing less than life or death."

     Father Brown began to get to his feet in some disorder.
"Why, what has happened, Maggie?" he said.

     "James has been murdered, for all I can make out,"
answered the girl, still breathing hard from her rush.  "That man Glass
has been with him again; I heard them talking through the door quite plain.
Two separate voices:  for James speaks low, with a burr,
and the other voice was high and quavery."

     "That man Glass?" repeated the priest in some perplexity.

     "I know his name is Glass," answered the girl, in great impatience.
"I heard it through the door.  They were quarrelling--about money,
I think--for I heard James say again and again, `That's right, Mr Glass,'
or `No, Mr Glass,' and then, `Two or three, Mr Glass.'  But we're talking
too much; you must come at once, and there may be time yet."

     "But time for what?" asked Dr Hood, who had been studying
the young lady with marked interest.  "What is there about Mr Glass
and his money troubles that should impel such urgency?"

     "I tried to break down the door and couldn't," answered the girl shortly,
"Then I ran to the back-yard, and managed to climb on to the window-sill
that looks into the room.  It was an dim, and seemed to be empty,
but I swear I saw James lying huddled up in a corner, as if he were
drugged or strangled."

     "This is very serious," said Father Brown, gathering his errant hat
and umbrella and standing up; "in point of fact I was just putting
your case before this gentleman, and his view--"

     "Has been largely altered," said the scientist gravely.
"I do not think this young lady is so Celtic as I had supposed.
As I have nothing else to do, I will put on my hat and stroll
down town with you."

     In a few minutes all three were approaching the dreary tail of
the MacNabs' street:  the girl with the stern and breathless stride
of the mountaineer, the criminologist with a lounging grace (which was
not without a certain leopard-like swiftness), and the priest at an
energetic trot entirely devoid of distinction.  The aspect of this
edge of the town was not entirely without justification for
the doctor's hints about desolate moods and environments.
The scattered houses stood farther and farther apart in a broken string
along the seashore; the afternoon was closing with a premature and
partly lurid twilight; the sea was of an inky purple and murmuring ominously.
In the scrappy back garden of the MacNabs which ran down towards the sand,
two black, barren-looking trees stood up like demon hands held up
in astonishment, and as Mrs MacNab ran down the street to meet them
with lean hands similarly spread, and her fierce face in shadow,
she was a little like a demon herself.  The doctor and the priest
made scant reply to her shrill reiterations of her daughter's story,
with more disturbing details of her own, to the divided vows of vengeance
against Mr Glass for murdering, and against Mr Todhunter for being murdered,
or against the latter for having dared to want to marry her daughter,
and for not having lived to do it.  They passed through the narrow passage
in the front of the house until they came to the lodger's door at the back,
and there Dr Hood, with the trick of an old detective, put his shoulder
sharply to the panel and burst in the door.

     It opened on a scene of silent catastrophe.  No one seeing it,
even for a flash, could doubt that the room had been the theatre
of some thrilling collision between two, or perhaps more, persons.
Playing-cards lay littered across the table or fluttered about
the floor as if a game had been interrupted.  Two wine glasses stood
ready for wine on a side-table, but a third lay smashed
in a star of crystal upon the carpet.  A few feet from it lay
what looked like a long knife or short sword, straight,
but with an ornamental and pictured handle, its dull blade just caught
a grey glint from the dreary window behind, which showed the black trees
against the leaden level of the sea.  Towards the opposite corner
of the room was rolled a gentleman's silk top hat, as if it had
just been knocked off his head; so much so, indeed, that one almost looked
to see it still rolling.  And in the corner behind it, thrown like a sack
of potatoes, but corded like a railway trunk, lay Mr James Todhunter,
with a scarf across his mouth, and six or seven ropes knotted round
his elbows and ankles.  His brown eyes were alive and shifted alertly.

     Dr Orion Hood paused for one instant on the doormat and drank in
the whole scene of voiceless violence.  Then he stepped swiftly
across the carpet, picked up the tall silk hat, and gravely put it
upon the head of the yet pinioned Todhunter.  It was so much too large
for him that it almost slipped down on to his shoulders.

     "Mr Glass's hat," said the doctor, returning with it and peering
into the inside with a pocket lens.  "How to explain the absence
of Mr Glass and the presence of Mr Glass's hat?  For Mr Glass is not a
careless man with his clothes.  That hat is of a stylish shape and
systematically brushed and burnished, though not very new.
An old dandy, I should think."

     "But, good heavens!" called out Miss MacNab, "aren't you going to
untie the man first?"

     "I say `old' with intention, though not with certainty"
continued the expositor; "my reason for it might seem a little far-fetched.
The hair of human beings falls out in very varying degrees,
but almost always falls out slightly, and with the lens I should see
the tiny hairs in a hat recently worn.  It has none, which leads me
to guess that Mr Glass is bald.  Now when this is taken with
the high-pitched and querulous voice which Miss MacNab described
so vividly (patience, my dear lady, patience), when we take
the hairless head together with the tone common in senile anger,
I should think we may deduce some advance in years.  Nevertheless,
he was probably vigorous, and he was almost certainly tall.
I might rely in some degree on the story of his previous appearance
at the window, as a tall man in a silk hat, but I think I have
more exact indication.  This wineglass has been smashed all over the place,
but one of its splinters lies on the high bracket beside the mantelpiece.
No such fragment could have fallen there if the vessel had been smashed
in the hand of a comparatively short man like Mr Todhunter."

     "By the way," said Father Brown, "might it not be as well
to untie Mr Todhunter?"

     "Our lesson from the drinking-vessels does not end here,"
proceeded the specialist.  "I may say at once that it is possible
that the man Glass was bald or nervous through dissipation rather than age.
Mr Todhunter, as has been remarked, is a quiet thrifty gentleman,
essentially an abstainer.  These cards and wine-cups are no part
of his normal habit; they have been produced for a particular companion.
But, as it happens, we may go farther.  Mr Todhunter may or may not
possess this wine-service, but there is no appearance of his
possessing any wine.  What, then, were these vessels to contain?
I would at once suggest some brandy or whisky, perhaps of a luxurious sort,
from a flask in the pocket of Mr Glass.  We have thus something like
a picture of the man, or at least of the type:  tall, elderly, fashionable,
but somewhat frayed, certainly fond of play and strong waters,
perhaps rather too fond of them Mr Glass is a gentleman not unknown
on the fringes of society."

     "Look here," cried the young woman, "if you don't let me pass to
untie him I'll run outside and scream for the police."

     "I should not advise you, Miss MacNab," said Dr Hood gravely,
"to be in any hurry to fetch the police.  Father Brown,
I seriously ask you to compose your flock, for their sakes, not for mine.
Well, we have seen something of the figure and quality of Mr Glass;
what are the chief facts known of Mr Todhunter?  They are substantially three:
that he is economical, that he is more or less wealthy, and that
he has a secret.  Now, surely it is obvious that there are
the three chief marks of the kind of man who is blackmailed.
And surely it is equally obvious that the faded finery,
the profligate habits, and the shrill irritation of Mr Glass
are the unmistakable marks of the kind of man who blackmails him.
We have the two typical figures of a tragedy of hush money:
on the one hand, the respectable man with a mystery; on the other,
the West-end vulture with a scent for a mystery.  These two men
have met here today and have quarrelled, using blows and a bare weapon."

     "Are you going to take those ropes off?" asked the girl stubbornly.

     Dr Hood replaced the silk hat carefully on the side table,
and went across to the captive.  He studied him intently,
even moving him a little and half-turning him round by the shoulders,
but he only answered:

     "No; I think these ropes will do very well till your friends
the police bring the handcuffs."

     Father Brown, who had been looking dully at the carpet,
lifted his round face and said:  "What do you mean?"

     The man of science had picked up the peculiar dagger-sword
from the carpet and was examining it intently as he answered:

     "Because you find Mr Todhunter tied up," he said, "you all jump
to the conclusion that Mr Glass had tied him up; and then, I suppose,
escaped.  There are four objections to this: First, why should a gentleman
so dressy as our friend Glass leave his hat behind him, if he left
of his own free will? Second," he continued, moving towards the window,
"this is the only exit, and it is locked on the inside.  Third, this
blade here has a tiny touch of blood at the point, but there is
no wound on Mr Todhunter.  Mr Glass took that wound away with him,
dead or alive.  Add to all this primary probability.
It is much more likely that the blackmailed person would try to kill
his incubus, rather than that the blackmailer would try to kill
the goose that lays his golden egg.  There, I think, we have
a pretty complete story."

     "But the ropes?" inquired the priest, whose eyes had remained
open with a rather vacant admiration.

     "Ah, the ropes," said the expert with a singular intonation.
"Miss MacNab very much wanted to know why I did not set Mr Todhunter
free from his ropes.  Well, I will tell her.  I did not do it because
Mr Todhunter can set himself free from them at any minute he chooses."

     "What?" cried the audience on quite different notes of astonishment.

     "I have looked at all the knots on Mr Todhunter," reiterated Hood
quietly.  "I happen to know something about knots; they are quite
a branch of criminal science.  Every one of those knots he has
made himself and could loosen himself; not one of them would have been made
by an enemy really trying to pinion him.  The whole of this affair
of the ropes is a clever fake, to make us think him the victim of
the struggle instead of the wretched Glass, whose corpse may be hidden
in the garden or stuffed up the chimney."

     There was a rather depressed silence; the room was darkening,
the sea-blighted boughs of the garden trees looked leaner and
blacker than ever, yet they seemed to have come nearer to the window.
One could almost fancy they were sea-monsters like krakens or cuttlefish,
writhing polypi who had crawled up from the sea to see the end
of this tragedy, even as he, the villain and victim of it,
the terrible man in the tall hat, had once crawled up from the sea.
For the whole air was dense with the morbidity of blackmail, which is
the most morbid of human things, because it is a crime concealing a crime;
a black plaster on a blacker wound.

     The face of the little Catholic priest, which was commonly complacent
and even comic, had suddenly become knotted with a curious frown.
It was not the blank curiosity of his first innocence.  It was rather
that creative curiosity which comes when a man has the beginnings of
an idea.  "Say it again, please," he said in a simple, bothered manner;
"do you mean that Todhunter can tie himself up all alone and
untie himself all alone?"

     "That is what I mean," said the doctor.

     "Jerusalem!"  ejaculated Brown suddenly, "I wonder if it could
possibly be that!"

     He scuttled across the room rather like a rabbit, and peered with
quite a new impulsiveness into the partially-covered face of the captive.
Then he turned his own rather fatuous face to the company.
"Yes, that's it!" he cried in a certain excitement.  "Can't you see it
in the man's face?  Why, look at his eyes!"

     Both the Professor and the girl followed the direction of his glance.
And though the broad black scarf completely masked the lower half
of Todhunter's visage, they did grow conscious of something struggling
and intense about the upper part of it.

     "His eyes do look queer," cried the young woman, strongly moved.
"You brutes; I believe it's hurting him!"

     "Not that, I think," said Dr Hood; "the eyes have certainly
a singular expression.  But I should interpret those transverse
wrinkles as expressing rather such slight psychological abnormality--"

     "Oh, bosh!" cried Father Brown:  "can't you see he's laughing?"

     "Laughing!" repeated the doctor, with a start; "but what on earth
can he be laughing at?"

     "Well," replied the Reverend Brown apologetically,
"not to put too fine a point on it, I think he is laughing at you.
And indeed, I'm a little inclined to laugh at myself, now I know about it."

     "Now you know about what?" asked Hood, in some exasperation.

     "Now I know," replied the priest, "the profession of Mr Todhunter."

     He shuffled about the room, looking at one object after another
with what seemed to be a vacant stare, and then invariably bursting
into an equally vacant laugh, a highly irritating process for those
who had to watch it.  He laughed very much over the hat,
still more uproariously over the broken glass, but the blood on
the sword point sent him into mortal convulsions of amusement.
Then he turned to the fuming specialist.

     "Dr Hood," he cried enthusiastically, "you are a great poet!
You have called an uncreated being out of the void.  How much more godlike
that is than if you had only ferreted out the mere facts!
Indeed, the mere facts are rather commonplace and comic by comparison."

     "I have no notion what you are talking about," said Dr Hood
rather haughtily; "my facts are all inevitable, though necessarily incomplete.
A place may be permitted to intuition, perhaps (or poetry if you
prefer the term), but only because the corresponding details cannot
as yet be ascertained.  In the absence of Mr Glass--"

     "That's it, that's it," said the little priest, nodding quite eagerly,
"that's the first idea to get fixed; the absence of Mr Glass.
He is so extremely absent.  I suppose," he added reflectively,
"that there was never anybody so absent as Mr Glass."

     "Do you mean he is absent from the town?" demanded the doctor.

     "I mean he is absent from everywhere," answered Father Brown;
"he is absent from the Nature of Things, so to speak."

     "Do you seriously mean," said the specialist with a smile,
"that there is no such person?"

     The priest made a sign of assent.  "It does seem a pity," he said.

     Orion Hood broke into a contemptuous laugh.  "Well," he said,
"before we go on to the hundred and one other evidences, let us take
the first proof we found; the first fact we fell over when we fell
into this room.  If there is no Mr Glass, whose hat is this?"

     "It is Mr Todhunter's," replied Father Brown.

     "But it doesn't fit him," cried Hood impatiently.  "He couldn't
possibly wear it!"

     Father Brown shook his head with ineffable mildness.
"I never said he could wear it," he answered.  "I said it was his hat.
Or, if you insist on a shade of difference, a hat that is his."

     "And what is the shade of difference?" asked the criminologist
with a slight sneer.

     "My good sir," cried the mild little man, with his first movement
akin to impatience, "if you will walk down the street to the nearest
hatter's shop, you will see that there is, in common speech,
a difference between a man's hat and the hats that are his."

     "But a hatter," protested Hood, "can get money out of his
stock of new hats.  What could Todhunter get out of this one old hat?"

     "Rabbits," replied Father Brown promptly.

     "What?" cried Dr Hood.

     "Rabbits, ribbons, sweetmeats, goldfish, rolls of coloured paper,"
said the reverend gentleman with rapidity.  "Didn't you see it all
when you found out the faked ropes?  It's just the same with the sword.
Mr Todhunter hasn't got a scratch on him, as you say; but he's got
a scratch in him, if you follow me."

     "Do you mean inside Mr Todhunter's clothes?" inquired
Mrs MacNab sternly.

     "I do not mean inside Mr Todhunter's clothes," said Father Brown.
"I mean inside Mr Todhunter."

     "Well, what in the name of Bedlam do you mean?"

     "Mr Todhunter," explained Father Brown placidly, "is learning
to be a professional conjurer, as well as juggler, ventriloquist,
and expert in the rope trick.  The conjuring explains the hat.
It is without traces of hair, not because it is worn by
the prematurely bald Mr Glass, but because it has never been worn
by anybody.  The juggling explains the three glasses, which Todhunter
was teaching himself to throw up and catch in rotation.
But, being only at the stage of practice, he smashed one glass
against the ceiling.  And the juggling also explains the sword,
which it was Mr Todhunter's professional pride and duty to swallow.
But, again, being at the stage of practice, he very slightly grazed
the inside of his throat with the weapon.  Hence he has a wound
inside him, which I am sure (from the expression on his face)
is not a serious one.  He was also practising the trick of
a release from ropes, like the Davenport Brothers, and he was just about
to free himself when we all burst into the room.  The cards, of course,
are for card tricks, and they are scattered on the floor because
he had just been practising one of those dodges of sending them
flying through the air.  He merely kept his trade secret,
because he had to keep his tricks secret, like any other conjurer.
But the mere fact of an idler in a top hat having once looked in
at his back window, and been driven away by him with great indignation,
was enough to set us all on a wrong track of romance, and make us imagine
his whole life overshadowed by the silk-hatted spectre of Mr Glass."

     "But What about the two voices?" asked Maggie, staring.

     "Have you never heard a ventriloquist?" asked Father Brown.
"Don't you know they speak first in their natural voice, and then
answer themselves in just that shrill, squeaky, unnatural voice
that you heard?"

     There was a long silence, and Dr Hood regarded the little man
who had spoken with a dark and attentive smile.  "You are certainly
a very ingenious person," he said; "it could not have been done better
in a book.  But there is just one part of Mr Glass you have not succeeded
in explaining away, and that is his name.  Miss MacNab distinctly
heard him so addressed by Mr Todhunter."

     The Rev.  Mr Brown broke into a rather childish giggle.
"Well, that," he said, "that's the silliest part of the whole silly story.
When our juggling friend here threw up the three glasses in turn,
he counted them aloud as he caught them, and also commented aloud
when he failed to catch them.  What he really said was:  `One, two
and three--missed a glass one, two--missed a glass.'  And so on."

     There was a second of stillness in the room, and then everyone
with one accord burst out laughing.  As they did so the figure
in the corner complacently uncoiled all the ropes and let them fall
with a flourish.  Then, advancing into the middle of the room with a bow,
he produced from his pocket a big bill printed in blue and red,
which announced that ZALADIN, the World's Greatest Conjurer,
Contortionist, Ventriloquist and Human Kangaroo would be ready
with an entirely new series of Tricks at the Empire Pavilion,
Scarborough, on Monday next at eight o'clock precisely.



II. The Paradise of Thieves


THE great Muscari, most original of the young Tuscan poets,
walked swiftly into his favourite restaurant, which overlooked
the Mediterranean, was covered by an awning and fenced by little lemon
and orange trees.  Waiters in white aprons were already laying out
on white tables the insignia of an early and elegant lunch;
and this seemed to increase a satisfaction that already touched
the top of swagger.  Muscari had an eagle nose like Dante;
his hair and neckerchief were dark and flowing; he carried a black cloak,
and might almost have carried a black mask, so much did he bear with him
a sort of Venetian melodrama.  He acted as if a troubadour had still
a definite social office, like a bishop.  He went as near as
his century permitted to walking the world literally like Don Juan,
with rapier and guitar.

     For he never travelled without a case of swords, with which
he had fought many brilliant duels, or without a corresponding case
for his mandolin, with which he had actually serenaded Miss Ethel Harrogate,
the highly conventional daughter of a Yorkshire banker on a holiday.
Yet he was neither a charlatan nor a child; but a hot, logical Latin
who liked a certain thing and was it.  His poetry was as straightforward
as anyone else's prose.  He desired fame or wine or the beauty of women
with a torrid directness inconceivable among the cloudy ideals
or cloudy compromises of the north; to vaguer races his intensity
smelt of danger or even crime.  Like fire or the sea, he was too simple
to be trusted.

     The banker and his beautiful English daughter were staying
at the hotel attached to Muscari's restaurant; that was why it was
his favourite restaurant.  A glance flashed around the room
told him at once, however, that the English party had not descended.
The restaurant was glittering, but still comparatively empty.
Two priests were talking at a table in a corner, but Muscari
(an ardent Catholic) took no more notice of them than of a couple of crows.
But from a yet farther seat, partly concealed behind a dwarf tree
golden with oranges, there rose and advanced towards the poet a person
whose costume was the most aggressively opposite to his own.

     This figure was clad in tweeds of a piebald check, with a pink tie,
a sharp collar and protuberant yellow boots.  He contrived,
in the true tradition of 'Arry at Margate, to look at once startling
and commonplace.  But as the Cockney apparition drew nearer,
Muscari was astounded to observe that the head was distinctly
different from the body.  It was an Italian head: fuzzy, swarthy and
very vivacious, that rose abruptly out of the standing collar
like cardboard and the comic pink tie.  In fact it was a head he knew.
He recognized it, above all the dire erection of English holiday array,
as the face of an old but forgotten friend name Ezza.  This youth
had been a prodigy at college, and European fame was promised him
when he was barely fifteen; but when he appeared in the world he failed,
first publicly as a dramatist and a demagogue, and then privately
for years on end as an actor, a traveller, a commission agent
or a journalist.  Muscari had known him last behind the footlights;
he was but too well attuned to the excitements of that profession,
and it was believed that some moral calamity had swallowed him up.

     "Ezza!" cried the poet, rising and shaking hands in
a pleasant astonishment.  "Well, I've seen you in many costumes
in the green room; but I never expected to see you dressed up
as an Englishman."

     "This," answered Ezza gravely, "is not the costume of an Englishman,
but of the Italian of the future."

     "In that case," remarked Muscari, "I confess I prefer
the Italian of the past."

     "That is your old mistake, Muscari," said the man in tweeds,
shaking his head; "and the mistake of Italy.  In the sixteenth century
we Tuscans made the morning:  we had the newest steel, the newest carving,
the newest chemistry.  Why should we not now have the newest factories,
the newest motors, the newest finance--the newest clothes?"

     "Because they are not worth having," answered Muscari.
"You cannot make Italians really progressive; they are too intelligent.
Men who see the short cut to good living will never go by
the new elaborate roads."

     "Well, to me Marconi, or D'Annunzio, is the star of Italy"
said the other.  "That is why I have become a Futurist--and a courier."

     "A courier!" cried Muscari, laughing.  "Is that the last of your
list of trades?  And whom are you conducting?"

     "Oh, a man of the name of Harrogate, and his family, I believe."

     "Not the banker in this hotel?" inquired the poet,
with some eagerness.

     "That's the man," answered the courier.

     "Does it pay well?" asked the troubadour innocently.

     "It will pay me," said Ezza, with a very enigmatic smile.
"But I am a rather curious sort of courier."  Then, as if
changing the subject, he said abruptly:  "He has a daughter--and a son."

     "The daughter is divine," affirmed Muscari, "the father and son are,
I suppose, human.  But granted his harmless qualities doesn't that banker
strike you as a splendid instance of my argument?  Harrogate has millions
in his safes, and I have--the hole in my pocket.  But you daren't say--
you can't say--that he's cleverer than I, or bolder than I, or even
more energetic.  He's not clever, he's got eyes like blue buttons;
he's not energetic, he moves from chair to chair like a paralytic.
He's a conscientious, kindly old blockhead; but he's got money simply
because he collects money, as a boy collects stamps.
You're too strong-minded for business, Ezza.  You won't get on.
To be clever enough to get all that money, one must be stupid enough
to want it."

     "I'm stupid enough for that," said Ezza gloomily.  "But I should
suggest a suspension of your critique of the banker, for here he comes."

     Mr Harrogate, the great financier, did indeed enter the room,
but nobody looked at him.  He was a massive elderly man with
a boiled blue eye and faded grey-sandy moustaches; but for
his heavy stoop he might have been a colonel.  He carried several
unopened letters in his hand.  His son Frank was a really fine lad,
curly-haired, sun-burnt and strenuous; but nobody looked at him either.
All eyes, as usual, were riveted, for the moment at least,
upon Ethel Harrogate, whose golden Greek head and colour of the dawn
seemed set purposely above that sapphire sea, like a goddess's.
The poet Muscari drew a deep breath as if he were drinking something,
as indeed he was.  He was drinking the Classic; which his fathers made.
Ezza studied her with a gaze equally intense and far more baffling.

     Miss Harrogate was specially radiant and ready for conversation
on this occasion; and her family had fallen into the easier
Continental habit, allowing the stranger Muscari and even
the courier Ezza to share their table and their talk.  In Ethel Harrogate
conventionality crowned itself with a perfection and splendour of its own.
Proud of her father's prosperity, fond of fashionable pleasures,
a fond daughter but an arrant flirt, she was all these things with
a sort of golden good-nature that made her very pride pleasing
and her worldly respectability a fresh and hearty thing.

     They were in an eddy of excitement about some alleged peril
in the mountain path they were to attempt that week.  The danger was
not from rock and avalanche, but from something yet more romantic.
Ethel had been earnestly assured that brigands, the true cut-throats
of the modern legend, still haunted that ridge and held that pass
of the Apennines.

     "They say," she cried, with the awful relish of a schoolgirl,
"that all that country isn't ruled by the King of Italy, but by
the King of Thieves.  Who is the King of Thieves?"

     "A great man," replied Muscari, "worthy to rank with
your own Robin Hood, signorina.  Montano, the King of Thieves,
was first heard of in the mountains some ten years ago, when people
said brigands were extinct.  But his wild authority spread with
the swiftness of a silent revolution.  Men found his fierce proclamations
nailed in every mountain village; his sentinels, gun in hand,
in every mountain ravine.  Six times the Italian Government
tried to dislodge him, and was defeated in six pitched battles
as if by Napoleon."

     "Now that sort of thing," observed the banker weightily,
"would never be allowed in England; perhaps, after all, we had better
choose another route.  But the courier thought it perfectly safe."

     "It is perfectly safe," said the courier contemptuously.
"I have been over it twenty times.  There may have been some old
jailbird called a King in the time of our grandmothers;
but he belongs to history if not to fable.  Brigandage is utterly
stamped out."

     "It can never be utterly stamped out," Muscari answered;
"because armed revolt is a recreation natural to southerners.
Our peasants are like their mountains, rich in grace and green gaiety,
but with the fires beneath.  There is a point of human despair where
the northern poor take to drink--and our own poor take to daggers."

     "A poet is privileged," replied Ezza, with a sneer.
"If Signor Muscari were English be would still be looking
for highwaymen in Wandsworth.  Believe me, there is no more danger
of being captured in Italy than of being scalped in Boston."

     "Then you propose to attempt it?" asked Mr Harrogate, frowning.

     "Oh, it sounds rather dreadful," cried the girl, turning her
glorious eyes on Muscari.  "Do you really think the pass is dangerous?"

     Muscari threw back his black mane.  "I know it is dangerous:"
he said.  "I am crossing it tomorrow."

     The young Harrogate was left behind for a moment emptying a glass of
white wine and lighting a cigarette, as the beauty retired with the banker,
the courier and the poet, distributing peals of silvery satire.
At about the same instant the two priests in the corner rose;
the taller, a white-haired Italian, taking his leave.  The shorter priest
turned and walked towards the banker's son, and the latter was astonished
to realize that though a Roman priest the man was an Englishman.
He vaguely remembered meeting him at the social crushes of some of
his Catholic friends.  But the man spoke before his memories could
collect themselves.

     "Mr Frank Harrogate, I think," he said.  "I have had an introduction,
but I do not mean to presume on it.  The odd thing I have to say
will come far better from a stranger.  Mr Harrogate, I say one word and go:
take care of your sister in her great sorrow."

     Even for Frank's truly fraternal indifference the radiance
and derision of his sister still seemed to sparkle and ring;
he could hear her laughter still from the garden of the hotel,
and he stared at his sombre adviser in puzzledom.

     "Do you mean the brigands?" he asked; and then, remembering
a vague fear of his own, "or can you be thinking of Muscari?"

     "One is never thinking of the real sorrow," said the strange priest.
"One can only be kind when it comes."

     And he passed promptly from the room, leaving the other almost
with his mouth open.

     A day or two afterwards a coach containing the company was
really crawling and staggering up the spurs of the menacing mountain range.
Between Ezza's cheery denial of the danger and Muscari's boisterous
defiance of it, the financial family were firm in their original purpose;
and Muscari made his mountain journey coincide with theirs.
A more surprising feature was the appearance at the coast-town station
of the little priest of the restaurant; he alleged merely
that business led him also to cross the mountains of the midland.
But young Harrogate could not but connect his presence with
the mystical fears and warnings of yesterday.

     The coach was a kind of commodious wagonette, invented by
the modernist talent of the courier, who dominated the expedition
with his scientific activity and breezy wit.  The theory of danger from
thieves was banished from thought and speech; though so far conceded
in formal act that some slight protection was employed.  The courier
and the young banker carried loaded revolvers, and Muscari
(with much boyish gratification) buckled on a kind of cutlass
under his black cloak.

     He had planted his person at a flying leap next to
the lovely Englishwoman; on the other side of her sat the priest,
whose name was Brown and who was fortunately a silent individual;
the courier and the father and son were on the banc behind.
Muscari was in towering spirits, seriously believing in the peril,
and his talk to Ethel might well have made her think him a maniac.
But there was something in the crazy and gorgeous ascent,
amid crags like peaks loaded with woods like orchards, that dragged
her spirit up alone with his into purple preposterous heavens
with wheeling suns.  The white road climbed like a white cat;
it spanned sunless chasms like a tight-rope; it was flung round
far-off headlands like a lasso.

     And yet, however high they went, the desert still blossomed
like the rose.  The fields were burnished in sun and wind
with the colour of kingfisher and parrot and humming-bird,
the hues of a hundred flowering flowers.  There are no lovelier meadows
and woodlands than the English, no nobler crests or chasms than
those of Snowdon and Glencoe.  But Ethel Harrogate had never before
seen the southern parks tilted on the splintered northern peaks;
the gorge of Glencoe laden with the fruits of Kent.  There was nothing here
of that chill and desolation that in Britain one associates with
high and wild scenery.  It was rather like a mosaic palace,
rent with earthquakes; or like a Dutch tulip garden blown to the stars
with dynamite.

     "It's like Kew Gardens on Beachy Head," said Ethel.

     "It is our secret," answered he, "the secret of the volcano;
that is also the secret of the revolution--that a thing can be violent
and yet fruitful."

     "You are rather violent yourself," and she smiled at him.

     "And yet rather fruitless," he admitted; "if I die tonight
I die unmarried and a fool."

     "It is not my fault if you have come," she said after
a difficult silence.

     "It is never your fault," answered Muscari; "it was not your fault
that Troy fell."

     As they spoke they came under overwhelming cliffs that spread
almost like wings above a corner of peculiar peril.  Shocked by the
big shadow on the narrow ledge, the horses stirred doubtfully.
The driver leapt to the earth to hold their heads, and they
became ungovernable.  One horse reared up to his full height--
the titanic and terrifying height of a horse when he becomes a biped.
It was just enough to alter the equilibrium; the whole coach
heeled over like a ship and crashed through the fringe of bushes
over the cliff.  Muscari threw an arm round Ethel, who clung to him,
and shouted aloud.  It was for such moments that he lived.

     At the moment when the gorgeous mountain walls went round
the poet's head like a purple windmill a thing happened which was
superficially even more startling.  The elderly and lethargic banker
sprang erect in the coach and leapt over the precipice before
the tilted vehicle could take him there.  In the first flash
it looked as wild as suicide; but in the second it was as sensible as
a safe investment.  The Yorkshireman had evidently more promptitude,
as well as more sagacity, than Muscari had given him credit for;
for he landed in a lap of land which might have been specially padded
with turf and clover to receive him.  As it happened, indeed,
the whole company were equally lucky, if less dignified in their
form of ejection.  Immediately under this abrupt turn of the road
was a grassy and flowery hollow like a sunken meadow; a sort of
green velvet pocket in the long, green, trailing garments of the hills.
Into this they were all tipped or tumbled with little damage,
save that their smallest baggage and even the contents of their pockets
were scattered in the grass around them.  The wrecked coach still
hung above, entangled in the tough hedge, and the horses plunged
painfully down the slope.  The first to sit up was the little priest,
who scratched his head with a face of foolish wonder.  Frank Harrogate
heard him say to himself: "Now why on earth have we fallen just here?"

     He blinked at the litter around him, and recovered his own
very clumsy umbrella.  Beyond it lay the broad sombrero fallen from
the head of Muscari, and beside it a sealed business letter which,
after a glance at the address, he returned to the elder Harrogate.
On the other side of him the grass partly hid Miss Ethel's sunshade,
and just beyond it lay a curious little glass bottle hardly two inches long.
The priest picked it up; in a quick, unobtrusive manner he uncorked
and sniffed it, and his heavy face turned the colour of clay.

     "Heaven deliver us!" he muttered; "it can't be hers!
Has her sorrow come on her already?" He slipped it into his own
waistcoat pocket.  "I think I'm justified," he said, "till I know
a little more."

     He gazed painfully at the girl, at that moment being raised out of
the flowers by Muscari, who was saying:  "We have fallen into heaven;
it is a sign.  Mortals climb up and they fall down; but it is only
gods and goddesses who can fall upwards."

     And indeed she rose out of the sea of colours so beautiful and
happy a vision that the priest felt his suspicion shaken and shifted.
"After all," he thought, "perhaps the poison isn't hers; perhaps it's
one of Muscari's melodramatic tricks."

     Muscari set the lady lightly on her feet, made her an absurdly
theatrical bow, and then, drawing his cutlass, hacked hard at
the taut reins of the horses, so that they scrambled to their feet
and stood in the grass trembling.  When he had done so,
a most remarkable thing occurred.  A very quiet man, very poorly dressed
and extremely sunburnt, came out of the bushes and took hold of
the horses' heads.  He had a queer-shaped knife, very broad and crooked,
buckled on his belt; there was nothing else remarkable about him,
except his sudden and silent appearance.  The poet asked him who he was,
and he did not answer.

     Looking around him at the confused and startled group in the hollow,
Muscari then perceived that another tanned and tattered man,
with a short gun under his arm, was looking at them from
the ledge just below, leaning his elbows on the edge of the turf.
Then he looked up at the road from which they had fallen and saw,
looking down on them, the muzzles of four other carbines and
four other brown faces with bright but quite motionless eyes.

     "The brigands!" cried Muscari, with a kind of monstrous gaiety.
"This was a trap.  Ezza, if you will oblige me by shooting the
coachman first, we can cut our way out yet.  There are only six of them."

     "The coachman," said Ezza, who was standing grimly with his hands
in his pockets, "happens to be a servant of Mr Harrogate's."

     "Then shoot him all the more," cried the poet impatiently;
"he was bribed to upset his master.  Then put the lady in the middle,
and we will break the line up there--with a rush."

     And, wading in wild grass and flowers, he advanced fearlessly
on the four carbines; but finding that no one followed except
young Harrogate, he turned, brandishing his cutlass to wave the others on.
He beheld the courier still standing slightly astride in the centre of
the grassy ring, his hands in his pockets; and his lean, ironical
Italian face seemed to grow longer and longer in the evening light.

     "You thought, Muscari, I was the failure among our schoolfellows,"
he said, "and you thought you were the success.  But I have succeeded
more than you and fill a bigger place in history.  I have been
acting epics while you have been writing them."

     "Come on, I tell you!" thundered Muscari from above.
"Will you stand there talking nonsense about yourself with a woman
to save and three strong men to help you?  What do you call yourself?"

     "I call myself Montano," cried the strange courier in a voice
equally loud and full.  "I am the King of Thieves, and I welcome you all
to my summer palace."

     And even as he spoke five more silent men with weapons ready
came out of the bushes, and looked towards him for their orders.
One of them held a large paper in his hand.

     "This pretty little nest where we are all picnicking,"
went on the courier-brigand, with the same easy yet sinister smile,
"is, together with some caves underneath it, known by the name of
the Paradise of Thieves.  It is my principal stronghold on these hills;
for (as you have doubtless noticed) the eyrie is invisible both from
the road above and from the valley below.  It is something better
than impregnable; it is unnoticeable.  Here I mostly live, and here
I shall certainly die, if the gendarmes ever track me here.
I am not the kind of criminal that `reserves his defence,'
but the better kind that reserves his last bullet."

     All were staring at him thunderstruck and still, except Father Brown,
who heaved a huge sigh as of relief and fingered the little phial
in his pocket.  "Thank God!" he muttered; "that's much more probable.
The poison belongs to this robber-chief, of course.  He carries it
so that he may never be captured, like Cato."

     The King of Thieves was, however, continuing his address with
the same kind of dangerous politeness.  "It only remains for me,"
he said, "to explain to my guests the social conditions upon which
I have the pleasure of entertaining them.  I need not expound
the quaint old ritual of ransom, which it is incumbent upon me
to keep up; and even this only applies to a part of the company.
The Reverend Father Brown and the celebrated Signor Muscari
I shall release tomorrow at dawn and escort to my outposts.
Poets and priests, if you will pardon my simplicity of speech,
never have any money.  And so (since it is impossible to get anything
out of them), let us, seize the opportunity to show our admiration for
classic literature and our reverence for Holy Church."

     He paused with an unpleasing smile; and Father Brown
blinked repeatedly at him, and seemed suddenly to be listening
with great attention.  The brigand captain took the large paper from
the attendant brigand and, glancing over it, continued:
"My other intentions are clearly set forth in this public document,
which I will hand round in a moment; and which after that will be
posted on a tree by every village in the valley, and every cross-road
in the hills.  I will not weary you with the verbalism, since you
will be able to check it; the substance of my proclamation is this:
I announce first that I have captured the English millionaire,
the colossus of finance, Mr Samuel Harrogate.  I next announce
that I have found on his person notes and bonds for two thousand pounds,
which he has given up to me.  Now since it would be really immoral
to announce such a thing to a credulous public if it had not occurred,
I suggest it should occur without further delay.  I suggest that
Mr Harrogate senior should now give me the two thousand pounds
in his pocket."

     The banker looked at him under lowering brows, red-faced and sulky,
but seemingly cowed.  That leap from the failing carriage seemed
to have used up his last virility.  He had held back in a hang-dog style
when his son and Muscari had made a bold movement to break out of
the brigand trap.  And now his red and trembling hand went reluctantly
to his breast-pocket, and passed a bundle of papers and envelopes
to the brigand.

     "Excellent!" cried that outlaw gaily; "so far we are all cosy.
I resume the points of my proclamation, so soon to be published
to all Italy.  The third item is that of ransom.  I am asking
from the friends of the Harrogate family a ransom of three thousand pounds,
which I am sure is almost insulting to that family in its moderate estimate
of their importance.  Who would not pay triple this sum for another day's
association with such a domestic circle?  I will not conceal from you
that the document ends with certain legal phrases about
the unpleasant things that may happen if the money is not paid;
but meanwhile, ladies and gentlemen, let me assure you that
I am comfortably off here for accommodation, wine and cigars,
and bid you for the present a sportsman-like welcome to the luxuries
of the Paradise of Thieves."

     All the time that he had been speaking, the dubious-looking men
with carbines and dirty slouch hats had been gathering silently
in such preponderating numbers that even Muscari was compelled
to recognize his sally with the sword as hopeless.  He glanced around him;
but the girl had already gone over to soothe and comfort her father,
for her natural affection for his person was as strong or stronger than
her somewhat snobbish pride in his success.  Muscari, with the illogicality
of a lover, admired this filial devotion, and yet was irritated by it.
He slapped his sword back in the scabbard and went and flung himself
somewhat sulkily on one of the green banks.  The priest sat down
within a yard or two, and Muscari turned his aquiline nose on him
in an instantaneous irritation.

     "Well," said the poet tartly, "do people still think me too romantic?
Are there, I wonder, any brigands left in the mountains?"

     "There may be," said Father Brown agnostically.

     "What do you mean?" asked the other sharply.

     "I mean I am puzzled," replied the priest.  "I am puzzled about
Ezza or Montano, or whatever his name is.  He seems to me much more
inexplicable as a brigand even than he was as a courier."

     "But in what way?" persisted his companion.  "Santa Maria!
I should have thought the brigand was plain enough."

     "I find three curious difficulties," said the priest in a quiet voice.
"I should like to have your opinion on them.  First of all
I must tell you I was lunching in that restaurant at the seaside.
As four of you left the room, you and Miss Harrogate went ahead,
talking and laughing; the banker and the courier came behind,
speaking sparely and rather low.  But I could not help hearing Ezza
say these words--`Well, let her have a little fun; you know the blow
may smash her any minute.'  Mr Harrogate answered nothing;
so the words must have had some meaning.  On the impulse of the moment
I warned her brother that she might be in peril; I said nothing
of its nature, for I did not know.  But if it meant this capture
in the hills, the thing is nonsense.  Why should the brigand-courier
warn his patron, even by a hint, when it was his whole purpose to lure him
into the mountain-mousetrap?  It could not have meant that.
But if not, what is this disaster, known both to courier and banker,
which hangs over Miss Harrogate's head?"

     "Disaster to Miss Harrogate!" ejaculated the poet, sitting up
with some ferocity.  "Explain yourself; go on."

     "All my riddles, however, revolve round our bandit chief,"
resumed the priest reflectively.  "And here is the second of them.
Why did he put so prominently in his demand for ransom the fact that
he had taken two thousand pounds from his victim on the spot?
It had no faintest tendency to evoke the ransom.  Quite the other way,
in fact.  Harrogate's friends would be far likelier to fear for his fate
if they thought the thieves were poor and desperate.  Yet the spoliation
on the spot was emphasized and even put first in the demand.
Why should Ezza Montano want so specially to tell all Europe that
he had picked the pocket before he levied the blackmail?"

     "I cannot imagine," said Muscari, rubbing up his black hair
for once with an unaffected gesture.  "You may think you enlighten me,
but you are leading me deeper in the dark.  What may be the third
objection to the King of the Thieves?"  "The third objection,"
said Father Brown, still in meditation, "is this bank we are sitting on.
Why does our brigand-courier call this his chief fortress and
the Paradise of Thieves?  It is certainly a soft spot to fall on
and a sweet spot to look at.  It is also quite true, as he says,
that it is invisible from valley and peak, and is therefore a hiding-place.
But it is not a fortress.  It never could be a fortress.
I think it would be the worst fortress in the world.  For it is actually
commanded from above by the common high-road across the mountains--
the very place where the police would most probably pass.
Why, five shabby short guns held us helpless here about half an hour ago.
The quarter of a company of any kind of soldiers could have blown us
over the precipice.  Whatever is the meaning of this odd little nook
of grass and flowers, it is not an entrenched position.
It is something else; it has some other strange sort of importance;
some value that I do not understand.  It is more like an accidental theatre
or a natural green-room; it is like the scene for some romantic comedy;
it is like...."

     As the little priest's words lengthened and lost themselves
in a dull and dreamy sincerity, Muscari, whose animal senses were alert
and impatient, heard a new noise in the mountains.  Even for him
the sound was as yet very small and faint; but he could have sworn
the evening breeze bore with it something like the pulsation of
horses' hoofs and a distant hallooing.

     At the same moment, and long before the vibration had touched
the less-experienced English ears, Montano the brigand ran up
the bank above them and stood in the broken hedge, steadying himself
against a tree and peering down the road.  He was a strange figure
as he stood there, for he had assumed a flapped fantastic hat and
swinging baldric and cutlass in his capacity of bandit king,
but the bright prosaic tweed of the courier showed through in patches
all over him.

     The next moment he turned his olive, sneering face and made
a movement with his hand.  The brigands scattered at the signal,
not in confusion, but in what was evidently a kind of guerrilla discipline.
Instead of occupying the road along the ridge, they sprinkled themselves
along the side of it behind the trees and the hedge, as if watching unseen
for an enemy.  The noise beyond grew stronger, beginning to shake
the mountain road, and a voice could be clearly heard calling out orders.
The brigands swayed and huddled, cursing and whispering,
and the evening air was full of little metallic noises as they
cocked their pistols, or loosened their knives, or trailed their scabbards
over the stones.  Then the noises from both quarters seemed to meet
on the road above; branches broke, horses neighed, men cried out.

     "A rescue!" cried Muscari, springing to his feet and waving his hat;
"the gendarmes are on them!  Now for freedom and a blow for it!
Now to be rebels against robbers!  Come, don't let us leave everything
to the police; that is so dreadfully modern.  Fall on the rear
of these ruffians.  The gendarmes are rescuing us; come, friends,
let us rescue the gendarmes!"

     And throwing his hat over the trees, he drew his cutlass once more
and began to escalade the slope up to the road.  Frank Harrogate
jumped up and ran across to help him, revolver in hand, but was astounded
to hear himself imperatively recalled by the raucous voice of his father,
who seemed to be in great agitation.

     "I won't have it," said the banker in a choking voice;
"I command you not to interfere."

     "But, father," said Frank very warmly, "an Italian gentleman has
led the way.  You wouldn't have it said that the English hung back."

     "It is useless," said the older man, who was trembling violently,
"it is useless.  We must submit to our lot."

     Father Brown looked at the banker; then he put his hand instinctively
as if on his heart, but really on the little bottle of poison;
and a great light came into his face like the light of the revelation
of death.

     Muscari meanwhile, without waiting for support, had crested the bank
up to the road, and struck the brigand king heavily on the shoulder,
causing him to stagger and swing round.  Montano also had
his cutlass unsheathed, and Muscari, without further speech,
sent a slash at his head which he was compelled to catch and parry.
But even as the two short blades crossed and clashed the King of Thieves
deliberately dropped his point and laughed.

     "What's the good, old man?" he said in spirited Italian slang;
"this damned farce will soon be over."

     "What do you mean, you shuffler?" panted the fire-eating poet.
"Is your courage a sham as well as your honesty?"

     "Everything about me is a sham," responded the ex-courier
in complete good humour.  "I am an actor; and if I ever had
a private character, I have forgotten it.  I am no more a genuine brigand
than I am a genuine courier.  I am only a bundle of masks,
and you can't fight a duel with that."  And he laughed with boyish pleasure
and fell into his old straddling attitude, with his back to the skirmish
up the road.

     Darkness was deepening under the mountain walls, and it was not easy
to discern much of the progress of the struggle, save that tall men
were pushing their horses' muzzles through a clinging crowd of brigands,
who seemed more inclined to harass and hustle the invaders
than to kill them.  It was more like a town crowd preventing
the passage of the police than anything the poet had ever pictured
as the last stand of doomed and outlawed men of blood.  Just as he was
rolling his eyes in bewilderment he felt a touch on his elbow,
and found the odd little priest standing there like a small Noah
with a large hat, and requesting the favour of a word or two.

     "Signor Muscari," said the cleric, "in this queer crisis
personalities may be pardoned.  I may tell you without offence
of a way in which you will do more good than by helping the gendarmes,
who are bound to break through in any case.  You will permit me
the impertinent intimacy, but do you care about that girl?
Care enough to marry her and make her a good husband, I mean?"

     "Yes," said the poet quite simply.

     "Does she care about you?"

     "I think so," was the equally grave reply.

     "Then go over there and offer yourself," said the priest:
"offer her everything you can; offer her heaven and earth
if you've got them.  The time is short."

     "Why?" asked the astonished man of letters.

     "Because," said Father Brown, "her Doom is coming up the road."

     "Nothing is coming up the road," argued Muscari, "except the rescue."

     "Well, you go over there," said his adviser, "and be ready
to rescue her from the rescue."

     Almost as he spoke the hedges were broken all along the ridge
by a rush of the escaping brigands.  They dived into bushes
and thick grass like defeated men pursued; and the great cocked hats
of the mounted gendarmerie were seen passing along above the broken hedge.
Another order was given; there was a noise of dismounting,
and a tall officer with cocked hat, a grey imperial, and a paper in his hand
appeared in the gap that was the gate of the Paradise of Thieves.
There was a momentary silence, broken in an extraordinary way by the banker,
who cried out in a hoarse and strangled voice: "Robbed!  I've been robbed!"

     "Why, that was hours ago," cried his son in astonishment:
"when you were robbed of two thousand pounds."

     "Not of two thousand pounds," said the financier, with an abrupt
and terrible composure, "only of a small bottle."

     The policeman with the grey imperial was striding across
the green hollow.  Encountering the King of the Thieves in his path,
he clapped him on the shoulder with something between a caress
and a buffet and gave him a push that sent him staggering away.
"You'll get into trouble, too," he said, "if you play these tricks."

     Again to Muscari's artistic eye it seemed scarcely like
the capture of a great outlaw at bay.  Passing on, the policeman halted
before the Harrogate group and said:  "Samuel Harrogate, I arrest you
in the name of the law for embezzlement of the funds of the Hull and
Huddersfield Bank."

     The great banker nodded with an odd air of business assent,
seemed to reflect a moment, and before they could interpose took
a half turn and a step that brought him to the edge of the outer
mountain wall.  Then, flinging up his hands, he leapt exactly as he leapt
out of the coach.  But this time he did not fall into a little meadow
just beneath; he fell a thousand feet below, to become a wreck of bones
in the valley.

     The anger of the Italian policeman, which he expressed volubly
to Father Brown, was largely mixed with admiration.  "It was like him
to escape us at last," he said.  "He was a great brigand if you like.
This last trick of his I believe to be absolutely unprecedented.
He fled with the company's money to Italy, and actually got himself
captured by sham brigands in his own pay, so as to explain both the
disappearance of the money and the disappearance of himself.
That demand for ransom was really taken seriously by most of the police.
But for years he's been doing things as good as that, quite as good
as that.  He will be a serious loss to his family."

     Muscari was leading away the unhappy daughter, who held hard to him,
as she did for many a year after.  But even in that tragic wreck
he could not help having a smile and a hand of half-mocking friendship
for the indefensible Ezza Montano.  "And where are you going next?"
he asked him over his shoulder.

     "Birmingham," answered the actor, puffing a cigarette.
"Didn't I tell you I was a Futurist?  I really do believe in those things
if I believe in anything.  Change, bustle and new things every morning.
I am going to Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds, Hull, Huddersfield,
Glasgow, Chicago--in short, to enlightened, energetic, civilized society!"

     "In short," said Muscari, "to the real Paradise of Thieves."



III. The Duel of Dr Hirsch


M. MAURICE BRUN and M. Armand Armagnac were crossing the sunlit
Champs Elysee with a kind of vivacious respectability.
They were both short, brisk and bold.  They both had black beards
that did not seem to belong to their faces, after the strange French fashion
which makes real hair look like artificial.  M. Brun had
a dark wedge of beard apparently affixed under his lower lip.
M. Armagnac, by way of a change, had two beards; one sticking out
from each corner of his emphatic chin.  They were both young.
They were both atheists, with a depressing fixity of outlook
but great mobility of exposition.  They were both pupils of
the great Dr Hirsch, scientist, publicist and moralist.

     M. Brun had become prominent by his proposal that the common
expression "Adieu" should be obliterated from all the French classics,
and a slight fine imposed for its use in private life.  "Then," he said,
"the very name of your imagined God will have echoed for the last time
in the ear of man."  M. Armagnac specialized rather in a resistance
to militarism, and wished the chorus of the Marseillaise altered from
"Aux armes, citoyens" to "Aux greves, citoyens".  But his antimilitarism
was of a peculiar and Gallic sort.  An eminent and very wealthy
English Quaker, who had come to see him to arrange for the disarmament
of the whole planet, was rather distressed by Armagnac's proposal
that (by way of beginning) the soldiers should shoot their officers.

     And indeed it was in this regard that the two men differed most
from their leader and father in philosophy.  Dr Hirsch,
though born in France and covered with the most triumphant favours
of French education, was temperamentally of another type--mild, dreamy,
humane; and, despite his sceptical system, not devoid of transcendentalism.
He was, in short, more like a German than a Frenchman; and much as they
admired him, something in the subconsciousness of these Gauls was
irritated at his pleading for peace in so peaceful a manner.
To their party throughout Europe, however, Paul Hirsch was
a saint of science.  His large and daring cosmic theories
advertised his austere life and innocent, if somewhat frigid, morality;
he held something of the position of Darwin doubled with the position
of Tolstoy.  But he was neither an anarchist nor an antipatriot;
his views on disarmament were moderate and evolutionary--
the Republican Government put considerable confidence in him
as to various chemical improvements.  He had lately even discovered
a noiseless explosive, the secret of which the Government was
carefully guarding.

     His house stood in a handsome street near the Elysee--
a street which in that strong summer seemed almost as full of foliage
as the park itself; a row of chestnuts shattered the sunshine,
interrupted only in one place where a large cafe ran out into the street.
Almost opposite to this were the white and green blinds of
the great scientist's house, an iron balcony, also painted green,
running along in front of the first-floor windows.  Beneath this was
the entrance into a kind of court, gay with shrubs and tiles,
into which the two Frenchmen passed in animated talk.

     The door was opened to them by the doctor's old servant, Simon,
who might very well have passed for a doctor himself, having a strict
suit of black, spectacles, grey hair, and a confidential manner.
In fact, he was a far more presentable man of science than his master,
Dr Hirsch, who was a forked radish of a fellow, with just enough
bulb of a head to make his body insignificant.  With all the gravity
of a great physician handling a prescription, Simon handed a letter
to M. Armagnac.  That gentleman ripped it up with a racial impatience,
and rapidly read the following:

     I cannot come down to speak to you.  There is a man in this house
whom I refuse to meet.  He is a Chauvinist officer, Dubosc.
He is sitting on the stairs.  He has been kicking the furniture about
in all the other rooms; I have locked myself in my study,
opposite that cafe.  If you love me, go over to the cafe and wait
at one of the tables outside.  I will try to send him over to you.
I want you to answer him and deal with him.  I cannot meet him myself.
I cannot: I will not.

     There is going to be another Dreyfus case.

                                             P. HIRSCH



     M. Armagnac looked at M. Brun.  M. Brun borrowed the letter,
read it, and looked at M. Armagnac.  Then both betook themselves briskly
to one of the little tables under the chestnuts opposite,
where they procured two tall glasses of horrible green absinthe,
which they could drink apparently in any weather and at any time.
Otherwise the cafe seemed empty, except for one soldier drinking coffee
at one table, and at another a large man drinking a small syrup and
a priest drinking nothing.

     Maurice Brun cleared his throat and said:  "Of course we must help
the master in every way, but--"

     There was an abrupt silence, and Armagnac said:  "He may have
excellent reasons for not meeting the man himself, but--"

     Before either could complete a sentence, it was evident that
the invader had been expelled from the house opposite.  The shrubs under
the archway swayed and burst apart, as that unwelcome guest was
shot out of them like a cannon-ball.

     He was a sturdy figure in a small and tilted Tyrolean felt hat,
a figure that had indeed something generally Tyrolean about it.
The man's shoulders were big and broad, but his legs were neat and active
in knee-breeches and knitted stockings.  His face was brown like a nut;
he had very bright and restless brown eyes; his dark hair was brushed back
stiffly in front and cropped close behind, outlining a square and
powerful skull; and he had a huge black moustache like the horns of a bison.
Such a substantial head is generally based on a bull neck; but this was
hidden by a big coloured scarf, swathed round up the man's ears
and falling in front inside his jacket like a sort of fancy waistcoat.
It was a scarf of strong dead colours, dark red and old gold and purple,
probably of Oriental fabrication.  Altogether the man had something
a shade barbaric about him; more like a Hungarian squire than
an ordinary French officer.  His French, however, was obviously
that of a native; and his French patriotism was so impulsive
as to be slightly absurd.  His first act when he burst out of the archway
was to call in a clarion voice down the street:  "Are there any
Frenchmen here?" as if he were calling for Christians in Mecca.

     Armagnac and Brun instantly stood up; but they were too late.
Men were already running from the street corners; there was a small
but ever-clustering crowd.  With the prompt French instinct for
the politics of the street, the man with the black moustache had already
run across to a corner of the cafe, sprung on one of the tables,
and seizing a branch of chestnut to steady himself, shouted
as Camille Desmoulins once shouted when he scattered the oak-leaves
among the populace.

     "Frenchmen!" he volleyed; "I cannot speak!  God help me, that is why
I am speaking!  The fellows in their filthy parliaments who learn
to speak also learn to be silent--silent as that spy cowering
in the house opposite!  Silent as he is when I beat on his bedroom door!
Silent as he is now, though he hears my voice across this street
and shakes where he sits!  Oh, they can be silent eloquently--
the politicians!  But the time has come when we that cannot speak
must speak.  You are betrayed to the Prussians.  Betrayed at this moment.
Betrayed by that man.  I am Jules Dubosc, Colonel of Artillery, Belfort.
We caught a German spy in the Vosges yesterday, and a paper was found
on him--a paper I hold in my hand.  Oh, they tried to hush it up;
but I took it direct to the man who wrote it--the man in that house!
It is in his hand.  It is signed with his initials.  It is a direction
for finding the secret of this new Noiseless Powder.  Hirsch invented it;
Hirsch wrote this note about it.  This note is in German, and was found
in a German's pocket.  `Tell the man the formula for powder is in
grey envelope in first drawer to the left of Secretary's desk,
War Office, in red ink.  He must be careful.  P.H.'"

     He rattled short sentences like a quick-firing gun, but he was plainly
the sort of man who is either mad or right.  The mass of the crowd
was Nationalist, and already in threatening uproar; and a minority
of equally angry Intellectuals, led by Armagnac and Brun, only made
the majority more militant.

     "If this is a military secret," shouted Brun, "why do you yell
about it in the street?"

     "I will tell you why I do!" roared Dubosc above the roaring crowd.
"I went to this man in straight and civil style.  If he had any explanation
it could have been given in complete confidence.  He refuses to explain.
He refers me to two strangers in a cafe as to two flunkeys.
He has thrown me out of the house, but I am going back into it,
with the people of Paris behind me!"

     A shout seemed to shake the very facade of mansions and
two stones flew, one breaking a window above the balcony.
The indignant Colonel plunged once more under the archway and was heard
crying and thundering inside.  Every instant the human sea grew wider
and wider; it surged up against the rails and steps of the traitor's house;
it was already certain that the place would be burst into like
the Bastille, when the broken french window opened and Dr Hirsch came out
on the balcony.  For an instant the fury half turned to laughter;
for he was an absurd figure in such a scene.  His long bare neck and
sloping shoulders were the shape of a champagne bottle, but that was
the only festive thing about him.  His coat hung on him as on a peg;
he wore his carrot-coloured hair long and weedy; his cheeks and chin
were fully fringed with one of those irritating beards that begin
far from the mouth.  He was very pale, and he wore blue spectacles.

     Livid as he was, he spoke with a sort of prim decision,
so that the mob fell silent in the middle of his third sentence.

     "...only two things to say to you now.  The first is to my foes,
the second to my friends.  To my foes I say:  It is true I will not
meet M. Dubosc, though he is storming outside this very room.
It is true I have asked two other men to confront him for me.
And I will tell you why!  Because I will not and must not see him--
because it would be against all rules of dignity and honour to see him.
Before I am triumphantly cleared before a court, there is
another arbitration this gentleman owes me as a gentleman,
and in referring him to my seconds I am strictly--"

     Armagnac and Brun were waving their hats wildly, and even
the Doctor's enemies roared applause at this unexpected defiance.
Once more a few sentences were inaudible, but they could hear him say:
"To my friends--I myself should always prefer weapons purely intellectual,
and to these an evolved humanity will certainly confine itself.
But our own most precious truth is the fundamental force of matter
and heredity.  My books are successful; my theories are unrefuted;
but I suffer in politics from a prejudice almost physical in the French.
I cannot speak like Clemenceau and Deroulede, for their words are like
echoes of their pistols.  The French ask for a duellist as the English
ask for a sportsman.  Well, I give my proofs:  I will pay
this barbaric bribe, and then go back to reason for the rest of my life."

     Two men were instantly found in the crowd itself to offer
their services to Colonel Dubosc, who came out presently, satisfied.
One was the common soldier with the coffee, who said simply:
"I will act for you, sir.  I am the Duc de Valognes."  The other was
the big man, whom his friend the priest sought at first to dissuade;
and then walked away alone.

     In the early evening a light dinner was spread at the back of
the Cafe Charlemagne.  Though unroofed by any glass or gilt plaster,
the guests were nearly all under a delicate and irregular roof of leaves;
for the ornamental trees stood so thick around and among the tables
as to give something of the dimness and the dazzle of a small orchard.
At one of the central tables a very stumpy little priest sat
in complete solitude, and applied himself to a pile of whitebait
with the gravest sort of enjoyment.  His daily living being very plain,
he had a peculiar taste for sudden and isolated luxuries; he was
an abstemious epicure.  He did not lift his eyes from his plate,
round which red pepper, lemons, brown bread and butter, etc.,
were rigidly ranked, until a tall shadow fell across the table,
and his friend Flambeau sat down opposite.  Flambeau was gloomy.

     "I'm afraid I must chuck this business," said he heavily.
"I'm all on the side of the French soldiers like Dubosc,
and I'm all against the French atheists like Hirsch; but it seems to me
in this case we've made a mistake.  The Duke and I thought it as well
to investigate the charge, and I must say I'm glad we did."

     "Is the paper a forgery, then?" asked the priest

     "That's just the odd thing," replied Flambeau.  "It's exactly like
Hirsch's writing, and nobody can point out any mistake in it.
But it wasn't written by Hirsch.  If he's a French patriot
he didn't write it, because it gives information to Germany.
And if he's a German spy he didn't write it, well--because it doesn't
give information to Germany."

     "You mean the information is wrong?" asked Father Brown.

     "Wrong," replied the other, "and wrong exactly where Dr Hirsch
would have been right--about the hiding-place of his own secret formula
in his own official department.  By favour of Hirsch and the authorities,
the Duke and I have actually been allowed to inspect the secret drawer
at the War Office where the Hirsch formula is kept.  We are the only people
who have ever known it, except the inventor himself and the Minister
for War; but the Minister permitted it to save Hirsch from fighting.
After that we really can't support Dubosc if his revelation
is a mare's nest."

     "And it is?" asked Father Brown.

     "It is," said his friend gloomily.  "It is a clumsy forgery
by somebody who knew nothing of the real hiding-place.  It says the paper
is in the cupboard on the right of the Secretary's desk.  As a fact
the cupboard with the secret drawer is some way to the left of the desk.
It says the grey envelope contains a long document written in red ink.
It isn't written in red ink, but in ordinary black ink.
It's manifestly absurd to say that Hirsch can have made a mistake
about a paper that nobody knew of but himself; or can have tried
to help a foreign thief by telling him to fumble in the wrong drawer.
I think we must chuck it up and apologize to old Carrots."

     Father Brown seemed to cogitate; he lifted a little whitebait
on his fork.  "You are sure the grey envelope was in the left cupboard?"
he asked.

     "Positive," replied Flambeau.  "The grey envelope--
it was a white envelope really--was--"

     Father Brown put down the small silver fish and the fork and
stared across at his companion.  "What?" he asked, in an altered voice.

     "Well, what?" repeated Flambeau, eating heartily.

     "It was not grey," said the priest.  "Flambeau, you frighten me."

     "What the deuce are you frightened of?"

     "I'm frightened of a white envelope," said the other seriously,
"If it had only just been grey!  Hang it all, it might as well
have been grey.  But if it was white, the whole business is black.
The Doctor has been dabbling in some of the old brimstone after all."

     "But I tell you he couldn't have written such a note!"
cried Flambeau.  "The note is utterly wrong about the facts.
And innocent or guilty, Dr Hirsch knew all about the facts."

     "The man who wrote that note knew all about the facts,"
said his clerical companion soberly.  "He could never have
got 'em so wrong without knowing about 'em.  You have to know
an awful lot to be wrong on every subject--like the devil."

     "Do you mean--?"

     "I mean a man telling lies on chance would have told some of the truth,"
said his friend firmly.  "Suppose someone sent you to find a house
with a green door and a blue blind, with a front garden but no back garden,
with a dog but no cat, and where they drank coffee but not tea.
You would say if you found no such house that it was all made up.
But I say no.  I say if you found a house where the door was blue and
the blind green, where there was a back garden and no front garden,
where cats were common and dogs instantly shot, where tea was drunk
in quarts and coffee forbidden--then you would know you had
found the house.  The man must have known that particular house
to be so accurately inaccurate."

     "But what could it mean?" demanded the diner opposite.

     "I can't conceive," said Brown; "I don't understand this Hirsch
affair at all.  As long as it was only the left drawer instead of
the right, and red ink instead of black, I thought it must be the
chance blunders of a forger, as you say.  But three is a mystical number;
it finishes things.  It finishes this.  That the direction about
the drawer, the colour of ink, the colour of envelope, should none of
them be right by accident, that can't be a coincidence.  It wasn't."

     "What was it, then?  Treason?" asked Flambeau, resuming his dinner.

     "I don't know that either," answered Brown, with a face
of blank bewilderment.  "The only thing I can think of....
Well, I never understood that Dreyfus case.  I can always grasp
moral evidence easier than the other sorts.  I go by a man's eyes and voice,
don't you know, and whether his family seems happy, and by what
subjects he chooses--and avoids.  Well, I was puzzled in the Dreyfus case.
Not by the horrible things imputed both ways; I know (though it's not
modern to say so) that human nature in the highest places is still capable
of being Cenci or Borgia.  No--, what puzzled me was the sincerity
of both parties.  I don't mean the political parties; the rank and file
are always roughly honest, and often duped.  I mean the persons
of the play.  I mean the conspirators, if they were conspirators.
I mean the traitor, if he was a traitor.  I mean the men who must have
known the truth.  Now Dreyfus went on like a man who knew he was
a wronged man.  And yet the French statesmen and soldiers went on
as if they knew he wasn't a wronged man but simply a wrong 'un.
I don't mean they behaved well; I mean they behaved as if they were sure.
I can't describe these things; I know what I mean."

     "I wish I did," said his friend.  "And what has it to do
with old Hirsch?"

     "Suppose a person in a position of trust," went on the priest,
"began to give the enemy information because it was false information.
Suppose he even thought he was saving his country by misleading the foreigner.
Suppose this brought him into spy circles, and little loans were made to him,
and little ties tied on to him.  Suppose he kept up his contradictory
position in a confused way by never telling the foreign spies the truth,
but letting it more and more be guessed.  The better part of him
(what was left of it) would still say:  `I have not helped the enemy;
I said it was the left drawer.'  The meaner part of him would already
be saying:  `But they may have the sense to see that means the right.'
I think it is psychologically possible--in an enlightened age, you know."

     "It may be psychologically possible," answered Flambeau,
"and it certainly would explain Dreyfus being certain he was wronged
and his judges being sure he was guilty.  But it won't wash historically,
because Dreyfus's document (if it was his document) was literally correct."

     "I wasn't thinking of Dreyfus," said Father Brown.

     Silence had sunk around them with the emptying of the tables;
it was already late, though the sunlight still clung to everything,
as if accidentally entangled in the trees.  In the stillness Flambeau
shifted his seat sharply--making an isolated and echoing noise--
and threw his elbow over the angle of it.  "Well," he said, rather harshly,
"if Hirsch is not better than a timid treason-monger..."

     "You mustn't be too hard on them," said Father Brown gently.
"It's not entirely their fault; but they have no instincts.
I mean those things that make a woman refuse to dance with a man
or a man to touch an investment.  They've been taught that
it's all a matter of degree."

     "Anyhow," cried Flambeau impatiently, "he's not a patch
on my principal; and I shall go through with it.  Old Dubosc may be
a bit mad, but he's a sort of patriot after all."

     Father Brown continued to consume whitebait.

     Something in the stolid way he did so caused Flambeau's
fierce black eyes to ramble over his companion afresh.  "What's the matter
with you?" Flambeau demanded.  "Dubosc's all right in that way.
You don't doubt him?"

     "My friend," said the small priest, laying down his knife and fork
in a kind of cold despair, "I doubt everything.  Everything, I mean,
that has happened today.  I doubt the whole story, though it has been
acted before my face.  I doubt every sight that my eyes have seen
since morning.  There is something in this business quite different
from the ordinary police mystery where one man is more or less lying
and the other man more or less telling the truth.  Here both men....
Well!  I've told you the only theory I can think of that could
satisfy anybody.  It doesn't satisfy me."

     "Nor me either," replied Flambeau frowning, while the other
went on eating fish with an air of entire resignation.  "If all you
can suggest is that notion of a message conveyed by contraries,
I call it uncommonly clever, but...well, what would you call it?"

     "I should call it thin," said the priest promptly.
"I should call it uncommonly thin.  But that's the queer thing
about the whole business.  The lie is like a schoolboy's.
There are only three versions, Dubosc's and Hirsch's and that fancy of mine.
Either that note was written by a French officer to ruin a French official;
or it was written by the French official to help German officers;
or it was written by the French official to mislead German officers.
Very well.  You'd expect a secret paper passing between such people,
officials or officers, to look quite different from that.
You'd expect, probably a cipher, certainly abbreviations;
most certainly scientific and strictly professional terms.
But this thing's elaborately simple, like a penny dreadful:
`In the purple grotto you will find the golden casket.' It looks as if...
as if it were meant to be seen through at once."

     Almost before they could take it in a short figure in French uniform
had walked up to their table like the wind, and sat down
with a sort of thump.

     "I have extraordinary news," said the Duc de Valognes.
"I have just come from this Colonel of ours.  He is packing up
to leave the country, and he asks us to make his excuses sur le terrain."

     "What?" cried Flambeau, with an incredulity quite frightful--
"apologize?"

     "Yes," said the Duke gruffly; "then and there--before everybody--
when the swords are drawn.  And you and I have to do it while
he is leaving the country."

     "But what can this mean?" cried Flambeau.  "He can't be afraid of
that little Hirsch!  Confound it!" he cried, in a kind of rational rage;
"nobody could be afraid of Hirsch!"

     "I believe it's some plot!" snapped Valognes--"some plot of
the Jews and Freemasons.  It's meant to work up glory for Hirsch..."

     The face of Father Brown was commonplace, but curiously contented;
it could shine with ignorance as well as with knowledge.
But there was always one flash when the foolish mask fell,
and the wise mask fitted itself in its place; and Flambeau,
who knew his friend, knew that his friend had suddenly understood.
Brown said nothing, but finished his plate of fish.

     "Where did you last see our precious Colonel?" asked Flambeau,
irritably.

     "He's round at the Hotel Saint Louis by the Elysee,
where we drove with him.  He's packing up, I tell you."

     "Will he be there still, do you think?" asked Flambeau,
frowning at the table.

     "I don't think he can get away yet," replied the Duke;
"he's packing to go a long journey..."

     "No," said Father Brown, quite simply, but suddenly standing up,
"for a very short journey.  For one of the shortest, in fact.
But we may still be in time to catch him if we go there in a motor-cab."

     Nothing more could be got out of him until the cab swept
round the corner by the Hotel Saint Louis, where they got out,
and he led the party up a side lane already in deep shadow with
the growing dusk.  Once, when the Duke impatiently asked whether
Hirsch was guilty of treason or not, he answered rather absently:
"No; only of ambition--like Caesar." Then he somewhat inconsequently added:
"He lives a very lonely life; he has had to do everything for himself."

     "Well, if he's ambitious, he ought to be satisfied now,"
said Flambeau rather bitterly.  "All Paris will cheer him
now our cursed Colonel has turned tail."

     "Don't talk so loud," said Father Brown, lowering his voice,
"your cursed Colonel is just in front."

     The other two started and shrank farther back into the shadow
of the wall, for the sturdy figure of their runaway principal
could indeed be seen shuffling along in the twilight in front,
a bag in each hand.  He looked much the same as when they first saw him,
except that he had changed his picturesque mountaineering knickers
for a conventional pair of trousers.  It was clear he was already
escaping from the hotel.

     The lane down which they followed him was one of those that
seem to be at the back of things, and look like the wrong side
of the stage scenery.  A colourless, continuous wall ran down
one flank of it, interrupted at intervals by dull-hued and
dirt-stained doors, all shut fast and featureless save for
the chalk scribbles of some passing gamin.  The tops of trees,
mostly rather depressing evergreens, showed at intervals over
the top of the wall, and beyond them in the grey and purple gloaming
could be seen the back of some long terrace of tall Parisian houses,
really comparatively close, but somehow looking as inaccessible
as a range of marble mountains.  On the other side of the lane ran
the high gilt railings of a gloomy park.

     Flambeau was looking round him in rather a weird way.
"Do you know," he said, "there is something about this place that--"

     "Hullo!" called out the Duke sharply; "that fellow's disappeared.
Vanished, like a blasted fairy!"

     "He has a key," explained their clerical friend.  "He's only gone
into one of these garden doors," and as he spoke they heard one of
the dull wooden doors close again with a click in front of them.

     Flambeau strode up to the door thus shut almost in his face,
and stood in front of it for a moment, biting his black moustache
in a fury of curiosity.  Then he threw up his long arms and
swung himself aloft like a monkey and stood on the top of the wall,
his enormous figure dark against the purple sky, like the dark tree-tops.

     The Duke looked at the priest.  "Dubosc's escape is
more elaborate than we thought," he said; "but I suppose he is
escaping from France."

     "He is escaping from everywhere," answered Father Brown.

     Valognes's eyes brightened, but his voice sank.  "Do you mean
suicide?" he asked.

     "You will not find his body," replied the other.

     A kind of cry came from Flambeau on the wall above.
"My God," he exclaimed in French, "I know what this place is now!
Why, it's the back of the street where old Hirsch lives.  I thought
I could recognize the back of a house as well as the back of a man."

     "And Dubosc's gone in there!" cried the Duke, smiting his hip.
"Why, they'll meet after all!" And with sudden Gallic vivacity
he hopped up on the wall beside Flambeau and sat there positively
kicking his legs with excitement.  The priest alone remained below,
leaning against the wall, with his back to the whole theatre of events,
and looking wistfully across to the park palings and the twinkling,
twilit trees.

     The Duke, however stimulated, had the instincts of an aristocrat,
and desired rather to stare at the house than to spy on it;
but Flambeau, who had the instincts of a burglar (and a detective),
had already swung himself from the wall into the fork of a straggling tree
from which he could crawl quite close to the only illuminated window
in the back of the high dark house.  A red blind had been pulled down
over the light, but pulled crookedly, so that it gaped on one side,
and by risking his neck along a branch that looked as treacherous
as a twig, Flambeau could just see Colonel Dubosc walking about
in a brilliantly-lighted and luxurious bedroom.  But close as Flambeau was
to the house, he heard the words of his colleagues by the wall,
and repeated them in a low voice.

     "Yes, they will meet now after all!"

     "They will never meet," said Father Brown.  "Hirsch was right
when he said that in such an affair the principals must not meet.
Have you read a queer psychological story by Henry James,
of two persons who so perpetually missed meeting each other by accident
that they began to feel quite frightened of each other, and to think
it was fate?  This is something of the kind, but more curious."

     "There are people in Paris who will cure them of such morbid fancies,"
said Valognes vindictively.  "They will jolly well have to meet
if we capture them and force them to fight."

     "They will not meet on the Day of Judgement," said the priest.
"If God Almighty held the truncheon of the lists, if St Michael
blew the trumpet for the swords to cross--even then, if one of them
stood ready, the other would not come."

     "Oh, what does all this mysticism mean?" cried the Duc de Valognes,
impatiently; "why on earth shouldn't they meet like other people?"

     "They are the opposite of each other," said Father Brown,
with a queer kind of smile.  "They contradict each other.
They cancel out, so to speak."

     He continued to gaze at the darkening trees opposite, but Valognes
turned his head sharply at a suppressed exclamation from Flambeau.
That investigator, peering into the lighted room, had just seen
the Colonel, after a pace or two, proceed to take his coat off.
Flambeau's first thought was that this really looked like a fight;
but he soon dropped the thought for another.  The solidity and
squareness of Dubosc's chest and shoulders was all a powerful piece
of padding and came off with his coat.  In his shirt and trousers
he was a comparatively slim gentleman, who walked across the bedroom to
the bathroom with no more pugnacious purpose than that of washing himself.
He bent over a basin, dried his dripping hands and face on a towel,
and turned again so that the strong light fell on his face.
His brown complexion had gone, his big black moustache had gone;
he--was clean-shaven and very pate.  Nothing remained of the Colonel
but his bright, hawk-like, brown eyes.  Under the wall Father Brown
was going on in heavy meditation, as if to himself.

     "It is all just like what I was saying to Flambeau.
These opposites won't do.  They don't work.  They don't fight.
If it's white instead of black, and solid instead of liquid,
and so on all along the line--then there's something wrong, Monsieur,
there's something wrong.  One of these men is fair and the other dark,
one stout and the other slim, one strong and the other weak.
One has a moustache and no beard, so you can't see his mouth;
the other has a beard and no moustache, so you can't see his chin.
One has hair cropped to his skull, but a scarf to hide his neck;
the other has low shirt-collars, but long hair to bide his skull.
It's all too neat and correct, Monsieur, and there's something wrong.
Things made so opposite are things that cannot quarrel.
Wherever the one sticks out the other sinks in.  Like a face and a mask,
like a lock and a key..."

     Flambeau was peering into the house with a visage as white as a sheet.
The occupant of the room was standing with his back to him,
but in front of a looking-glass, and had already fitted round his face
a sort of framework of rank red hair, hanging disordered from the head and
clinging round the jaws and chin while leaving the mocking mouth uncovered.
Seen thus in the glass the white face looked like the face of Judas
laughing horribly and surrounded by capering flames of hell.
For a spasm Flambeau saw the fierce, red-brown eyes dancing,
then they were covered with a pair of blue spectacles.  Slipping on
a loose black coat, the figure vanished towards the front of the house.
A few moments later a roar of popular applause from the street beyond
announced that Dr Hirsch had once more appeared upon the balcony.




IV. The Man in the Passage


TWO men appeared simultaneously at the two ends of a sort of passage
running along the side of the Apollo Theatre in the Adelphi.
The evening daylight in the streets was large and luminous,
opalescent and empty.  The passage was comparatively long and dark,
so each man could see the other as a mere black silhouette at the other end.
Nevertheless, each man knew the other, even in that inky outline;
for they were both men of striking appearance and they hated each other.

     The covered passage opened at one end on one of the steep streets
of the Adelphi, and at the other on a terrace overlooking
the sunset-coloured river.  One side of the passage was a blank wall,
for the building it supported was an old unsuccessful theatre restaurant,
now shut up.  The other side of the passage contained two doors,
one at each end.  Neither was what was commonly called the stage door;
they were a sort of special and private stage doors used by
very special performers, and in this case by the star actor
and actress in the Shakespearean performance of the day.
Persons of that eminence often like to have such private exits
and entrances, for meeting friends or avoiding them.

     The two men in question were certainly two such friends,
men who evidently knew the doors and counted on their opening,
for each approached the door at the upper end with equal coolness
and confidence.  Not, however, with equal speed; but the man
who walked fast was the man from the other end of the tunnel,
so they both arrived before the secret stage door almost at
the same instant.  They saluted each other with civility,
and waited a moment before one of them, the sharper walker
who seemed to have the shorter patience, knocked at the door.

     In this and everything else each man was opposite and neither
could be called inferior.  As private persons both were handsome,
capable and popular.  As public persons, both were in the first public rank.
But everything about them, from their glory to their good looks,
was of a diverse and incomparable kind.  Sir Wilson Seymour was
the kind of man whose importance is known to everybody who knows.
The more you mixed with the innermost ring in every polity or profession,
the more  often you met Sir Wilson Seymour.  He was the one intelligent man
on twenty unintelligent committees--on every sort of subject,
from the reform of the Royal Academy to the project of bimetallism
for Greater Britain.  In the Arts especially he was omnipotent.
He was so unique that nobody could quite decide whether he was
a great aristocrat who had taken up Art, or a great artist whom
the aristocrats had taken up.  But you could not meet him for five minutes
without realizing that you had really been ruled by him all your life.

     His appearance was "distinguished" in exactly the same sense;
it was at once conventional and unique.  Fashion could have found no fault
with his high silk hat--, yet it was unlike anyone else's hat--
a little higher, perhaps, and adding something to his natural height.
His tall, slender figure had a slight stoop yet it looked
the reverse of feeble.  His hair was silver-grey, but he did not look old;
it was worn longer than the common yet he did not look effeminate;
it was curly but it did not look curled.  His carefully pointed beard
made him look more manly and militant than otherwise, as it does in those
old admirals of Velazquez with whose dark portraits his house was hung.
His grey gloves were a shade bluer, his silver-knobbed cane a shade longer
than scores of such gloves and canes flapped and flourished about
the theatres and the restaurants.

     The other man was not so tall, yet would have struck nobody as short,
but merely as strong and handsome.  His hair also was curly,
but fair and cropped close to a strong, massive head--the sort of head
you break a door with, as Chaucer said of the Miller's.
His military moustache and the carriage of his shoulders
showed him a soldier, but he had a pair of those peculiar frank
and piercing blue eyes which are more common in sailors.
His face was somewhat square, his jaw was square, his shoulders
were square, even his jacket was square.  Indeed, in the wild school
of caricature then current, Mr Max Beerbohm had represented him as
a proposition in the fourth book of Euclid.

     For he also was a public man, though with quite another
sort of success.  You did not have to be in the best society
to have heard of Captain Cutler, of the siege of Hong-Kong,
and the great march across China.  You could not get away from
hearing of him wherever you were; his portrait was on every other postcard;
his maps and battles in every other illustrated paper; songs in his honour
in every other music-hall turn or on every other barrel-organ.
His fame, though probably more temporary, was ten times more wide,
popular and spontaneous than the other man's.  In thousands of
English homes he appeared enormous above England, like Nelson.
Yet he had infinitely less power in England than Sir Wilson Seymour.

     The door was opened to them by an aged servant or "dresser",
whose broken-down face and figure and black shabby coat and trousers
contrasted queerly with the glittering interior of the great actress's
dressing-room.  It was fitted and filled with looking-glasses
at every angle of refraction, so that they looked like the hundred facets
of one huge diamond--if one could get inside a diamond.
The other features of luxury, a few flowers, a few coloured cushions,
a few scraps of stage costume, were multiplied by all the mirrors into
the madness of the Arabian Nights, and danced and changed places
perpetually as the shuffling attendant shifted a mirror outwards
or shot one back against the wall.

     They both spoke to the dingy dresser by name, calling him Parkinson,
and asking for the lady as Miss Aurora Rome.  Parkinson said she was
in the other room, but he would go and tell her.  A shade crossed the brow
of both visitors; for the other room was the private room of
the great actor with whom Miss Aurora was performing, and she was
of the kind that does not inflame admiration without inflaming jealousy.
In about half a minute, however, the inner door opened, and she entered
as she always did, even in private life, so that the very silence
seemed to be a roar of applause, and one well-deserved.
She was clad in a somewhat strange garb of peacock green and
peacock blue satins, that gleamed like blue and green metals,
such as delight children and aesthetes, and her heavy, hot brown hair
framed one of those magic faces which are dangerous to all men,
but especially to boys and to men growing grey.  In company with
her male colleague, the great American actor, Isidore Bruno,
she was producing a particularly poetical and fantastic interpretation
of Midsummer Night's Dream:  in which the artistic prominence was given
to Oberon and Titania, or in other words to Bruno and herself.
Set in dreamy and exquisite scenery, and moving in mystical dances,
the green costume, like burnished beetle-wings, expressed all the
elusive individuality of an elfin queen.  But when personally confronted
in what was still broad daylight, a man looked only at the woman's face.

     She greeted both men with the beaming and baffling smile
which kept so many males at the same just dangerous distance from her.
She accepted some flowers from Cutler, which were as tropical and expensive
as his victories; and another sort of present from Sir Wilson Seymour,
offered later on and more nonchalantly by that gentleman.
For it was against his breeding to show eagerness, and against his
conventional unconventionality to give anything so obvious as flowers.
He had picked up a trifle, he said, which was rather a curiosity,
it was an ancient Greek dagger of the Mycenaean Epoch, and might well
have been worn in the time of Theseus and Hippolyta.  It was made of brass
like all the Heroic weapons, but, oddly enough, sharp enough
to prick anyone still.  He had really been attracted to it by
the leaf-like shape; it was as perfect as a Greek vase.
If it was of any interest to Miss Rome or could come in anywhere
in the play, he hoped she would--

     The inner door burst open and a big figure appeared, who was
more of a contrast to the explanatory Seymour than even Captain Cutler.
Nearly six-foot-six, and of more than theatrical thews and muscles,
Isidore Bruno, in the gorgeous leopard skin and golden-brown garments
of Oberon, looked like a barbaric god.  He leaned on a sort of
hunting-spear, which across a theatre looked a slight, silvery wand,
but which in the small and comparatively crowded room looked as plain as
a pike-staff--and as menacing.  His vivid black eyes rolled volcanically,
his bronzed face, handsome as it was, showed at that moment
a combination of high cheekbones with set white teeth, which recalled
certain American conjectures about his origin in the Southern plantations.

     "Aurora," he began, in that deep voice like a drum of passion
that had moved so many audiences, "will you--"

     He stopped indecisively because a sixth figure had suddenly
presented itself just inside the doorway--a figure so incongruous
in the scene as to be almost comic.  It was a very short man in
the black uniform of the Roman secular clergy, and looking
(especially in such a presence as Bruno's and Aurora's) rather like
the wooden Noah out of an ark.  He did not, however, seem conscious
of any contrast, but said with dull civility: "I believe Miss Rome
sent for me."

     A shrewd observer might have remarked that the emotional temperature
rather rose at so unemotional an interruption.  The detachment of
a professional celibate seemed to reveal to the others that they
stood round the woman as a ring of amorous rivals; just as a stranger
coming in with frost on his coat will reveal that a room is like a furnace.
The presence of the one man who did not care about her
increased Miss Rome's sense that everybody else was in love with her,
and each in a somewhat dangerous way:  the actor with all the appetite
of a savage and a spoilt child; the soldier with all the simple selfishness
of a man of will rather than mind; Sir Wilson with that daily hardening
concentration with which old Hedonists take to a hobby; nay,
even the abject Parkinson, who had known her before her triumphs,
and who followed her about the room with eyes or feet,
with the dumb fascination of a dog.

     A shrewd person might also have noted a yet odder thing.
The man like a black wooden Noah (who was not wholly without shrewdness)
noted it with a considerable but contained amusement.  It was evident
that the great Aurora, though by no means indifferent to the admiration
of the other sex, wanted at this moment to get rid of all the men
who admired her and be left alone with the man who did not--
did not admire her in that sense at least; for the little priest
did admire and even enjoy the firm feminine diplomacy with which
she set about her task.  There was, perhaps, only one thing
that Aurora Rome was clever about, and that was one half of humanity--
the other half.  The little priest watched, like a Napoleonic campaign,
the swift precision of her policy for expelling all while banishing none.
Bruno, the big actor, was so babyish that it was easy to send him off
in brute sulks, banging the door.  Cutler, the British officer,
was pachydermatous to ideas, but punctilious about behaviour.
He would ignore all hints, but he would die rather than
ignore a definite commission from a lady.  As to old Seymour,
he had to be treated differently; he had to be left to the last.
The only way to move him was to appeal to him in confidence as an old
friend, to let him into the secret of the clearance.  The priest did
really admire Miss Rome as she achieved all these three objects
in one selected action.

     She went across to Captain Cutler and said in her sweetest manner:
"I shall value all these flowers, because they must be your
favourite flowers.  But they won't be complete, you know,
without my favourite flower.  Do go over to that shop round the corner
and get me some lilies-of-the-valley, and then it will be quite lovely."

     The first object of her diplomacy, the exit of the enraged Bruno,
was at once achieved.  He had already handed his spear in a lordly style,
like a sceptre, to the piteous Parkinson, and was about to assume
one of the cushioned seats like a throne.  But at this open appeal to
his rival there glowed in his opal eyeballs all the sensitive insolence
of the slave; he knotted his enormous brown fists for an instant,
and then, dashing open the door, disappeared into his own apartments beyond.
But meanwhile Miss Rome's experiment in mobilizing the British Army
had not succeeded so simply as seemed probable.  Cutler had indeed
risen stiffly and suddenly, and walked towards the door, hatless,
as if at a word of command.  But perhaps there was something
ostentatiously elegant about the languid figure of Seymour leaning against
one of the looking-glasses that brought him up short at the entrance,
turning his head this way and that like a bewildered bulldog.

     "I must show this stupid man where to go," said Aurora
in a whisper to Seymour, and ran out to the threshold to speed
the parting guest.

     Seymour seemed to be listening, elegant and unconscious
as was his posture, and he seemed relieved when he heard the lady call out
some last instructions to the Captain, and then turn sharply
and run laughing down the passage towards the other end,
the end on the terrace above the Thames.  Yet a second or two after
Seymour's brow darkened again.  A man in his position has so many rivals,
and he remembered that at the other end of the passage was
the corresponding entrance to Bruno's private room.  He did not
lose his dignity; he said some civil words to Father Brown
about the revival of Byzantine architecture in the Westminster Cathedral,
and then, quite naturally, strolled out himself into the upper end
of the passage.  Father Brown and Parkinson were left alone,
and they were neither of them men with a taste for superfluous conversation.
The dresser went round the room, pulling out looking-glasses
and pushing them in again, his dingy dark coat and trousers looking
all the more dismal since he was still holding the festive fairy spear
of King Oberon.  Every time he pulled out the frame of a new glass,
a new black figure of Father Brown appeared; the absurd glass chamber
was full of Father Browns, upside down in the air like angels,
turning somersaults like acrobats, turning their backs to everybody
like very rude persons.

     Father Brown seemed quite unconscious of this cloud of witnesses,
but followed Parkinson with an idly attentive eye till he took himself
and his absurd spear into the farther room of Bruno.  Then he abandoned
himself to such abstract meditations as always amused him--
calculating the angles of the mirrors, the angles of each refraction,
the angle at which each must fit into the wall...when he heard
a strong but strangled cry.

     He sprang to his feet and stood rigidly listening.
At the same instant Sir Wilson Seymour burst back into the room,
white as ivory.  "Who's that man in the passage?" he cried.
"Where's that dagger of mine?"

     Before Father Brown could turn in his heavy boots Seymour was
plunging about the room looking for the weapon.  And before he could
possibly find that weapon or any other, a brisk running of feet
broke upon the pavement outside, and the square face of Cutler
was thrust into the same doorway.  He was still grotesquely grasping
a bunch of lilies-of-the-valley.  "What's this?" he cried.
"What's that creature down the passage?  Is this some of your tricks?"

     "My tricks!" hissed his pale rival, and made a stride towards him.

     In the instant of time in which all this happened Father Brown
stepped out into the top of the passage, looked down it,
and at once walked briskly towards what he saw.

     At this the other two men dropped their quarrel and darted after him,
Cutler calling out:  "What are you doing?  Who are you?"

     "My name is Brown," said the priest sadly, as he bent over something
and straightened himself again.  "Miss Rome sent for me,
and I came as quickly as I could.  I have come too late."

     The three men looked down, and in one of them at least
the life died in that late light of afternoon.  It ran along
the passage like a path of gold, and in the midst of it Aurora Rome lay
lustrous in her robes of green and gold, with her dead face
turned upwards.  Her dress was torn away as in a struggle,
leaving the right shoulder bare, but the wound from which
the blood was welling was on the other side.  The brass dagger
lay flat and gleaming a yard or so away.

     There was a blank stillness for a measurable time, so that
they could hear far off a flower-girl's laugh outside Charing Cross,
and someone whistling furiously for a taxicab in one of the streets
off the Strand.  Then the Captain, with a movement so sudden that it
might have been passion or play-acting, took Sir Wilson Seymour by the
throat.

     Seymour looked at him steadily without either fight or fear.
"You need not kill me," he said in a voice quite cold; "I shall do
that on my own account."

     The Captain's hand hesitated and dropped; and the other added
with the same icy candour:  "If I find I haven't the nerve
to do it with that dagger I can do it in a month with drink."

     "Drink isn't good enough for me," replied Cutler, "but I'll have
blood for this before I die.  Not yours--but I think I know whose."

     And before the others could appreciate his intention
he snatched up the dagger, sprang at the other door at the lower end
of the passage, burst it open, bolt and all, and confronted Bruno
in his dressing-room.  As he did so, old Parkinson tottered
in his wavering way out of the door and caught sight of the corpse
lying in the passage.  He moved shakily towards it; looked at it weakly
with a working face; then moved shakily back into the dressing-room again,
and sat down suddenly on one of the richly cushioned chairs.
Father Brown instantly ran across to him, taking no notice of Cutler
and the colossal actor, though the room already rang with their blows
and they began to struggle for the dagger.  Seymour, who retained some
practical sense, was whistling for the police at the end of the passage.

     When the police arrived it was to tear the two men
from an almost ape-like grapple; and, after a few formal inquiries,
to arrest Isidore Bruno upon a charge of murder, brought against him
by his furious opponent.  The idea that the great national hero of the hour
had arrested a wrongdoer with his own hand doubtless had its weight
with the police, who are not without elements of the journalist.
They treated Cutler with a certain solemn attention, and pointed out
that he had got a slight slash on the hand.  Even as Cutler
bore him back across tilted chair and table, Bruno had twisted
the dagger out of his grasp and disabled him just below the wrist.
The injury was really slight, but till he was removed from the room
the half-savage prisoner stared at the running blood with a steady smile.

     "Looks a cannibal sort of chap, don't he?" said the constable
confidentially to Cutler.

     Cutler made no answer, but said sharply a moment after:
"We must attend to the...the death..." and his voice escaped
from articulation.

     "The two deaths," came in the voice of the priest from
the farther side of the room.  "This poor fellow was gone
when I got across to him." And he stood looking down at old Parkinson,
who sat in a black huddle on the gorgeous chair.  He also had
paid his tribute, not without eloquence, to the woman who had died.

     The silence was first broken by Cutler, who seemed not untouched
by a rough tenderness.  "I wish I was him," he said huskily.
"I remember he used to watch her wherever she walked more than--anybody.
She was his air, and he's dried up.  He's just dead."

     "We are all dead," said Seymour in a strange voice,
looking down the road.

     They took leave of Father Brown at the corner of the road,
with some random apologies for any rudeness they might have shown.
Both their faces were tragic, but also cryptic.

     The mind of the little priest was always a rabbit-warren
of wild thoughts that jumped too quickly for him to catch them.
Like the white tail of a rabbit he had the vanishing thought that
he was certain of their grief, but not so certain of their innocence.

     "We had better all be going," said Seymour heavily; "we have done
all we can to help."

     "Will you understand my motives," asked Father Brown quietly,
"if I say you have done all you can to hurt?"

     They both started as if guiltily, and Cutler said sharply:
"To hurt whom?"

     "To hurt yourselves," answered the priest.  "I would not
add to your troubles if it weren't common justice to warn you.
You've done nearly everything you could do to hang yourselves,
if this actor should be acquitted.  They'll be sure to subpoena me;
I shall be bound to say that after the cry was heard each of you
rushed into the room in a wild state and began quarrelling about a dagger.
As far as my words on oath can go, you might either of you have done it.
You hurt yourselves with that; and then Captain Cutler must have
hurt himself with the dagger."

     "Hurt myself!" exclaimed the Captain, with contempt.
"A silly little scratch."

     "Which drew blood," replied the priest, nodding.  "We know there's
blood on the brass now.  And so we shall never know whether there was
blood on it before."

     There was a silence; and then Seymour said, with an emphasis
quite alien to his daily accent:  "But I saw a man in the passage."

     "I know you did," answered the cleric Brown with a face of wood,
"so did Captain Cutler.  That's what seems so improbable."

     Before either could make sufficient sense of it even to answer,
Father Brown had politely excused himself and gone stumping
up the road with his stumpy old umbrella.

     As modern newspapers are conducted, the most honest
and most important news is the police news.  If it be true that
in the twentieth century more space is given to murder than to politics,
it is for the excellent reason that murder is a more serious subject.
But even this would hardly explain the enormous omnipresence and
widely distributed detail of "The Bruno Case," or "The Passage Mystery,"
in the Press of London and the provinces.  So vast was the excitement
that for some weeks the Press really told the truth; and the reports
of examination and cross-examination, if interminable,
even if intolerable are at least reliable.  The true reason,
of course, was the coincidence of persons.  The victim was
a popular actress; the accused was a popular actor; and the accused
had been caught red-handed, as it were, by the most popular soldier
of the patriotic season.  In those extraordinary circumstances
the Press was paralysed into probity and accuracy; and the rest of this
somewhat singular business can practically be recorded from reports
of Bruno's trial.

     The trial was presided over by Mr Justice Monkhouse,
one of those who are jeered at as humorous judges, but who are generally
much more serious than the serious judges, for their levity comes from
a living impatience of professional solemnity; while the serious judge
is really filled with frivolity, because he is filled with vanity.
All the chief actors being of a worldly importance, the barristers
were well balanced; the prosecutor for the Crown was Sir Walter Cowdray,
a heavy, but weighty advocate of the sort that knows how to seem
English and trustworthy, and how to be rhetorical with reluctance.
The prisoner was defended by Mr Patrick Butler, K.C., who was mistaken
for a mere flaneur by those who misunderstood the Irish character--
and those who had not been examined by him.  The medical evidence
involved no contradictions, the doctor, whom Seymour had summoned
on the spot, agreeing with the eminent surgeon who had later
examined the body.  Aurora Rome had been stabbed with some sharp instrument
such as a knife or dagger; some instrument, at least, of which
the blade was short.  The wound was just over the heart, and she had
died instantly.  When the doctor first saw her she could hardly
have been dead for twenty minutes.  Therefore when Father Brown
found her she could hardly have been dead for three.

     Some official detective evidence followed, chiefly concerned with
the presence or absence of any proof of a struggle; the only suggestion
of this was the tearing of the dress at the shoulder, and this did not seem
to fit in particularly well with the direction and finality of the blow.
When these details had been supplied, though not explained,
the first of the important witnesses was called.

     Sir Wilson Seymour gave evidence as he did everything else
that he did at all--not only well, but perfectly.  Though himself
much more of a public man than the judge, he conveyed exactly
the fine shade of self-effacement before the King's justice;
and though everyone looked at him as they would at the Prime Minister
or the Archbishop of Canterbury, they could have said nothing
of his part in it but that it was that of a private gentleman,
with an accent on the noun.  He was also refreshingly lucid,
as he was on the committees.  He had been calling on Miss Rome
at the theatre; he had met Captain Cutler there; they had been joined
for a short time by the accused, who had then returned to his
own dressing-room; they had then been joined by a Roman Catholic priest,
who asked for the deceased lady and said his name was Brown.
Miss Rome had then gone just outside the theatre to the entrance
of the passage, in order to point out to Captain Cutler a flower-shop
at which he was to buy her some more flowers; and the witness
had remained in the room, exchanging a few words with the priest.
He had then distinctly heard the deceased, having sent the Captain
on his errand, turn round laughing and run down the passage
towards its other end, where was the prisoner's dressing-room.
In idle curiosity as to the rapid movement of his friends,
he had strolled out to the head of the passage himself and looked down it
towards the prisoner's door.  Did he see anything in the passage?
Yes; he saw something in the passage.

     Sir Walter Cowdray allowed an impressive interval,
during which the witness looked down, and for all his usual composure
seemed to have more than his usual pallor.  Then the barrister said
in a lower voice, which seemed at once sympathetic and creepy:
"Did you see it distinctly?"

     Sir Wilson Seymour, however moved, had his excellent brains
in full working-order.  "Very distinctly as regards its outline,
but quite indistinctly, indeed not at all, as regards the details
inside the outline.  The passage is of such length that anyone in
the middle of it appears quite black against the light at the other end."
The witness lowered his steady eyes once more and added:
"I had noticed the fact before, when Captain Cutler first entered it."
There was another silence, and the judge leaned forward and made a note.

     "Well," said Sir Walter patiently, "what was the outline like?
Was it, for instance, like the figure of the murdered woman?"

     "Not in the least," answered Seymour quietly.

     "What did it look like to you?"

     "It looked to me," replied the witness, "like a tall man."

     Everyone in court kept his eyes riveted on his pen,
or his umbrella-handle, or his book, or his boots or whatever
he happened to be looking at.  They seemed to be holding their eyes
away from the prisoner by main force; but they felt his figure in the dock,
and they felt it as gigantic.  Tall as Bruno was to the eye,
he seemed to swell taller and taller when an eyes had been
torn away from him.

     Cowdray was resuming his seat with his solemn face,
smoothing his black silk robes, and white silk whiskers.
Sir Wilson was leaving the witness-box, after a few final particulars
to which there were many other witnesses, when the counsel for the defence
sprang up and stopped him.

     "I shall only detain you a moment," said Mr Butler,
who was a rustic-looking person with red eyebrows and an expression
of partial slumber.  "Will you tell his lordship how you knew
it was a man?"

     A faint, refined smile seemed to pass over Seymour's features.
"I'm afraid it is the vulgar test of trousers," he said.
"When I saw daylight between the long legs I was sure it was a man,
after all."

     Butler's sleepy eyes opened as suddenly as some silent explosion.
"After all!" he repeated slowly.  "So you did think at first
it was a woman?"

     Seymour looked troubled for the first time.  "It is hardly
a point of fact," he said, "but if his lordship would like me
to answer for my impression, of course I shall do so.  There was something
about the thing that was not exactly a woman and yet was not quite a man;
somehow the curves were different.  And it had something that looked like
long hair."

     "Thank you," said Mr Butler, K.C., and sat down suddenly,
as if he had got what he wanted.

     Captain Cutler was a far less plausible and composed witness
than Sir Wilson, but his account of the opening incidents was
solidly the same.  He described the return of Bruno to his dressing-room,
the dispatching of himself to buy a bunch of lilies-of-the-valley,
his return to the upper end of the passage, the thing he saw
in the passage, his suspicion of Seymour, and his struggle with Bruno.
But he could give little artistic assistance about the black figure
that he and Seymour had seen.  Asked about its outline, he said he
was no art critic--with a somewhat too obvious sneer at Seymour.
Asked if it was a man or a woman, he said it looked more like a beast--
with a too obvious snarl at the prisoner.  But the man was plainly shaken
with sorrow and sincere anger, and Cowdray quickly excused him
from confirming facts that were already fairly clear.

     The defending counsel also was again brief in his cross-examination;
although (as was his custom) even in being brief, he seemed to take
a long time about it.  "You used a rather remarkable expression," he said,
looking at Cutler sleepily.  "What do you mean by saying that
it looked more like a beast than a man or a woman?"

     Cutler seemed seriously agitated.  "Perhaps I oughtn't to have
said that," he said; "but when the brute has huge humped shoulders
like a chimpanzee, and bristles sticking out of its head like a pig--"

     Mr Butler cut short his curious impatience in the middle.
"Never mind whether its hair was like a pig's," he said,
"was it like a woman's?"

     "A woman's!" cried the soldier.  "Great Scott, no!"

     "The last witness said it was," commented the counsel,
with unscrupulous swiftness.  "And did the figure have any of those
serpentine and semi-feminine curves to which eloquent allusion
has been made?  No?  No feminine curves?  The figure, if I understand you,
was rather heavy and square than otherwise?"

     "He may have been bending forward," said Cutler, in a hoarse
and rather faint voice.

     "Or again, he may not," said Mr Butler, and sat down suddenly
for the second time.

     The third, witness called by Sir Walter Cowdray was
the little Catholic clergyman, so little, compared with the others,
that his head seemed hardly to come above the box, so that it was like
cross-examining a child.  But unfortunately Sir Walter had somehow
got it into his head (mostly by some ramifications of his family's religion)
that Father Brown was on the side of the prisoner, because the prisoner
was wicked and foreign and even partly black.  Therefore he
took Father Brown up sharply whenever that proud pontiff tried
to explain anything; and told him to answer yes or no, and tell
the plain facts without any jesuitry.  When Father Brown began,
in his simplicity, to say who he thought the man in the passage was,
the barrister told him that he did not want his theories.

     "A black shape was seen in the passage.  And you say you saw
the black shape.  Well, what shape was it?"

     Father Brown blinked as under rebuke; but he had long known
the literal nature of obedience.  "The shape," he said, "was short
and thick, but had two sharp, black projections curved upwards
on each side of the head or top, rather like horns, and--"

     "Oh! the devil with horns, no doubt," ejaculated Cowdray,
sitting down in triumphant jocularity.  "It was the devil come
to eat Protestants."

     "No," said the priest dispassionately; "I know who it was."

     Those in court had been wrought up to an irrational,
but real sense of some monstrosity.  They had forgotten the figure
in the dock and thought only of the figure in the passage.
And the figure in the passage, described by three capable
and respectable men who had all seen it, was a shifting nightmare:
one called it a woman, and the other a beast, and the other a devil....

     The judge was looking at Father Brown with level and piercing eyes.
"You are a most extraordinary witness," he said; "but there is something
about you that makes me think you are trying to tell the truth.
Well, who was the man you saw in the passage?"

     "He was myself," said Father Brown.

     Butler, K.C., sprang to his feet in an extraordinary stillness,
and said quite calmly:  "Your lordship will allow me to cross-examine?"
And then, without stopping, he shot at Brown the apparently
disconnected question:  "You have heard about this dagger;
you know the experts say the crime was committed with a short blade?"

     "A short blade," assented Brown, nodding solemnly like an owl,
"but a very long hilt."

     Before the audience could quite dismiss the idea that the priest
had really seen himself doing murder with a short dagger with a long hilt
(which seemed somehow to make it more horrible), he had himself
hurried on to explain.

     "I mean daggers aren't the only things with short blades.
Spears have short blades.  And spears catch at the end of the steel
just like daggers, if they're that sort of fancy spear they had
in theatres; like the spear poor old Parkinson killed his wife with,
just when she'd sent for me to settle their family troubles--
and I came just too late, God forgive me!  But he died penitent--
he just died of being penitent.  He couldn't bear what he'd done."

     The general impression in court was that the little priest,
who was gobbling away, had literally gone mad in the box.
But the judge still looked at him with bright and steady eyes of interest;
and the counsel for the defence went on with his questions unperturbed.

     "If Parkinson did it with that pantomime spear," said Butler,
"he must have thrust from four yards away.  How do you account for
signs of struggle, like the dress dragged off the shoulder?" He had
slipped into treating his mere witness as an expert; but no one
noticed it now.

     "The poor lady's dress was torn," said the witness,
"because it was caught in a panel that slid to just behind her.
She struggled to free herself, and as she did so Parkinson came out
of the prisoner's room and lunged with the spear."

     "A panel?" repeated the barrister in a curious voice.

     "It was a looking-glass on the other side," explained Father Brown.
"When I was in the dressing-room I noticed that some of them
could probably be slid out into the passage."

     There was another vast and unnatural silence, and this time
it was the judge who spoke.  "So you really mean that when you
looked down that passage, the man you saw was yourself--in a mirror?"

     "Yes, my lord; that was what I was trying to say," said Brown,
"but they asked me for the shape; and our hats have corners
just like horns, and so I--"

     The judge leaned forward, his old eyes yet more brilliant,
and said in specially distinct tones:  "Do you really mean to say that
when Sir Wilson Seymour saw that wild what-you-call-him with curves
and a woman's hair and a man's trousers, what he saw was
Sir Wilson Seymour?"

     "Yes, my lord," said Father Brown.

     "And you mean to say that when Captain Cutler saw that chimpanzee
with humped shoulders and hog's bristles, he simply saw himself?"

     "Yes, my lord."

     The judge leaned back in his chair with a luxuriance in which
it was hard to separate the cynicism and the admiration.
"And can you tell us why," he asked, "you should know your own figure
in a looking-glass, when two such distinguished men don't?"

     Father Brown blinked even more painfully than before;
then he stammered:  "Really, my lord, I don't know unless it's because
I don't look at it so often."




V. The Mistake of the Machine


FLAMBEAU and his friend the priest were sitting in the Temple Gardens
about sunset; and their neighbourhood or some such accidental influence
had turned their talk to matters of legal process.  From the problem
of the licence in cross-examination, their talk strayed to Roman and
mediaeval torture, to the examining magistrate in France and
the Third Degree in America.

     "I've been reading," said Flambeau, "of this new psychometric method
they talk about so much, especially in America.  You know what I mean;
they put a pulsometer on a man's wrist and judge by how his heart goes
at the pronunciation of certain words.  What do you think of it?"

     "I think it very interesting," replied Father Brown;
"it reminds me of that interesting idea in the Dark Ages that blood
would flow from a corpse if the murderer touched it."

     "Do you really mean," demanded his friend, "that you think
the two methods equally valuable?"

     "I think them equally valueless," replied Brown.  "Blood flows,
fast or slow, in dead folk or living, for so many more million reasons
than we can ever know.  Blood will have to flow very funnily;
blood will have to flow up the Matterhorn, before I will take it
as a sign that I am to shed it."

     "The method," remarked the other, "has been guaranteed
by some of the greatest American men of science."

     "What sentimentalists men of science are!" exclaimed Father Brown,
"and how much more sentimental must American men of science be!
Who but a Yankee would think of proving anything from heart-throbs?
Why, they must be as sentimental as a man who thinks a woman
is in love with him if she blushes.  That's a test from
the circulation of the blood, discovered by the immortal Harvey;
and a jolly rotten test, too."

     "But surely," insisted Flambeau, "it might point pretty straight
at something or other."

     "There's a disadvantage in a stick pointing straight,"
answered the other.  "What is it?  Why, the other end of the stick
always points the opposite way.  It depends whether you
get hold of the stick by the right end.  I saw the thing done once
and I've never believed in it since." And he proceeded to tell
the story of his disillusionment.

     It happened nearly twenty years before, when he was chaplain
to his co-religionists in a prison in Chicago--where the Irish population
displayed a capacity both for crime and penitence which kept him
tolerably busy.  The official second-in-command under the Governor
was an ex-detective named Greywood Usher, a cadaverous, careful-spoken
Yankee philosopher, occasionally varying a very rigid visage
with an odd apologetic grimace.  He liked Father Brown in
a slightly patronizing way; and Father Brown liked him,
though he heartily disliked his theories.  His theories were
extremely complicated and were held with extreme simplicity.

     One evening he had sent for the priest, who, according to his custom,
took a seat in silence at a table piled and littered with papers,
and waited.  The official selected from the papers a scrap of
newspaper cutting, which he handed across to the cleric,
who read it gravely.  It appeared to be an extract from one of
the pinkest of American Society papers, and ran as follows:

     "Society's brightest widower is once more on the Freak Dinner stunt.
All our exclusive citizens will recall the Perambulator Parade Dinner,
in which Last-Trick Todd, at his palatial home at Pilgrim's Pond,
caused so many of our prominent debutantes to look even younger
than their years.  Equally elegant and more miscellaneous and
large-hearted in social outlook was Last-Trick's show the year previous,
the popular Cannibal Crush Lunch, at which the confections handed round
were sarcastically moulded in the forms of human arms and legs,
and during which more than one of our gayest mental gymnasts was heard
offering to eat his partner.  The witticism which will inspire
this evening is as yet in Mr Todd's pretty reticent intellect,
or locked in the jewelled bosoms of our city's gayest leaders;
but there is talk of a pretty parody of the simple manners and customs
at the other end of Society's scale.  This would be all the more telling,
as hospitable Todd is entertaining in Lord Falconroy, the famous traveller,
a true-blooded aristocrat fresh from England's oak-groves.
Lord Falconroy's travels began before his ancient feudal title
was resurrected, he was in the Republic in his youth, and fashion murmurs
a sly reason for his return.  Miss Etta Todd is one of our
deep-souled New Yorkers, and comes into an income of nearly
twelve hundred million dollars."

     "Well," asked Usher, "does that interest you?"

     "Why, words rather fail me," answered Father Brown.
"I cannot think at this moment of anything in this world that would
interest me less.  And, unless the just anger of the Republic is
at last going to electrocute journalists for writing like that,
I don't quite see why it should interest you either."

     "Ah!" said Mr Usher dryly, and handing across another
scrap of newspaper.  "Well, does that interest you?"

     The paragraph was headed "Savage Murder of a Warder.
Convict Escapes," and ran:  "Just before dawn this morning
a shout for help was heard in the Convict Settlement at Sequah
in this State.  The authorities, hurrying in the direction of the cry,
found the corpse of the warder who patrols the top of the north wall
of the prison, the steepest and most difficult exit, for which one man
has always been found sufficient.  The unfortunate officer had,
however, been hurled from the high wall, his brains beaten out
as with a club, and his gun was missing.  Further inquiries showed that
one of the cells was empty; it had been occupied by a rather sullen ruffian
giving his name as Oscar Rian.  He was only temporarily detained
for some comparatively trivial assault; but he gave everyone the impression
of a man with a black past and a dangerous future.  Finally,
when daylight bad fully revealed the scene of murder, it was found
that he had written on the wall above the body a fragmentary sentence,
apparently with a finger dipped in blood:  `This was self-defence and
he had the gun.  I meant no harm to him or any man but one.
I am keeping the bullet for Pilgrim's Pond--O.R.'  A man must have used
most fiendish treachery or most savage and amazing bodily daring
to have stormed such a wall in spite of an armed man."

     "Well, the literary style is somewhat improved," admitted the priest
cheerfully, "but still I don't see what I can do for you.
I should cut a poor figure, with my short legs, running about this State
after an athletic assassin of that sort.  I doubt whether
anybody could find him.  The convict settlement at Sequah
is thirty miles from here; the country between is wild and tangled enough,
and the country beyond, where he will surely have the sense to go,
is a perfect no-man's land tumbling away to the prairies.
He may be in any hole or up any tree."

     "He isn't in any hole," said the governor; "he isn't up any tree."

     "Why, how do you know?" asked Father Brown, blinking.

     "Would you like to speak to him?" inquired Usher.

     Father Brown opened his innocent eyes wide.  "He is here?"
he exclaimed.  "Why, how did your men get hold of him?"

     "I got hold of him myself," drawled the American, rising and
lazily stretching his lanky legs before the fire.  "I got hold of him
with the crooked end of a walking-stick.  Don't look so surprised.
I really did.  You know I sometimes take a turn in the country lanes
outside this dismal place; well, I was walking early this evening
up a steep lane with dark hedges and grey-looking ploughed fields
on both sides; and a young moon was up and silvering the road.
By the light of it I saw a man running across the field towards the road;
running with his body bent and at a good mile-race trot.
He appeared to be much exhausted; but when he came to the thick black hedge
he went through it as if it were made of spiders' webs; --or rather
(for I heard the strong branches breaking and snapping like bayonets)
as if he himself were made of stone.  In the instant in which
he appeared up against the moon, crossing the road, I slung my hooked cane
at his legs, tripping him and bringing him down.  Then I blew my whistle
long and loud, and our fellows came running up to secure him."

     "It would have been rather awkward," remarked Brown,
"if you had found he was a popular athlete practising a mile race."

     "He was not," said Usher grimly.  "We soon found out who he was;
but I had guessed it with the first glint of the moon on him."

     "You thought it was the runaway convict," observed the priest simply,
"because you had read in the newspaper cutting that morning that
a convict had run away."

     "I had somewhat better grounds," replied the governor coolly.
"I pass over the first as too simple to be emphasized--
I mean that fashionable athletes do not run across ploughed fields
or scratch their eyes out in bramble hedges.  Nor do they run
all doubled up like a crouching dog.  There were more decisive details
to a fairly well-trained eye.  The man was clad in coarse
and ragged clothes, but they were something more than merely
coarse and ragged.  They were so ill-fitting as to be quite grotesque;
even as he appeared in black outline against the moonrise,
the coat-collar in which his head was buried made him look
like a hunchback, and the long loose sleeves looked as if he had no hands.
It at once occurred to me that he had somehow managed to change
his convict clothes for some confederate's clothes which did not fit him.
Second, there was a pretty stiff wind against which he was running;
so that I must have seen the streaky look of blowing hair, if the hair
had not been very short.  Then I remembered that beyond these
ploughed fields he was crossing lay Pilgrim's Pond, for which
(you will remember) the convict was keeping his bullet;
and I sent my walking-stick flying."

     "A brilliant piece of rapid deduction," said Father Brown;
"but had he got a gun?"

     As Usher stopped abruptly in his walk the priest added apologetically:
"I've been told a bullet is not half so useful without it."

     "He had no gun," said the other gravely; "but that was doubtless
due to some very natural mischance or change of plans.  Probably the
same policy that made him change the clothes made him drop the gun;
he began to repent the coat he had left behind him in the blood
of his victim."

     "Well, that is possible enough," answered the priest.

     "And it's hardly worth speculating on," said Usher,
turning to some other papers, "for we know it's the man by this time."

     His clerical friend asked faintly:  "But how?"  And Greywood Usher
threw down the newspapers and took up the two press-cuttings again.

     "Well, since you are so obstinate," he said, "let's begin
at the beginning.  You will notice that these two cuttings have only
one thing in common, which is the mention of Pilgrim's Pond,
the estate, as you know, of the millionaire Ireton Todd.
You also know that he is a remarkable character; one of those
that rose on stepping-stones--"

     "Of our dead selves to higher things," assented his companion.
"Yes; I know that.  Petroleum, I think."

     "Anyhow," said Usher, "Last-Trick Todd counts for a great deal
in this rum affair."

     He stretched himself once more before the fire and continued talking
in his expansive, radiantly explanatory style.

     "To begin with, on the face of it, there is no mystery here at all.
It is not mysterious, it is not even odd, that a jailbird should
take his gun to Pilgrim's Pond.  Our people aren't like the English,
who will forgive a man for being rich if he throws away money
on hospitals or horses.  Last-Trick Todd has made himself big
by his own considerable abilities; and there's no doubt that
many of those on whom he has shown his abilities would like to
show theirs on him with a shot-gun.  Todd might easily get dropped
by some man he'd never even heard of; some labourer he'd locked out,
or some clerk in a business he'd busted.  Last-Trick is a man
of mental endowments and a high public character; but in this country
the relations of employers and employed are considerably strained.

     "That's how the whole thing looks supposing this Rian
made for Pilgrim's Pond to kill Todd.  So it looked to me,
till another little discovery woke up what I have of the detective in me.
When I had my prisoner safe, I picked up my cane again and strolled down
the two or three turns of country road that brought me to one of
the side entrances of Todd's grounds, the one nearest to the pool
or lake after which the place is named.  It was some two hours ago,
about seven by this time; the moonlight was more luminous,
and I could see the long white streaks of it lying on the mysterious mere
with its grey, greasy, half-liquid shores in which they say
our fathers used to make witches walk until they sank.
I'd forgotten the exact tale; but you know the place I mean;
it lies north of Todd's house towards the wilderness, and has two queer
wrinkled trees, so dismal that they look more like huge fungoids
than decent foliage.  As I stood peering at this misty pool,
I fancied I saw the faint figure of a man moving from the house towards it,
but it was all too dim and distant for one to be certain of the fact,
and still less of the details.  Besides, my attention was very sharply
arrested by something much closer.  I crouched behind the fence
which ran not more than two hundred yards from one wing of
the great mansion, and which was fortunately split in places,
as if specially for the application of a cautious eye.  A door had opened
in the dark bulk of the left wing, and a figure appeared black against
the illuminated interior--a muffled figure bending forward,
evidently peering out into the night.  It closed the door behind it,
and I saw it was carrying a lantern, which threw a patch of imperfect light
on the dress and figure of the wearer.  It seemed to be
the figure of a woman, wrapped up in a ragged cloak and
evidently disguised to avoid notice; there was something very strange
both about the rags and the furtiveness in a person coming out of
those rooms lined with gold.  She took cautiously the curved garden path
which brought her within half a hundred yards of me--, then she stood up
for an instant on the terrace of turf that looks towards the slimy lake,
and holding her flaming lantern above her head she deliberately swung it
three times to and fro as for a signal.  As she swung it the second time
a flicker of its light fell for a moment on her own face,
a face that I knew.  She was unnaturally pale, and her head was bundled
in her borrowed plebeian shawl; but I am certain it was Etta Todd,
the millionaire's daughter.

     "She retraced her steps in equal secrecy and the door
closed behind her again.  I was about to climb the fence and follow,
when I realized that the detective fever that had lured me
into the adventure was rather undignified; and that in a more
authoritative capacity I already held all the cards in my hand.
I was just turning away when a new noise broke on the night.
A window was thrown up in one of the upper floors, but just round
the corner of the house so that I could not see it; and a voice
of terrible distinctness was heard shouting across the dark garden
to know where Lord Falconroy was, for he was missing from every room
in the house.  There was no mistaking that voice.  I have
heard it on many a political platform or meeting of directors;
it was Ireton Todd himself.  Some of the others seemed to have gone
to the lower windows or on to the steps, and were calling up to him
that Falconroy had gone for a stroll down to the Pilgrim's Pond
an hour before, and could not be traced since.  Then Todd cried
`Mighty Murder!' and shut down the window violently; and I could hear him
plunging down the stairs inside.  Repossessing myself of my former
and wiser purpose, I whipped out of the way of the general search
that must follow; and returned here not later than eight o'clock.

     "I now ask you to recall that little Society paragraph
which seemed to you so painfully lacking in interest.  If the convict
was not keeping the shot for Todd, as he evidently wasn't,
it is most likely that he was keeping it for Lord Falconroy;
and it looks as if he had delivered the goods.  No more handy place
to shoot a man than in the curious geological surroundings of that pool,
where a body thrown down would sink through thick slime to a depth
practically unknown.  Let us suppose, then, that our friend
with the cropped hair came to kill Falconroy and not Todd.
But, as I have pointed out, there are many reasons why people in America
might want to kill Todd.  There is no reason why anybody in America
should want to kill an English lord newly landed, except for the one reason
mentioned in the pink paper--that the lord is paying his attentions
to the millionaire's daughter.  Our crop-haired friend,
despite his ill-fitting clothes, must be an aspiring lover.

     "I know the notion will seem to you jarring and even comic;
but that's because you are English.  It sounds to you like saying
the Archbishop of Canterbury's daughter will be married in
St George's, Hanover Square, to a crossing-sweeper on ticket-of-leave.
You don't do justice to the climbing and aspiring power of our
more remarkable citizens.  You see a good-looking grey-haired man
in evening-dress with a sort of authority about him, you know he is
a pillar of the State, and you fancy he had a father.  You are in error.
You do not realize that a comparatively few years ago he may have been
in a tenement or (quite likely) in a jail.  You don't allow for our
national buoyancy and uplift.  Many of our most influential citizens
have not only risen recently, but risen comparatively late in life.
Todd's daughter was fully eighteen when her father first made his pile;
so there isn't really anything impossible in her having a hanger-on
in low life; or even in her hanging on to him, as I think
she must be doing, to judge by the lantern business.  If so,
the hand that held the lantern may not be unconnected with the hand
that held the gun.  This case, sir, will make a noise."

     "Well," said the priest patiently, "and what did you do next?"

     "I reckon you'll be shocked," replied Greywood Usher,
"as I know you don't cotton to the march of science in these matters.
I am given a good deal of discretion here, and perhaps take a little more
than I'm given; and I thought it was an excellent opportunity to test
that Psychometric Machine I told you about.  Now, in my opinion,
that machine can't lie."

     "No machine can lie," said Father Brown; "nor can it tell the truth."

     "It did in this case, as I'll show you," went on Usher positively.
"I sat the man in the ill-fitting clothes in a comfortable chair,
and simply wrote words on a blackboard; and the machine simply
recorded the variations of his pulse; and I simply observed his manner.
The trick is to introduce some word connected with the supposed crime
in a list of words connected with something quite different,
yet a list in which it occurs quite naturally.  Thus I wrote `heron' and
`eagle' and `owl', and when I wrote `falcon' he was tremendously agitated;
and when I began to make an `r' at the end of the word,
that machine just bounded.  Who else in this republic has any reason
to jump at the name of a newly-arrived Englishman like Falconroy
except the man who's shot him?  Isn't that better evidence than
a lot of gabble  from  witnesses--if the evidence of a reliable machine?"

     "You always forget," observed his companion, "that the reliable machine
always has to be worked by an unreliable machine."

     "Why, what do you mean?" asked the detective.

     "I mean Man," said Father Brown, "the most unreliable machine
I know of.  I don't want to be rude; and I don't think you will consider
Man to be an offensive or inaccurate description of yourself.
You say you observed his manner; but how do you know you observed it right?
You say the words have to come in a natural way; but how do you know
that you did it naturally?  How do you know, if you come to that,
that he did not observe your manner?  Who is to prove that you were not
tremendously agitated?  There was no machine tied on to your pulse."

     "I tell you," cried the American in the utmost excitement,
"I was as cool as a cucumber."

     "Criminals also can be as cool as cucumbers," said Brown
with a smile.  "And almost as cool as you."

     "Well, this one wasn't," said Usher, throwing the papers about.
"Oh, you make me tired!"

     "I'm sorry," said the other.  "I only point out what seems
a reasonable possibility.  If you could tell by his manner when
the word that might hang him had come, why shouldn't he tell
from your manner that the word that might hang him was coming?
I should ask for more than words myself before I hanged anybody."

     Usher smote the table and rose in a sort of angry triumph.

     "And that," he cried, "is just what I'm going to give you.
I tried the machine first just in order to test the thing in other ways
afterwards and the machine, sir, is right."

     He paused a moment and resumed with less excitement.
"I rather want to insist, if it comes to that, that so far
I had very little to go on except the scientific experiment.
There was really nothing against the man at all.  His clothes were
ill-fitting, as I've said, but they were rather better, if anything,
than those of the submerged class to which he evidently belonged.
Moreover, under all the stains of his plunging through ploughed fields
or bursting through dusty hedges, the man was comparatively clean.
This might mean, of course, that he had only just broken prison;
but it reminded me more of the desperate decency of the comparatively
respectable poor.  His demeanour was, I am bound to confess,
quite in accordance with theirs.  He was silent and dignified as they are;
he seemed to have a big, but buried, grievance, as they do.
He professed total ignorance of the crime and the whole question;
and showed nothing but a sullen impatience for something sensible
that might come to take him out of his meaningless scrape.
He asked me more than once if he could telephone for a lawyer
who had helped him a long time ago in a trade dispute, and in every sense
acted as you would expect an innocent man to act.  There was nothing
against him in the world except that little finger on the dial
that pointed to the change of his pulse.

     "Then, sir, the machine was on its trial; and the machine was right.
By the time I came with him out of the private room into the vestibule
where all sorts of other people were awaiting examination,
I think he had already more or less made up his mind to clear things up
by something like a confession.  He turned to me and began to say
in a low voice:  `Oh, I can't stick this any more.  If you must know
all about me--'

     "At the same instant one of the poor women sitting on the long bench
stood up, screaming aloud and pointing at him with her finger.
I have never in my life heard anything more demoniacally distinct.
Her lean finger seemed to pick him out as if it were a pea-shooter.
Though the word was a mere howl, every syllable was as clear
as a separate stroke on the clock.

     "`Drugger Davis!' she shouted.  `They've got Drugger Davis!'

     "Among the wretched women, mostly thieves and streetwalkers,
twenty faces were turned, gaping with glee and hate.  If I had never
heard the words, I should have known by the very shock upon his features
that the so-called Oscar Rian had heard his real name.  But I'm not quite
so ignorant, you may be surprised to hear.  Drugger Davis was
one of the most terrible and depraved criminals that ever
baffled our police.  It is certain he had done murder more than once
long before his last exploit with the warder.  But he was never entirely
fixed for it, curiously enough because he did it in the same manner
as those milder--or meaner--crimes for which he was fixed pretty often.
He was a handsome, well-bred-looking brute, as he still is, to some extent;
and he used mostly to go about with barmaids or shop-girls and do them
out of their money.  Very often, though, he went a good deal farther;
and they were found drugged with cigarettes or chocolates and
their whole property missing.  Then came one case where the girl
was found dead; but deliberation could not quite be proved, and,
what was more practical still, the criminal could not be found.
I heard a rumour of his having reappeared somewhere in the opposite
character this time, lending money instead of borrowing it;
but still to such poor widows as he might personally fascinate,
but still with the same bad result for them.  Well, there is
your innocent man, and there is his innocent record.  Even, since then,
four criminals and three warders have identified him and confirmed the story.
Now what have you got to say to my poor little machine after that?
Hasn't the machine done for him?  Or do you prefer to say that the woman
and I have done for him?"

     "As to what you've done for him," replied Father Brown,
rising and shaking himself in a floppy way, "you've saved him from
the electrical chair.  I don't think they can kill Drugger Davis
on that old vague story of the poison; and as for the convict
who killed the warder, I suppose it's obvious that you haven't got him.
Mr Davis is innocent of that crime, at any rate."

     "What do you mean?" demanded the other.  "Why should he be
innocent of that crime?"

     "Why, bless us all!" cried the small man in one of his rare
moments of animation, "why, because he's guilty of the other crimes!
I don't know what you people are made of.  You seem to think that
all sins are kept together in a bag.  You talk as if a miser on Monday
were always a spendthrift on Tuesday.  You tell me this man you have here
spent weeks and months wheedling needy women out of small sums of money;
that he used a drug at the best, and a poison at the worst;
that he turned up afterwards as the lowest kind of moneylender,
and cheated most poor people in the same patient and pacific style.
Let it be granted--let us admit, for the sake of argument,
that he did all this.  If that is so, I will tell you what he didn't do.
He didn't storm a spiked wall against a man with a loaded gun.
He didn't write on the wall with his own hand, to say he had done it.
He didn't stop to state that his justification was self-defence.
He didn't explain that he had no quarrel with the poor warder.
He didn't name the house of the rich man to which he was going with the gun.
He didn't write his own, initials in a man's blood.  Saints alive!
Can't you see the whole character is different, in good and evil?
Why, you don't seem to be like I am a bit.  One would think
you'd never had any vices of your own."

     The amazed American had already parted his lips in protest
when the door of his private and official room was hammered
and rattled in an unceremonious way to which he was totally unaccustomed.

     The door flew open.  The moment before Greywood Usher had been
coming to the conclusion that Father Brown might possibly be mad.
The moment after he began to think he was mad himself.
There burst and fell into his private room a man in the filthiest rags,
with a greasy squash hat still askew on his head, and a shabby green shade
shoved up from one of his eyes, both of which were glaring like a tiger's.
The rest of his face was almost undiscoverable, being masked with
a matted beard and whiskers through which the nose could barely
thrust itself, and further buried in a squalid red scarf or handkerchief.
Mr Usher prided himself on having seen most of the roughest specimens
in the State, but he thought he had never seen such a baboon dressed
as a scarecrow as this.  But, above all, he had never in all his
placid scientific existence heard a man like that speak to him first.

     "See here, old man Usher," shouted the being in the red handkerchief,
"I'm getting tired.  Don't you try any of your hide-and-seek on me;
I don't get fooled any.  Leave go of my guests, and I'll let up
on the fancy clockwork.  Keep him here for a split instant and you'll
feel pretty mean.  I reckon I'm not a man with no pull."

     The eminent Usher was regarding the bellowing monster
with an amazement which had dried up all other sentiments.
The mere shock to his eyes had rendered his ears, almost useless.
At last he rang a bell with a hand of violence.  While the bell was
still strong and pealing, the voice of Father Brown fell soft but distinct.

     "I have a suggestion to make," he said, "but it seems
a little confusing.  I don't know this gentleman--but--
but I think I know him.  Now, you know him--you know him quite well--
but you don't know him--naturally.  Sounds paradoxical, I know."

     "I reckon the Cosmos is cracked," said Usher, and fell asprawl
in his round office chair.

     "Now, see here," vociferated the stranger, striking the table,
but speaking in a voice that was all the more mysterious
because it was comparatively mild and rational though still resounding.
"I won't let you in.  I want--"

     "Who in hell are you?" yelled Usher, suddenly sitting up straight.

     "I think the gentleman's name is Todd," said the priest.

     Then he picked up the pink slip of newspaper.

     "I fear you don't read the Society papers properly," he said,
and began to read out in a monotonous voice, "`Or locked in
the jewelled bosoms of our city's gayest leaders; but there is talk
of a pretty parody of the manners and customs of the other end
of Society's scale.' There's been a big Slum Dinner up at
Pilgrim's Pond tonight; and a man, one of the guests, disappeared.
Mr Ireton Todd is a good host, and has tracked him here,
without even waiting to take off his fancy-dress."

     "What man do you mean?"

     "I mean the man with comically ill-fitting clothes you saw
running across the ploughed field.  Hadn't you better go and
investigate him?  He will be rather impatient to get back to his champagne,
from which he ran away in such a hurry, when the convict with the gun
hove in sight."

     "Do you seriously mean--" began the official.

     "Why, look here, Mr Usher," said Father Brown quietly,
"you said the machine couldn't make a mistake; and in one sense it didn't.
But the other machine did; the machine that worked it.
You assumed that the man in rags jumped at the name of Lord Falconroy,
because he was Lord Falconroy's murderer.  He jumped at the name
of Lord Falconroy because he is Lord Falconroy."

     "Then why the blazes didn't he say so?" demanded the staring Usher.

     "He felt his plight and recent panic were hardly patrician,"
replied the priest, "so he tried to keep the name back at first.
But he was just going to tell it you, when"--and Father Brown looked
down at his boots--"when a woman found another name for him."

     "But you can't be so mad as to say," said Greywood Usher,
very white, "that Lord Falconroy was Drugger Davis."

     The priest looked at him very earnestly, but with a baffling
and undecipherable face.

     "I am not saying anything about it," he said.  "I leave
all the rest to you.  Your pink paper says that the title
was recently revived for him; but those papers are very unreliable.
It says he was in the States in youth; but the whole story seems
very strange.  Davis and Falconroy are both pretty considerable cowards,
but so are lots of other men.  I would not hang a dog on my own opinion
about this.  But I think," he went on softly and reflectively,
"I think you Americans are too modest.  I think you idealize
the English aristocracy--even in assuming it to be so aristocratic.
You see a good-looking Englishman in evening-dress; you know
he's in the House of Lords; and you fancy he has a father.
You don't allow for our national buoyancy and uplift.  Many of our
most influential noblemen have not only risen recently, but--"

     "Oh, stop it!" cried Greywood Usher, wringing one lean hand
in impatience against a shade of irony in the other's face.

     "Don't stay talking to this lunatic!" cried Todd brutally.
"Take me to my friend."

     Next morning Father Brown appeared with the same demure expression,
carrying yet another piece of pink newspaper.

     "I'm afraid you neglect the fashionable press rather," he said,
"but this cutting may interest you."

     Usher read the headlines, "Last-Trick's Strayed Revellers:
Mirthful Incident near Pilgrim's Pond." The paragraph went on:
"A laughable occurrence took place outside Wilkinson's Motor Garage
last night.  A policeman on duty had his attention drawn by larrikins
to a man in prison dress who was stepping with considerable coolness
into the steering-seat of a pretty high-toned Panhard; he was accompanied
by a girl wrapped in a ragged shawl.  On the police interfering,
the young woman threw back the shawl, and all recognized
Millionaire Todd's daughter, who had just come from the Slum Freak Dinner
at the Pond, where all the choicest guests were in a similar deshabille.
She and the gentleman who had donned prison uniform were going for
the customary joy-ride."

     Under the pink slip Mr Usher found a strip of a later paper,
headed, "Astounding Escape of Millionaire's Daughter with Convict.
She had Arranged Freak Dinner.  Now Safe in--"

     Mr Greenwood Usher lifted his eyes, but Father Brown was gone.




VI. The Head of Caesar


THERE is somewhere in Brompton or Kensington an interminable avenue
of tall houses, rich but largely empty, that looks like a terrace of tombs.
The very steps up to the dark front doors seem as steep as
the side of pyramids; one would hesitate to knock at the door,
lest it should be opened by a mummy.  But a yet more depressing feature
in the grey facade is its telescopic length and changeless continuity.
The pilgrim walking down it begins to think he will never come to
a break or a corner; but there is one exception--a very small one,
but hailed by the pilgrim almost with a shout.  There is a sort of mews
between two of the tall mansions, a mere slit like the crack of a door
by comparison with the street, but just large enough to permit
a pigmy ale-house or eating-house, still allowed by the rich to their
stable-servants, to stand in the angle.  There is something cheery in its
very dinginess, and something free and elfin in its very insignificance.
At the feet of those grey stone giants it looks like a lighted house
of dwarfs.

     Anyone passing the place during a certain autumn evening,
itself almost fairylike, might have seen a hand pull aside
the red half-blind which (along with some large white lettering)
half hid the interior from the street, and a face peer out not unlike
a rather innocent goblin's.  It was, in fact, the face of one with
the harmless human name of Brown, formerly priest of Cobhole in Essex,
and now working in London.  His friend, Flambeau, a semi-official
investigator, was sitting opposite him, making his last notes of a case
he had cleared up in the neighbourhood.  They were sitting at a small table,
close up to the window, when the priest pulled the curtain back
and looked out.  He waited till a stranger in the street had
passed the window, to let the curtain fall into its place again.
Then his round eyes rolled to the large white lettering on the window
above his head, and then strayed to the next table, at which sat only
a navvy with beer and cheese, and a young girl with red hair and
a glass of milk.  Then (seeing his friend put away the pocket-book),
he said softly:

     "If you've got ten minutes, I wish you'd follow that man with
the false nose."

     Flambeau looked up in surprise; but the girl with the red hair
also looked up, and with something that was stronger than astonishment.
She was simply and even loosely dressed in light brown sacking stuff;
but she was a lady, and even, on a second glance, a rather needlessly
haughty one.  "The man with the false nose!" repeated Flambeau.
"Who's he?"

     "I haven't a notion," answered Father Brown.  "I want you
to find out; I ask it as a favour.  He went down there"--and he jerked
his thumb over his shoulder in one of his undistinguished gestures--
"and can't have passed three lamp-posts yet.  I only want to know
the direction."

     Flambeau gazed at his friend for some time, with an expression
between perplexity and amusement; and then, rising from the table;
squeezed his huge form out of the little door of the dwarf tavern,
and melted into the twilight.

     Father Brown took a small book out of his pocket and began
to read steadily; he betrayed no consciousness of the fact that
the red-haired lady had left her own table and sat down opposite him.
At last she leaned over and said in a low, strong voice:
"Why do you say that?  How do you know it's false?"

     He lifted his rather heavy eyelids, which fluttered in
considerable embarrassment.  Then his dubious eye roamed again to
the white lettering on the glass front of the public-house.
The young woman's eyes followed his, and rested there also,
but in pure puzzledom.

     "No," said Father Brown, answering her thoughts.  "It doesn't say
`Sela', like the thing in the Psalms; I read it like that myself when
I was wool-gathering just now; it says `Ales.'"

     "Well?" inquired the staring young lady.  "What does it matter
what it says?"

     His ruminating eye roved to the girl's light canvas sleeve,
round the wrist of which ran a very slight thread of artistic pattern,
just enough to distinguish it from a working-dress of a common woman
and make it more like the working-dress of a lady art-student.
He seemed to find much food for thought in this; but his reply was
very slow and hesitant.  "You see, madam," he said, "from outside
the place looks--well, it is a perfectly decent place--but ladies
like you don't--don't generally think so.  They never go into such places
from choice, except--"

     "Well?" she repeated.

     "Except an unfortunate few who don't go in to drink milk."

     "You are a most singular person," said the young lady.
"What is your object in all this?"

     "Not to trouble you about it," he replied, very gently.
"Only to arm myself with knowledge enough to help you, if ever
you freely ask my help."

     "But why should I need help?"

     He continued his dreamy monologue.  "You couldn't have come in
to see protegees, humble friends, that sort of thing, or you'd have
gone through into the parlour...and you couldn't have come in because
you were ill, or you'd have spoken to the woman of the place,
who's obviously respectable...besides, you don't look ill in that way,
but only unhappy....  This street is the only original long lane
that has no turning; and the houses on both sides are shut up....
I could only suppose that you'd seen somebody coming whom you didn't want
to meet; and found the public-house was the only shelter in this
wilderness of stone....  I don't think I went beyond the licence of
a stranger in glancing at the only man who passed immediately after....
And as I thought he looked like the wrong sort...and you looked like
the right sort....  I held myself ready to help if he annoyed you;
that is all.  As for my friend, he'll be back soon; and he certainly
can't find out anything by stumping down a road like this....
I didn't think he could."

     "Then why did you send him out?" she cried, leaning forward with
yet warmer curiosity.  She had the proud, impetuous face that goes
with reddish colouring, and a Roman nose, as it did in Marie Antoinette.

     He looked at her steadily for the first time, and said:
"Because I hoped you would speak to me."

     She looked back at him for some time with a heated face,
in which there hung a red shadow of anger; then, despite her anxieties,
humour broke out of her eyes and the corners of her mouth,
and she answered almost grimly:  "Well, if you're so keen on
my conversation, perhaps you'll answer my question."  After a pause
she added:  "I had the honour to ask you why you thought the man's nose
was false."

     "The wax always spots like that just a little in this weather,"
answered Father Brown with entire simplicity,

     "But it's such a crooked nose," remonstrated the red-haired girl.

     The priest smiled in his turn.  "I don't say it's the sort of nose
one would wear out of mere foppery," he admitted.  "This man, I think,
wears it because his real nose is so much nicer."

     "But why?" she insisted.

     "What is the nursery-rhyme?" observed Brown absent-mindedly.
"There was a crooked man and he went a crooked mile....  That man,
I fancy, has gone a very crooked road--by following his nose."

     "Why, what's he done?" she demanded, rather shakily.

     "I don't want to force your confidence by a hair," said Father Brown,
very quietly.  "But I think you could tell me more about that than
I can tell you."

     The girl sprang to her feet and stood quite quietly, but with
clenched hands, like one about to stride away; then her hands
loosened slowly, and she sat down again.  "You are more of a mystery
than all the others," she said desperately, "but I feel there might be
a heart in your mystery."

     "What we all dread most," said the priest in a low voice,
"is a maze with no centre.  That is why atheism is only a nightmare."
"I will tell you everything," said the red-haired girl doggedly,
"except why I am telling you; and that I don't know."

     She picked at the darned table-cloth and went on:  "You look as if
you knew what isn't snobbery as well as what is; and when I say that
ours is a good old family, you'll understand it is a necessary part of
the story; indeed, my chief danger is in my brother's high-and-dry notions,
noblesse oblige and all that.  Well, my name is Christabel Carstairs;
and my father was that Colonel Carstairs you've probably heard of,
who made the famous Carstairs Collection of Roman coins.
I could never describe my father to you; the nearest I can say is
that he was very like a Roman coin himself.  He was as handsome and
as genuine and as valuable and as metallic and as out-of-date.
He was prouder of his Collection than of his coat-of-arms--
nobody could say more than that.  His extraordinary character
came out most in his will.  He had two sons and one daughter.
He quarrelled with one son, my brother Giles, and sent him
to Australia on a small allowance.  He then made a will leaving
the Carstairs Collection, actually with a yet smaller allowance,
to my brother Arthur.  He meant it as a reward, as the highest honour
he could offer, in acknowledgement of Arthur's loyalty and rectitude
and the distinctions he had already gained in mathematics and economics
at Cambridge.  He left me practically all his pretty large fortune;
and I am sure he meant it in contempt.

     "Arthur, you may say, might well complain of this; but Arthur
is my father over again.  Though he had some differences with my
father in early youth, no sooner had he taken over the Collection
than he became like a pagan priest dedicated to a temple.
He mixed up these Roman halfpence with the honour of the Carstairs
family in the same stiff, idolatrous way as his father before him.
He acted as if Roman money must be guarded by all the Roman virtues.
He took no pleasures; he spent nothing on himself; he lived for
the Collection.  Often he would not trouble to dress for his simple meals;
but pattered about among the corded brown-paper parcels (which no one else
was allowed to touch) in an old brown dressing-gown.  With its rope
and tassel and his pale, thin, refined face, it made him look like
an old ascetic monk.  Every now and then, though, he would appear
dressed like a decidedly fashionable gentleman; but that was only when
he went up to the London sales or shops to make an addition to
the Carstairs Collection.

     "Now, if you've known any young people, you won't be shocked
if I say that I got into rather a low frame of mind with all this;
the frame of mind in which one begins to say that the Ancient Romans
were all very well in their way.  I'm not like my brother Arthur;
I can't help enjoying enjoyment.  I got a lot of romance and rubbish
where I got my red hair, from the other side of the family.
Poor Giles was the same; and I think the atmosphere of coins
might count in excuse for him; though he really did wrong and nearly
went to prison.  But he didn't behave any worse than I did;
as you shall hear.

     "I come now to the silly part of the story.  I think a man
as clever as you can guess the sort of thing that would begin
to relieve the monotony for an unruly girl of seventeen placed in such
a position.  But I am so rattled with more dreadful things that I can
hardly read my own feeling; and don't know whether I despise it now
as a flirtation or bear it as a broken heart.  We lived then at
a little seaside watering-place in South Wales, and a retired sea-captain
living a few doors off had a son about five years older than myself,
who had been a friend of Giles before he went to the Colonies.
His name does not affect my tale; but I tell you it was Philip Hawker,
because I am telling you everything.  We used to go shrimping together,
and said and thought we were in love with each other; at least
he certainly said he was, and I certainly thought I was.
If I tell you he had bronzed curly hair and a falconish sort of face,
bronzed by the sea also, it's not for his sake, I assure you,
but for the story; for it was the cause of a very curious coincidence.

     "One summer afternoon, when I had promised to go shrimping
along the sands with Philip, I was waiting rather impatiently
in the front drawing-room, watching Arthur handle some packets of coins
he had just purchased and slowly shunt them, one or two at a time,
into his own dark study and museum which was at the back of the house.
As soon as I heard the heavy door close on him finally, I made a bolt
for my shrimping-net and tam-o'-shanter and was just going to slip out,
when I saw that my brother had left behind him one coin that lay
gleaming on the long bench by the window.  It was a bronze coin,
and the colour, combined with the exact curve of the Roman nose
and something in the very lift of the long, wiry neck, made the head
of Caesar on it the almost precise portrait of Philip Hawker.
Then I suddenly remembered Giles telling Philip of a coin that was
like him, and Philip wishing he had it.  Perhaps you can fancy the wild,
foolish thoughts with which my head went round; I felt as if I had
had a gift from the fairies.  It seemed to me that if I could only
run away with this, and give it to Philip like a wild sort of wedding-ring,
it would be a bond between us for ever; I felt a thousand such things
at once.  Then there yawned under me, like the pit, the enormous,
awful notion of what I was doing; above all, the unbearable thought,
which was like touching hot iron, of what Arthur would think of it.
A Carstairs a thief; and a thief of the Carstairs treasure!
I believe my brother could see me burned like a witch for such a thing,
But then, the very thought of such fanatical cruelty heightened
my old hatred of his dingy old antiquarian fussiness and my longing
for the youth and liberty that called to me from the sea.
Outside was strong sunlight with a wind; and a yellow head of some
broom or gorse in the garden rapped against the glass of the window.
I thought of that living and growing gold calling to me from all
the heaths of the world--and then of that dead, dull gold and bronze
and brass of my brother's growing dustier and dustier as life went by.
Nature and the Carstairs Collection had come to grips at last.

     "Nature is older than the Carstairs Collection.  As I ran
down the streets to the sea, the coin clenched tight in my fist,
I felt all the Roman Empire on my back as well as the Carstairs pedigree.
It was not only the old lion argent that was roaring in my ear,
but all the eagles of the Caesars seemed flapping and screaming
in pursuit of me.  And yet my heart rose higher and higher like
a child's kite, until I came over the loose, dry sand-hills and to
the flat, wet sands, where Philip stood already up to his ankles
in the shallow shining water, some hundred yards out to sea.
There was a great red sunset; and the long stretch of low water,
hardly rising over the ankle for half a mile, was like a lake
of ruby flame.  It was not till I had torn off my shoes and stockings
and waded to where he stood, which was well away from the dry land,
that I turned and looked round.  We were quite alone in a circle
of sea-water and wet sand, and I gave him the head of Caesar.

     "At the very instant I had a shock of fancy:  that a man far away
on the sand-hills was looking at me intently.  I must have felt
immediately after that it was a mere leap of unreasonable nerves;
for the man was only a dark dot in the distance, and I could only just see
that he was standing quite still and gazing, with his head a little
on one side.  There was no earthly logical evidence that he was
looking at me; he might have been looking at a ship, or the sunset,
or the sea-gulls, or at any of the people who still strayed here and there
on the shore between us.  Nevertheless, whatever my start sprang from
was prophetic; for, as I gazed, he started walking briskly in a bee-line
towards us across the wide wet sands.  As he drew nearer and nearer
I saw that he was dark and bearded, and that his eyes were marked with
dark spectacles.  He was dressed poorly but respectably in black,
from the old black top hat on his head to the solid black boots
on his feet.  In spite of these he walked straight into the sea
without a flash of hesitation, and came on at me with the steadiness
of a travelling bullet.

     "I can't tell you the sense of monstrosity and miracle I had
when he thus silently burst the barrier between land and water.
It was as if he had walked straight off a cliff and still marched
steadily in mid-air.  It was as if a house had flown up into the sky
or a man's head had fallen off.  He was only wetting his boots;
but he seemed to be a demon disregarding a law of Nature.  If he had
hesitated an instant at the water's edge it would have been nothing.
As it was, he seemed to look so much at me alone as not to notice the ocean.
Philip was some yards away with his back to me, bending over his net.
The stranger came on till he stood within two yards of me, the water
washing half-way up to his knees.  Then he said, with a clearly modulated
and rather mincing articulation:  `Would it discommode you to contribute
elsewhere a coin with a somewhat different superscription?'

     "With one exception there was nothing definably abnormal about him.
His tinted glasses were not really opaque, but of a blue kind common enough,
nor were the eyes behind them shifty, but regarded me steadily.
His dark beard was not really long or wild--, but he looked rather hairy,
because the beard began very high up in his face, just under
the cheek-bones.  His complexion was neither sallow nor livid,
but on the contrary rather clear and youthful; yet this gave
a pink-and-white wax look which somehow (I don't know why) rather
increased the horror.  The only oddity one could fix was that his nose,
which was otherwise of a good shape, was just slightly turned sideways
at the tip; as if, when it was soft, it had been tapped on one side
with a toy hammer.  The thing was hardly a deformity; yet I cannot
tell you what a living nightmare it was to me.  As he stood there
in the sunset-stained water he affected me as some hellish sea-monster
just risen roaring out of a sea like blood.  I don't know why
a touch on the nose should affect my imagination so much.
I think it seemed as if he could move his nose like a finger.
And as if he had just that moment moved it.

     "`Any little assistance,' he continued with the same queer,
priggish accent, `that may obviate the necessity of my communicating
with the family.'

     "Then it rushed over me that I was being blackmailed for
the theft of the bronze piece; and all my merely superstitious fears
and doubts were swallowed up in one overpowering, practical question.
How could he have found out?  I had stolen the thing suddenly and on impulse;
I was certainly alone; for I always made sure of being unobserved
when I slipped out to see Philip in this way.  I had not,
to all appearance, been followed in the street; and if I had,
they could not `X-ray' the coin in my closed hand.  The man standing
on the sand-hills could no more have seen what I gave Philip than
shoot a fly in one eye, like the man in the fairy-tale.

     "`Philip,' I cried helplessly, `ask this man what he wants.'

     "When Philip lifted his head at last from mending his net
he looked rather red, as if sulky or ashamed; but it may have been
only the exertion of stooping and the red evening light; I may have
only had another of the morbid fancies that seemed to be dancing about me.
He merely said gruffly to the man: `You clear out of this.'
And, motioning me to follow, set off wading shoreward without paying
further attention to him.  He stepped on to a stone breakwater that
ran out from among the roots of the sand-hills, and so struck homeward,
perhaps thinking our incubus would find it less easy to walk on such
rough stones, green and slippery with seaweed, than we, who were young
and used to it.  But my persecutor walked as daintily as he talked;
and he still followed me, picking his way and picking his phrases.
I heard his delicate, detestable voice appealing to me over my shoulder,
until at last, when we had crested the sand-hills, Philip's patience
(which was by no means so conspicuous on most occasions) seemed to snap.
He turned suddenly, saying, `Go back.  I can't talk to you now.'
And as the man hovered and opened his mouth, Philip struck him a buffet
on it that sent him flying from the top of the tallest sand-hill
to the bottom.  I saw him crawling out below, covered with sand.

     "This stroke comforted me somehow, though it might well increase
my peril; but Philip showed none of his usual elation at his own prowess.
Though as affectionate as ever, he still seemed cast down; and before
I could ask him anything fully, he parted with me at his own gate,
with two remarks that struck me as strange.  He said that,
all things considered, I ought to put the coin back in the Collection;
but that he himself would keep it `for the present'.  And then he added
quite suddenly and irrelevantly:, `You know Giles is back from Australia?'"

     The door of the tavern opened and the gigantic shadow of
the investigator Flambeau fell across the table.  Father Brown
presented him to the lady in his own slight, persuasive style of speech,
mentioning his knowledge and sympathy in such cases; and almost
without knowing, the girl was soon reiterating her story to two listeners.
But Flambeau, as he bowed and sat down, handed the priest a small slip
of paper.  Brown accepted it with some surprise and read on it:
"Cab to Wagga Wagga, 379, Mafeking Avenue, Putney." The girl was going
on with her story.

     "I went up the steep street to my own house with my head in a whirl;
it had not begun to clear when I came to the doorstep, on which
I found a milk-can--and the man with the twisted nose.  The milk-can
told me the servants were all out; for, of course, Arthur,
browsing about in his brown dressing-gown in a brown study,
would not hear or answer a bell.  Thus there was no one to help me
in the house, except my brother, whose help must be my ruin.
In desperation I thrust two shillings into the horrid thing's hand,
and told him to call again in a few days, when I had thought it out.
He went off sulking, but more sheepishly than I had expected--
perhaps he had been shaken by his fall--and I watched the star of sand
splashed on his back receding down the road with a horrid vindictive
pleasure.  He turned a corner some six houses down.

     "Then I let myself in, made myself some tea, and tried to
think it out.  I sat at the drawing-room window looking on to the garden,
which still glowed with the last full evening light.  But I was too
distracted and dreamy to look at the lawns and flower-pots and flower-beds
with any concentration.  So I took the shock the more sharply because
I'd seen it so slowly.

     "The man or monster I'd sent away was standing quite still
in the middle of the garden.  Oh, we've all read a lot about
pale-faced phantoms in the dark; but this was more dreadful
than anything of that kind could ever be.  Because, though he cast
a long evening shadow, he still stood in warm sunlight.  And because
his face was not pale, but had that waxen bloom still upon it
that belongs to a barber's dummy.  He stood quite still, with his face
towards me; and I can't tell you how horrid he looked among the tulips
and all those tall, gaudy, almost hothouse-looking flowers.
It looked as if we'd stuck up a waxwork instead of a statue in
the centre of our garden.

     "Yet almost the instant he saw me move in the window he turned
and ran out of the garden by the back gate, which stood open and
by which he had undoubtedly entered.  This renewed timidity on his part
was so different from the impudence with which he had walked into the sea,
that I felt vaguely comforted.  I fancied, perhaps, that he feared
confronting Arthur more than I knew.  Anyhow, I settled down at last,
and had a quiet dinner alone (for it was against the rules to
disturb Arthur when he was rearranging the museum), and, my thoughts,
a little released, fled to Philip and lost themselves, I suppose.
Anyhow, I was looking blankly, but rather pleasantly than otherwise,
at another window, uncurtained, but by this time black as a slate
with the final night-fall.  It seemed to me that something like a snail
was on the outside of the window-pane.  But when I stared harder,
it was more like a man's thumb pressed on the pane; it had that curled look
that a thumb has.  With my fear and courage re-awakened together,
I rushed at the window and then recoiled with a strangled scream
that any man but Arthur must have heard.

     "For it was not a thumb, any more than it was a snail.
It was the tip of a crooked nose, crushed against the glass;
it looked white with the pressure; and the staring face and eyes
behind it were at first invisible and afterwards grey like a ghost.
I slammed the shutters together somehow, rushed up to my room and
locked myself in.  But, even as I passed, I could swear I saw
a second black window with something on it that was like a snail.

     "It might be best to go to Arthur after all.  If the thing
was crawling close all around the house like a cat, it might have
purposes worse even than blackmail.  My brother might cast me out
and curse me for ever, but he was a gentleman, and would defend me
on the spot.  After ten minutes' curious thinking, I went down,
knocked on the door and then went in:  to see the last and worst sight.

     "My brother's chair was empty, and he was obviously out.
But the man with the crooked nose was sitting waiting for his return,
with his hat still insolently on his head, and actually reading
one of my brother's books under my brother's lamp.  His face was composed
and occupied, but his nose-tip still had the air of being the most mobile
part of his face, as if it had just turned from left to right like
an elephant's proboscis.  I had thought him poisonous enough while
he was pursuing and watching me; but I think his unconsciousness
of my presence was more frightful still.

     "I think I screamed loud and long; but that doesn't matter.
What I did next does matter:  I gave him all the money I had,
including a good deal in paper which, though it was mine, I dare say
I had no right to touch.  He went off at last, with hateful,
tactful regrets all in long words; and I sat down, feeling ruined
in every sense.  And yet I was saved that very night by a pure accident.
Arthur had gone off suddenly to London, as he so often did, for bargains;
and returned, late but radiant, having nearly secured a treasure
that was an added splendour even to the family Collection.
He was so resplendent that I was almost emboldened to confess
the abstraction of the lesser gem--, but he bore down all other topics
with his over-powering projects.  Because the bargain might still
misfire any moment, he insisted on my packing at once and going up
with him to lodgings he had already taken in Fulham, to be near
the curio-shop in question.  Thus in spite of myself, I fled from my foe
almost in the dead of night--but from Philip also....  My brother
was often at the South Kensington Museum, and, in order to make
some sort of secondary life for myself, I paid for a few lessons
at the Art Schools.  I was coming back from them this evening,
when I saw the abomination of desolation walking alive down
the long straight street and the rest is as this gentleman has said.

     "I've got only one thing to say.  I don't deserve to be helped;
and I don't question or complain of my punishment; it is just,
it ought to have happened.  But I still question, with bursting brains,
how it can have happened.  Am I punished by miracle? or how can anyone but
Philip and myself know I gave him a tiny coin in the middle of the sea?"

     "It is an extraordinary problem," admitted Flambeau.

     "Not so extraordinary as the answer," remarked Father Brown
rather gloomily.  "Miss Carstairs, will you be at home if we call
at your Fulham place in an hour and a half hence?"

     The girl looked at him, and then rose and put her gloves on.
"Yes," she said, "I'll be there"; and almost instantly left the place.

     That night the detective and the priest were still talking
of the matter as they drew near the Fulham house, a tenement
strangely mean even for a temporary residence of the Carstairs family.

     "Of course the superficial, on reflection," said Flambeau,
"would think first of this Australian brother who's been
in trouble before, who's come back so suddenly and who's just the man
to have shabby confederates.  But I can't see how he can
come into the thing by any process of thought, unless..."

     "Well?" asked his companion patiently.

     Flambeau lowered his voice.  "Unless the girl's lover comes in,
too, and he would be the blacker villain.  The Australian chap
did know that Hawker wanted the coin.  But I can't see how on earth
he could know that Hawker had got it, unless Hawker signalled to him
or his representative across the shore."

     "That is true," assented the priest, with respect.

     "Have you noted another thing?" went on Flambeau eagerly.
"this Hawker hears his love insulted, but doesn't strike till he's got
to the soft sand-hills, where he can be victor in a mere sham-fight.
If he'd struck amid rocks and sea, he might have hurt his ally."

     "That is true again," said Father Brown, nodding.

     "And now, take it from the start.  It lies between few people,
but at least three.  You want one person for suicide; two people
for murder; but at least three people for blackmail"

     "Why?" asked the priest softly.

     "Well, obviously," cried his friend, "there must be one to be exposed;
one to threaten exposure; and one at least whom exposure would horrify."

     After a long ruminant pause, the priest said:  "You miss a logical step.
Three persons are needed as ideas.  Only two are needed as agents."

     "What can you mean?" asked the other.

     "Why shouldn't a blackmailer," asked Brown, in a low voice,
"threaten his victim with himself?  Suppose a wife became
a rigid teetotaller in order to frighten her husband into concealing
his pub-frequenting, and then wrote him blackmailing letters
in another hand, threatening to tell his wife!  Why shouldn't it work?
Suppose a father forbade a son to gamble and then, following him
in a good disguise, threatened the boy with his own sham
paternal strictness!  Suppose--but, here we are, my friend."

     "My God!" cried Flambeau; "you don't mean--"

     An active figure ran down the steps of the house and showed
under the golden lamplight the unmistakable head that resembled
the Roman coin.  "Miss Carstairs," said Hawker without ceremony,
"wouldn't go in till you came."

     "Well," observed Brown confidently, "don't you think it's
the best thing she can do to stop outside--with you to look after her?
You see, I rather guess you have guessed it all yourself."

     "Yes," said the young man, in an undertone, "I guessed
on the sands and now I know; that was why I let him fall soft."

     Taking a latchkey from the girl and the coin from Hawker,
Flambeau let himself and his friend into the empty house and passed
into the outer parlour.  It was empty of all occupants but one.
The man whom Father Brown had seen pass the tavern was standing
against the wall as if at bay; unchanged, save that he had taken off
his black coat and was wearing a brown dressing-gown.

     "We have come," said Father Brown politely, "to give back
this coin to its owner."  And he handed it to the man with the nose.

     Flambeau's eyes rolled.  "Is this man a coin-collector?" he asked.

     "This man is Mr Arthur Carstairs," said the priest positively,
"and he is a coin-collector of a somewhat singular kind."

     The man changed colour so horribly that the crooked nose
stood out on his face like a separate and comic thing.  He spoke,
nevertheless, with a sort of despairing dignity.  "You shall see,
then," he said, "that I have not lost all the family qualities."
And he turned suddenly and strode into an inner room, slamming the door.

     "Stop him!" shouted Father Brown, bounding and half falling
over a chair; and, after a wrench or two, Flambeau had the door open.
But it was too late.  In dead silence Flambeau strode across
and telephoned for doctor and police.

     An empty medicine bottle lay on the floor.  Across the table
the body of the man in the brown dressing-gown lay amid his burst
and gaping brown-paper parcels; out of which poured and rolled,
not Roman, but very modern English coins.

     The priest held up the bronze head of Caesar.  "This," he said,
"was all that was left of the Carstairs Collection."

     After a silence he went on, with more than common gentleness:
"It was a cruel will his wicked father made, and you see he did
resent it a little.  He hated the Roman money he had, and grew fonder
of the real money denied him.  He not only sold the Collection
bit by bit, but sank bit by bit to the basest ways of making money--
even to blackmailing his own family in a disguise.  He blackmailed
his brother from Australia for his little forgotten crime (that is why
he took the cab to Wagga Wagga in Putney), he blackmailed his sister
for the theft he alone could have noticed.  And that, by the way,
is why she had that supernatural guess when he was away on the sand-dunes.
Mere figure and gait, however distant, are more likely to remind us
of somebody than a well-made-up face quite close."

     There was another silence.  "Well," growled the detective,
"and so this great numismatist and coin-collector was nothing but
a vulgar miser."

     "Is there so great a difference?" asked Father Brown, in the same
strange, indulgent tone.  "What is there wrong about a miser that is
not often as wrong about a collector?  What is wrong, except...
thou shalt not make to thyself any graven image; thou shalt not
bow down to them nor serve them, for I...but we must go and see how
the poor young people are getting on."

     "I think," said Flambeau, "that in spite of everything,
they are probably getting on very well."




VII. The Purple Wig


MR EDWARD NUTT, the industrious editor of the Daily Reformer,
sat at his desk, opening letters and marking proofs to the merry tune
of a typewriter, worked by a vigorous young lady.

     He was a stoutish, fair man, in his shirt-sleeves; his movements
were resolute, his mouth firm and his tones final; but his round,
rather babyish blue eyes had a bewildered and even wistful look
that rather contradicted all this.  Nor indeed was the expression
altogether misleading.  It might truly be said of him, as for many
journalists in authority, that his most familiar emotion was one of
continuous fear; fear of libel actions, fear of lost advertisements,
fear of misprints, fear of the sack.

     His life was a series of distracted compromises between
the proprietor of the paper (and of him), who was a senile soap-boiler
with three ineradicable mistakes in his mind, and the very able staff
he had collected to run the paper; some of whom were brilliant
and experienced men and (what was even worse) sincere enthusiasts
for the political policy of the paper.

     A letter from one of these lay immediately before him,
and rapid and resolute as he was, he seemed almost to hesitate
before opening it.  He took up a strip of proof instead, ran down it
with a blue eye, and a blue pencil, altered the word "adultery"
to the word "impropriety," and the word "Jew" to the word "Alien,"
rang a bell and sent it flying upstairs.

     Then, with a more thoughtful eye, he ripped open the letter from his
more distinguished contributor, which bore a postmark of Devonshire,
and read as follows:

     DEAR NUTT,--As I see you're working Spooks and Dooks at the same time,
what about an article on that rum business of the Eyres of Exmoor;
or as the old women call it down here, the Devil's Ear of Eyre?
The head of the family, you know, is the Duke of Exmoor; he is one of
the few really stiff old Tory aristocrats left, a sound old crusted tyrant
it is quite in our line to make trouble about.  And I think I'm
on the track of a story that will make trouble.

     Of course I don't believe in the old legend about James I;
and as for you, you don't believe in anything, not even in journalism.
The legend, you'll probably remember, was about the blackest business
in English history--the poisoning of Overbury by that witch's cat
Frances Howard, and the quite mysterious terror which forced the King
to pardon the murderers.  There was a lot of alleged witchcraft
mixed up with it; and the story goes that a man-servant listening
at the keyhole heard the truth in a talk between the King and Carr;
and the bodily ear with which he heard grew large and monstrous
as by magic, so awful was the secret.  And though he had to be loaded
with lands and gold and made an ancestor of dukes, the elf-shaped ear
is still recurrent in the family.  Well, you don't believe in black magic;
and if you did, you couldn't use it for copy.  If a miracle happened
in your office, you'd have to hush it up, now so many bishops
are agnostics.  But that is not the point The point is that
there really is something queer about Exmoor and his family;
something quite natural, I dare say, but quite abnormal.
And the Ear is in it somehow, I fancy; either a symbol or a delusion
or disease or something.  Another tradition says that Cavaliers
just after James I began to wear their hair long only to cover
the ear of the first Lord Exmoor.  This also is no doubt fanciful.

     The reason I point it out to you is this:  It seems to me that
we make a mistake in attacking aristocracy entirely for its champagne
and diamonds.  Most men rather admire the nobs for having a good time,
but I think we surrender too much when we admit that aristocracy
has made even the aristocrats happy.  I suggest a series of articles
pointing out how dreary, how inhuman, how downright diabolist,
is the very smell and atmosphere of some of these great houses.
There are plenty of instances; but you couldn't begin with a better one
than the Ear of the Eyres.  By the end of the week I think I can
get you the truth about it.--Yours ever, FRANCIS FINN.

     Mr Nutt reflected a moment, staring at his left boot;
then he called out in a strong, loud and entirely lifeless voice,
in which every syllable sounded alike:  "Miss Barlow, take down
a letter to Mr Finn, please."

     DEAR FINN,--I think it would do; copy should reach us second post
Saturday.--Yours, E. NUTT.

     This elaborate epistle he articulated as if it were all one word;
and Miss Barlow rattled it down as if it were all one word.
Then he took up another strip of proof and a blue pencil,
and altered the word "supernatural" to the word "marvellous",
and the expression "shoot down" to the expression "repress".

     In such happy, healthful activities did Mr Nutt disport himself,
until the ensuing Saturday found him at the same desk, dictating to
the same typist, and using the same blue pencil on the first instalment
of Mr Finn's revelations.  The opening was a sound piece of slashing
invective about the evil secrets of princes, and despair in the high places
of the earth.  Though written violently, it was in excellent English;
but the editor, as usual, had given to somebody else the task
of breaking it up into sub-headings, which were of a spicier sort,
as "Peeress and Poisons", and "The Eerie Ear", "The Eyres in their Eyrie",
and so on through a hundred happy changes.  Then followed the legend
of the Ear, amplified from Finn's first letter, and then the substance
of his later discoveries, as follows:


     I know it is the practice of journalists to put the end of the story
at the beginning and call it a headline.  I know that journalism
largely consists in saying "Lord Jones Dead" to people who never knew
that Lord Jones was alive.  Your present correspondent thinks that this,
like many other journalistic customs, is bad journalism; and that
the Daily Reformer has to set a better example in such things.
He proposes to tell his story as it occurred, step by step.
He will use the real names of the parties, who in most cases are ready
to confirm his testimony.   As for the headlines, the sensational
proclamations--they will come at the end.

     I was walking along a public path that threads through
a private Devonshire orchard and seems to point towards Devonshire cider,
when I came suddenly upon just such a place as the path suggested.
It was a long, low inn, consisting really of a cottage and two barns;
thatched all over with the thatch that looks like brown and grey hair
grown before history.  But outside the door was a sign which
called it the Blue Dragon; and under the sign was one of those long
rustic tables that used to stand outside most of the free English inns,
before teetotallers and brewers between them destroyed freedom.
And at this table sat three gentlemen, who might have lived
a hundred years ago.

     Now that I know them all better, there is no difficulty
about disentangling the impressions; but just then they looked like
three very solid ghosts.  The dominant figure, both because he was
bigger in all three dimensions, and because he sat centrally
in the length of the table, facing me, was a tall, fat man dressed
completely in black, with a rubicund, even apoplectic visage,
but a rather bald and rather bothered brow.  Looking at him again,
more strictly, I could not exactly say what it was that gave me
the sense of antiquity, except the antique cut of his white
clerical necktie and the barred wrinkles across his brow.

     It was even less easy to fix the impression in the case of
the man at the right end of the table, who, to say truth,
was as commonplace a person as could be seen anywhere, with a round,
brown-haired head and a round snub nose, but also clad in clerical black,
of a stricter cut.  It was only when I saw his broad curved hat lying
on the table beside him that I realized why I connected him with
anything ancient.  He was a Roman Catholic priest.

     Perhaps the third man, at the other end of the table,
had really more to do with it than the rest, though he was both
slighter in physical presence and more inconsiderate in his dress.
His lank limbs were clad, I might also say clutched, in very tight
grey sleeves and pantaloons; he had a long, sallow, aquiline face
which seemed somehow all the more saturnine because his lantern jaws
were imprisoned in his collar and neck-cloth more in the style of
the old stock; and his hair (which ought to have been dark brown)
was of an odd dim, russet colour which, in conjunction with
his yellow face, looked rather purple than red.  The unobtrusive
yet unusual colour was all the more notable because his hair was
almost unnaturally healthy and curling, and he wore it full.
But, after all analysis, I incline to think that what gave me
my first old-fashioned impression was simply a set of tall,
old-fashioned wine-glasses, one or two lemons and two churchwarden pipes.
And also, perhaps, the old-world errand on which I had come.

     Being a hardened reporter, and it being apparently a public inn,
I did not need to summon much of my impudence to sit down at
the long table and order some cider.  The big man in black seemed
very learned, especially about local antiquities; the small man in black,
though he talked much less, surprised me with a yet wider culture.
So we got on very well together; but the third man, the old gentleman
in the tight pantaloons, seemed rather distant and haughty,
until I slid into the subject of the Duke of Exmoor and his ancestry.

     I thought the subject seemed to embarrass the other two a little;
but it broke the spell of the third man's silence most successfully.
Speaking with restraint and with the accent of a highly educated gentleman,
and puffing at intervals at his long churchwarden pipe, he proceeded
to tell me some of the most horrible stories I have ever heard in my life:
how one of the Eyres in the former ages had hanged his own father;
and another had his wife scourged at the cart tail through the village;
and another had set fire to a church full of children, and so on.

     Some of the tales, indeed, are not fit for public print--,
such as the story of the Scarlet Nuns, the abominable story of
the Spotted Dog, or the thing that was done in the quarry.
And all this red roll of impieties came from his thin, genteel lips
rather primly than otherwise, as he sat sipping the wine out of
his tall, thin glass.

     I could see that the big man opposite me was trying,
if anything, to stop him; but he evidently held the old gentleman
in considerable respect, and could not venture to do so at all abruptly.
And the little priest at the other end of the-table, though free from
any such air of embarrassment, looked steadily at the table,
and seemed to listen to the recital with great pain--as well as he might.

     "You don't seem," I said to the narrator, "to be very fond of
the Exmoor pedigree."

     He looked at me a moment, his lips still prim, but whitening
and tightening; then he deliberately broke his long pipe and glass
on the table and stood up, the very picture of a perfect gentleman
with the framing temper of a fiend.

     "These gentlemen," he said, "will tell you whether I have cause
to like it.  The curse of the Eyres of old has lain heavy on this country,
and many have suffered from it.  They know there are none who have
suffered from it as I have."  And with that he crushed a piece of
the fallen glass under his heel, and strode away among the green twilight
of the twinkling apple-trees.

     "That is an extraordinary old gentleman," I said to the other two;
"do you happen to know what the Exmoor family has done to him?  Who is he?"

     The big man in black was staring at me with the wild air of
a baffled bull; he did not at first seem to take it in.  Then he said
at last, "Don't you know who he is?"

     I reaffirmed my ignorance, and there was another silence;
then the little priest said, still looking at the table, "That is
the Duke of Exmoor."

     Then, before I could collect my scattered senses, he added
equally quietly, but with an air of regularizing things:
"My friend here is Doctor Mull, the Duke's librarian.  My name is Brown."

     "But," I stammered, "if that is the Duke, why does he damn all
the old dukes like that?"

     "He seems really to believe," answered the priest called Brown,
"that they have left a curse on him." Then he added, with some irrelevance,
"That's why he wears a wig."

     It was a few moments before his meaning dawned on me.
"You don't mean that fable about the fantastic ear?" I demanded.
"I've heard of it, of course, but surely it must be a superstitious yarn
spun out of something much simpler.  I've sometimes thought it was
a wild version of one of those mutilation stories.  They used to crop
criminals' ears in the sixteenth century."

     "I hardly think it was that," answered the little man thoughtfully,
"but it is not outside ordinary science or natural law for a family
to have some deformity frequently reappearing--such as one ear bigger
than the other."

     The big librarian had buried his big bald brow in his big red hands,
like a man trying to think out his duty.  "No," he groaned.
"You do the man a wrong after all.  Understand, I've no reason
to defend him, or even keep faith with him.  He has been a tyrant to me
as to everybody else.  Don't fancy because you see him sitting here
that he isn't a great lord in the worst sense of the word.
He would fetch a man a mile to ring a bell a yard off--if it would
summon another man three miles to fetch a matchbox three yards off.
He must have a footman to carry his walking-stick; a body servant
to hold up his opera-glasses--"

     "But not a valet to brush his clothes," cut in the priest,
with a curious dryness, "for the valet would want to brush his wig, too."

     The librarian turned to him and seemed to forget my presence;
he was strongly moved and, I think, a little heated with wine.
"I don't know how you know it, Father Brown," he said, "but you are right.
He lets the whole world do everything for him--except dress him.
And that he insists on doing in a literal solitude like a desert.
Anybody is kicked out of the house without a character who is
so much as found near his dressing-room door.,

     "He seems a pleasant old party," I remarked.

     "No," replied Dr Mull quite simply; "and yet that is just what
I mean by saying you are unjust to him after all.  Gentlemen, the Duke
does really feel the bitterness about the curse that he uttered just now.
He does, with sincere shame and terror, hide under that purple wig
something he thinks it would blast the sons of man to see.
I know it is so; and I know it is not a mere natural disfigurement,
like a criminal mutilation, or a hereditary disproportion in the features.
I know it is worse than that; because a man told me who was present
at a scene that no man could invent, where a stronger man than
any of us tried to defy the secret, and was scared away from it."

     I opened my mouth to speak, but Mull went on in oblivion of me,
speaking out of the cavern of his hands.  "I don't mind telling you,
Father, because it's really more defending the poor Duke than
giving him away.  Didn't you ever hear of the time when he
very nearly lost all the estates?"

     The priest shook his head; and the librarian proceeded to
tell the tale as he had heard it from his predecessor in the same post,
who had been his patron and instructor, and whom he seemed to trust
implicitly.  Up to a certain point it was a common enough tale
of the decline of a great family's fortunes--the tale of a family lawyer.
His lawyer, however, had the sense to cheat honestly, if the expression
explains itself.  Instead of using funds he held in trust,
he took advantage of the Duke's carelessness to put the family in
a financial hole, in which it might be necessary for the Duke to
let him hold them in reality.

     The lawyer's name was Isaac Green, but the Duke always called him
Elisha; presumably in reference to the fact that he was quite bald,
though certainly not more than thirty.  He had risen very rapidly,
but from very dirty beginnings; being first a "nark" or informer,
and then a money-lender:  but as solicitor to the Eyres he had the sense,
as I say, to keep technically straight until he was ready to deal
the final blow.  The blow fell at dinner; and the old librarian said
he should never forget the very look of the lampshades and the decanters,
as the little lawyer, with a steady smile, proposed to the great landlord
that they should halve the estates between them.  The sequel certainly
could not be overlooked; for the Duke, in dead silence, smashed
a decanter on the man's bald head as suddenly as I had seen him smash
the glass that day in the orchard.  It left a red triangular scar
on the scalp, and the lawyer's eyes altered, but not his smile.

     He rose tottering to his feet, and struck back as such men do strike.
"I am glad of that," he said, "for now I can take the whole estate.
The law will give it to me."

     Exmoor, it seems, was white as ashes, but his eyes still blazed.
"The law will give it you," he said; "but you will not take it....
Why not?  Why? because it would mean the crack of doom for me,
and if you take it I shall take off my wig....  Why, you pitiful
plucked fowl, anyone can see your bare head.  But no man shall
see mine and live."

     Well, you may say what you like and make it mean what you like.
But Mull swears it is the solemn fact that the lawyer, after shaking
his knotted fists in the air for an instant, simply ran from the room
and never reappeared in the countryside; and since then Exmoor has been
feared more for a warlock than even for a landlord and a magistrate.

     Now Dr Mull told his story with rather wild theatrical gestures,
and with a passion I think at least partisan.  I was quite conscious
of the possibility that the whole was the extravagance of
an old braggart and gossip.  But before I end this half of my discoveries,
I think it due to Dr Mull to record that my two first inquiries
have confirmed his story.  I learned from an old apothecary in the village
that there was a bald man in evening dress, giving the name of Green,
who came to him one night to have a three-cornered cut on his forehead
plastered.  And I learnt from the legal records and old newspapers
that there was a lawsuit threatened, and at least begun, by one Green
against the Duke of Exmoor.


     Mr Nutt, of the Daily Reformer, wrote some highly incongruous
words across the top of the copy, made some highly mysterious marks
down the side of it, and called to Miss Barlow in the same loud,
monotonous voice:  "Take down a letter to Mr Finn."

     DEAR FINN,--Your copy will do, but I have had to headline it a bit;
and our public would never stand a Romanist priest in the story--
you must keep your eye on the suburbs.  I've altered him to Mr Brown,
a Spiritualist.

                                             Yours,

                                                  E.  NUTT.


     A day or two afterward found the active and judicious editor
examining, with blue eyes that seemed to grow rounder and rounder,
the second instalment of Mr Finn's tale of mysteries in high life.
It began with the words:


     I have made an astounding discovery.  I freely confess it is
quite different from anything I expected to discover, and will give
a much more practical shock to the public.  I venture to say,
without any vanity, that the words I now write will be read all over Europe,
and certainly all over America and the Colonies.  And yet I heard
all I have to tell before I left this same little wooden table in this
same little wood of apple-trees.

     I owe it all to the small priest Brown; he is an extraordinary man.
The big librarian had left the table, perhaps ashamed of his long tongue,
perhaps anxious about the storm in which his mysterious master
had vanished:  anyway, he betook himself heavily in the Duke's tracks
through the trees.  Father Brown had picked up one of the lemons and
was eyeing it with an odd pleasure.

     "What a lovely colour a lemon is!" he said.  "There's one thing
I don't like about the Duke's wig--the colour."

     "I don't think I understand," I answered.

     "I dare say he's got good reason to cover his ears, like King Midas,"
went on the priest, with a cheerful simplicity which somehow seemed
rather flippant under the circumstances.  "I can quite understand
that it's nicer to cover them with hair than with brass plates or
leather flaps.  But if he wants to use hair, why doesn't he make it
look like hair?  There never was hair of that colour in this world.
It looks more like a sunset-cloud coming through the wood.
Why doesn't he conceal the family curse better, if he's really
so ashamed of it?  Shall I tell you?  It's because he isn't ashamed of it.
He's proud of it"

     "It's an ugly wig to be proud of--and an ugly story," I said.

     "Consider," replied this curious little man, "how you yourself
really feel about such things.  I don't suggest you're either
more snobbish or more morbid than the rest of us:  but don't you feel
in a vague way that a genuine old family curse is rather a fine thing
to have?  Would you be ashamed, wouldn't you be a little proud,
if the heir of the Glamis horror called you his friend? or if Byron's
family had confided, to you only, the evil adventures of their race?
Don't be too hard on the aristocrats themselves if their heads are
as weak as ours would be, and they are snobs about their own sorrows."

     "By Jove!" I cried; "and that's true enough.  My own mother's family
had a banshee; and, now I come to think of it, it has comforted me
in many a cold hour."

     "And think," he went on, "of that stream of blood and poison
that spurted from his thin lips the instant you so much as mentioned
his ancestors.  Why should he show every stranger over such
a Chamber of Horrors unless he is proud of it?  He doesn't conceal his wig,
he doesn't conceal his blood, he doesn't conceal his family curse,
he doesn't conceal the family crimes--but--"

     The little man's voice changed so suddenly, he shut his hand
so sharply, and his eyes so rapidly grew rounder and brighter
like a waking owl's, that it had all the abruptness of a small explosion
on the table.

     "But," he ended, "he does really conceal his toilet."

     It somehow completed the thrill of my fanciful nerves that
at that instant the Duke appeared again silently among the glimmering trees,
with his soft foot and sunset-hued hair, coming round the corner of
the house in company with his librarian.  Before he came within earshot,
Father Brown had added quite composedly, "Why does he really hide
the secret of what he does with the purple wig?  Because it isn't
the sort of secret we suppose."

     The Duke came round the corner and resumed his seat at the head
of the table with all his native dignity.  The embarrassment of
the librarian left him hovering on his hind legs, like a huge bear.
The Duke addressed the priest with great seriousness.  "Father Brown,"
he said, "Doctor Mull informs me that you have come here to make a request.
I no longer profess an observance of the religion of my fathers;
but for their sakes, and for the sake of the days when we met before,
I am very willing to hear you.  But I presume you would rather
be heard in private."

     Whatever I retain of the gentleman made me stand up.
Whatever I have attained of the journalist made me stand still.
Before this paralysis could pass, the priest had made a momentarily
detaining motion.  "If," he said, "your Grace will permit me
my real petition, or if I retain any right to advise you, I would urge
that as many people as possible should be present.  All over this country
I have found hundreds, even of my own faith and flock, whose imaginations
are poisoned by the spell which I implore you to break.  I wish we could
have all Devonshire here to see you do it."

     "To see me do what?" asked the Duke, arching his eyebrows.

     "To see you take off your wig," said Father Brown.

     The Duke's face did not move; but he looked at his petitioner
with a glassy stare which was the most awful expression I have ever seen
on a human face.  I could see the librarian's great legs wavering
under him like the shadows of stems in a pool; and I could not banish
from my own brain the fancy that the trees all around us were
filling softly in the silence with devils instead of birds.

     "I spare you," said the Duke in a voice of inhuman pity.
"I refuse.  If I gave you the faintest hint of the load of horror
I have to bear alone, you would lie shrieking at these feet of mine
and begging to know no more.  I will spare you the hint.
You shall not spell the first letter of what is written on
the altar of the Unknown God."

     "I know the Unknown God," said the little priest, with an
unconscious grandeur of certitude that stood up like a granite tower.
"I know his name; it is Satan.  The true God was made flesh
and dwelt among us.  And I say to you, wherever you find men ruled
merely by mystery, it is the mystery of iniquity.  If the devil
tells you something is too fearful to look at, look at it.
If he says something is too terrible to hear, hear it.  If you think
some truth unbearable, bear it.  I entreat your Grace to end
this nightmare now and here at this table."

     "If I did," said the Duke in a low voice, "you and all you believe,
and all by which alone you live, would be the first to shrivel and perish.
You would have an instant to know the great Nothing before you died."

     "The Cross of Christ be between me and harm," said Father Brown.
"Take off your wig."

     I was leaning over the table in ungovernable excitement;
in listening to this extraordinary duel half a thought had
come into my head.  "Your Grace," I cried, "I call your bluff.
Take off that wig or I will knock it off."

     I suppose I can be prosecuted for assault, but I am very glad
I did it.  When he said, in the same voice of stone, "I refuse,"
I simply sprang on him.  For three long instants he strained against me
as if he had all hell to help him; but I forced his head until
the hairy cap fell off it.  I admit that, whilst wrestling,
I shut my eyes as it fell.

     I was awakened by a cry from Mull, who was also by this time
at the Duke's side.  His head and mine were both bending over
the bald head of the wigless Duke.  Then the silence was snapped
by the librarian exclaiming:  "What can it mean?  Why, the man had
nothing to hide.  His ears are just like everybody else's."

     "Yes," said Father Brown, "that is what he had to hide."

     The priest walked straight up to him, but strangely enough
did not even glance at his ears.  He stared with an almost comical
seriousness at his bald forehead, and pointed to a three-cornered
cicatrice, long healed, but still discernible.  "Mr Green, I think."
he said politely, "and he did get the whole estate after all."

     And now let me tell the readers of the Daily Reformer
what I think the most remarkable thing in the whole affair.
This transformation scene, which will seem to you as wild and purple
as a Persian fairy-tale, has been (except for my technical assault)
strictly legal and constitutional from its first beginnings.
This man with the odd scar and the ordinary ears is not an impostor.
Though (in one sense) he wears another man's wig and claims
another man's ear, he has not stolen another man's coronet.
He really is the one and only Duke of Exmoor.  What happened was this.
The old Duke really had a slight malformation of the ear, which really
was more or less hereditary.  He really was morbid about it;
and it is likely enough that he did invoke it as a kind of curse
in the violent scene (which undoubtedly happened) in which he struck
Green with the decanter.  But the contest ended very differently.
Green pressed his claim and got the estates; the dispossessed nobleman
shot himself and died without issue.  After a decent interval
the beautiful English Government revived the "extinct" peerage of Exmoor,
and bestowed it, as is usual, on the most important person,
the person who had got the property.

     This man used the old feudal fables--properly, in his snobbish soul,
really envied and admired them.  So that thousands of poor English people
trembled before a mysterious chieftain with an ancient destiny and
a diadem of evil stars--when they are really trembling before
a guttersnipe who was a pettifogger and a pawnbroker not twelve years ago.
I think it very typical of the real case against our aristocracy as it is,
and as it will be till God sends us braver men.


     Mr Nutt put down the manuscript and called out with unusual
sharpness:  "Miss Barlow, please take down a letter to Mr Finn."

     DEAR FINN,--You must be mad; we can't touch this.  I wanted vampires
and the bad old days and aristocracy hand-in-hand with superstition.
They like that But you must know the Exmoors would never forgive this.
And what would our people say then, I should like to know!  Why, Sir Simon
is one of Exmoor's greatest pals; and it would ruin that cousin of
the Eyres that's standing for us at Bradford.  Besides, old Soap-Suds
was sick enough at not getting his peerage last year; he'd sack me by wire
if I lost him it with such lunacy as this.  And what about Duffey?
He's doing us some rattling articles on "The Heel of the Norman."
And how can he write about Normans if the man's only a solicitor?
Do be reasonable.--Yours, E. NUTT.

     As Miss Barlow rattled away cheerfully, he crumpled up the copy
and tossed it into the waste-paper basket; but not before he had,
automatically and by force of habit, altered the word "God"
to the word "circumstances."



VIII. The Perishing of the Pendragons


FATHER BROWN was in no mood for adventures.  He had lately fallen ill
with over-work, and when he began to recover, his friend Flambeau
had taken him on a cruise in a small yacht with Sir Cecil Fanshaw,
a young Cornish squire and an enthusiast for Cornish coast scenery.
But Brown was still rather weak; he was no very happy sailor;
and though he was never of the sort that either grumbles or breaks down,
his spirits did not rise above patience and civility.  When the other
two men praised the ragged violet sunset or the ragged volcanic crags,
he agreed with them.  When Flambeau pointed out a rock shaped
like a dragon, he looked at it and thought it very like a dragon.
When Fanshaw more excitedly indicated a rock that was like Merlin,
he looked at it, and signified assent.  When Flambeau asked whether
this rocky gate of the twisted river was not the gate of Fairyland,
he said "Yes."  He heard the most important things and the most trivial
with the same tasteless absorption.  He heard that the coast was death
to all but careful seamen; he also heard that the ship's cat was asleep.
He heard that Fanshaw couldn't find his cigar-holder anywhere;
he also heard the pilot deliver the oracle "Both eyes bright,
she's all right; one eye winks, down she sinks."  He heard Flambeau
say to Fanshaw that no doubt this meant the pilot must keep both eyes
open and be spry.  And he heard Fanshaw say to Flambeau that,
oddly enough, it didn't mean this:  it meant that while they
saw two of the coast lights, one near and the other distant,
exactly side by side, they were in the right river-channel;
but that if one light was hidden behind the other, they were going
on the rocks.  He heard Fanshaw add that his country was full of
such quaint fables and idioms; it was the very home of romance;
he even pitted this part of Cornwall against Devonshire, as a claimant
to the laurels of Elizabethan seamanship.  According to him
there had been captains among these coves and islets compared with whom
Drake was practically a landsman.  He heard Flambeau laugh, and ask if,
perhaps, the adventurous title of "Westward Ho!" only meant that
all Devonshire men wished they were living in Cornwall.  He heard Fanshaw
say there was no need to be silly; that not only had Cornish captains
been heroes, but that they were heroes still:  that near that very spot
there was an old admiral, now retired, who was scarred by thrilling voyages
full of adventures; and who had in his youth found the last group
of eight Pacific Islands that was added to the chart of the world.
This Cecil Fanshaw was, in person, of the kind that commonly urges
such crude but pleasing enthusiasms; a very young man, light-haired,
high-coloured, with an eager profile; with a boyish bravado of spirits,
but an almost girlish delicacy of tint and type.  The big shoulders,
black brows and black mousquetaire swagger of Flambeau
were a great contrast.

     All these trivialities Brown heard and saw; but heard them
as a tired man hears a tune in the railway wheels, or saw them
as a sick man sees the pattern of his wall-paper.  No one can calculate
the turns of mood in convalescence:  but Father Brown's depression
must have had a great deal to do with his mere unfamiliarity with the sea.
For as the river mouth narrowed like the neck of a bottle,
and the water grew calmer and the air warmer and more earthly,
he seemed to wake up and take notice like a baby.  They had reached
that phase just after sunset when air and water both look bright,
but earth and all its growing things look almost black by comparison.
About this particular  evening, however, there was something exceptional.
It was one of those rare atmospheres in which a smoked-glass slide
seems to have been slid away from between us and Nature; so that even
dark colours on that day look more gorgeous than bright colours
on cloudier days.  The trampled earth of the river-banks and
the peaty stain in the pools did not look drab but glowing umber,
and the dark woods astir in the breeze did not look, as usual, dim blue
with mere depth of distance, but more like wind-tumbled masses of some
vivid violet blossom.  This magic clearness and intensity in the colours
was further forced on Brown's slowly reviving senses by something
romantic and even secret in the very form of the landscape.

     The river was still well wide and deep enough for a pleasure boat
so small as theirs; but the curves of the country-side suggested
that it was closing in on either hand; the woods seemed to be making
broken and flying attempts at bridge-building--as if the boat
were passing from the romance of a valley to the romance of a hollow
and so to the supreme romance of a tunnel.  Beyond this mere
look of things there was little for Brown's freshening fancy to feed on;
he saw no human beings, except some gipsies trailing along the river bank,
with faggots and osiers cut in the forest; and one sight
no longer unconventional, but in such remote parts still uncommon:
a dark-haired lady, bare-headed, and paddling her own canoe.
If Father Brown ever attached any importance to either of these,
he certainly forgot them at the next turn of the river which
brought in sight a singular object.

     The water seemed to widen and split, being cloven by the dark wedge
of a fish-shaped and wooded islet.  With the rate at which they went,
the islet seemed to swim towards them like a ship; a ship with
a very high prow--or, to speak more strictly, a very high funnel.
For at the extreme point nearest them stood up an odd-looking building,
unlike anything they could remember or connect with any purpose.
It was not specially high, but it was too high for its breadth
to be called anything but a tower.  Yet it appeared to be built
entirely of wood, and that in a most unequal and eccentric way.
Some of the planks and beams were of good, seasoned oak; some of
such wood cut raw and recent; some again of white pinewood,
and a great deal more of the same sort of wood painted black with tar.
These black beams were set crooked or crisscross at all kinds of angles,
giving the whole a most patchy and puzzling appearance.
There were one or two windows, which appeared to be coloured and
leaded in an old-fashioned but more elaborate style.  The travellers
looked at it with that paradoxical feeling we have when something
reminds us of something, and yet we are certain it is something
very different.

     Father Brown, even when he was mystified, was clever in analysing
his own mystification.  And he found himself reflecting that
the oddity seemed to consist in a particular shape cut out in
an incongruous material; as if one saw a top-hat made of tin,
or a frock-coat cut out of tartan.  He was sure he had seen timbers
of different tints arranged like that somewhere, but never
in such architectural proportions.  The next moment a glimpse
through the dark trees told him all he wanted to know and he laughed.
Through a gap in the foliage there appeared for a moment one of those
old wooden houses, faced with black beams, which are still to be found
here and there in England, but which most of us see imitated
in some show called "Old London" or "Shakespeare's England'.
It was in view only long enough for the priest to see that,
however old-fashioned, it was a comfortable and well-kept country-house,
with flower-beds in front of it.  It had none of the piebald and crazy
look of the tower that seemed made out of its refuse.

     "What on earth's this?" said Flambeau, who was still staring
at the tower.

     Fanshaw's eyes were shining, and he spoke triumphantly.
"Aha! you've not seen a place quite like this before, I fancy;
that's why I've brought you here, my friend.  Now you shall see
whether I exaggerate about the mariners of Cornwall.  This place belongs
to Old Pendragon, whom we call the Admiral; though he retired
before getting the rank.  The spirit of Raleigh and Hawkins is a memory
with the Devon folk; it's a modern fact with the Pendragons.
If Queen Elizabeth were to rise from the grave and come up this river
in a gilded barge, she would be received by the Admiral in a house
exactly such as she was accustomed to, in every corner and casement,
in every panel on the wall or plate on the table.  And she would find
an English Captain still talking fiercely of fresh lands to be found
in little ships, as much as if she had dined with Drake."

     "She'd find a rum sort of thing in the garden," said Father Brown,
"which would not please her Renaissance eye.  That Elizabethan domestic
architecture is charming in its way; but it's against the very nature
of it to break out into turrets."

     "And yet," answered Fanshaw, "that's the most romantic and
Elizabethan part of the business.  It was built by the Pendragons
in the very days of the Spanish wars; and though it's needed patching
and even rebuilding for another reason, it's always been rebuilt
in the old way.  The story goes that the lady of Sir Peter Pendragon
built it in this place and to this height, because from the top
you can just see the corner where vessels turn into the river mouth;
and she wished to be the first to see her husband's ship,
as he sailed home from the Spanish Main."

     "For what other reason," asked Father Brown, "do you mean that
it has been rebuilt?"

     "Oh, there's a strange story about that, too," said the young squire
with relish.  "You are really in a land of strange stories.
King Arthur was here and Merlin and the fairies before him.
The story goes that Sir Peter Pendragon, who (I fear) had some of
the faults of the pirates as well as the virtues of the sailor,
was bringing home three Spanish gentlemen in honourable captivity,
intending to escort them to Elizabeth's court.  But he was a man
of flaming and tigerish temper, and coming to high words with one of them,
he caught him by the throat and flung him by accident or design,
into the sea.  A second Spaniard, who was the brother of the first,
instantly drew his sword and flew at Pendragon, and after a short but
furious combat in which both got three wounds in as many minutes,
Pendragon drove his blade through the other's body and the second Spaniard
was accounted for.  As it happened the ship had already turned
into the river mouth and was close to comparatively shallow water.
The third Spaniard sprang over the side of the ship, struck out
for the shore, and was soon near enough to it to stand up to his waist
in water.  And turning again to face the ship, and holding up both
arms to Heaven--like a prophet calling plagues upon a wicked city--
he called out to Pendragon in a piercing and terrible voice,
that he at least was yet living, that he would go on living,
that he would live for ever; and that generation after generation
the house of Pendragon should never see him or his, but should know
by very certain signs that he and his vengeance were alive.
With that he dived under the wave, and was either drowned or swam
so long under water that no hair of his head was seen afterwards."

     "There's that girl in the canoe again," said Flambeau irrelevantly,
for good-looking young women would call him off any topic.
"She seems bothered by the queer tower just as we were."

     Indeed, the black-haired young lady was letting her canoe float
slowly and silently past the strange islet; and was looking intently up
at the strange tower, with a strong glow of curiosity on her oval
and olive face.

     "Never mind girls," said Fanshaw impatiently, "there are plenty
of them in the world, but not many things like the Pendragon Tower.
As you may easily suppose, plenty of superstitions and scandals
have followed in the track of the Spaniard's curse; and no doubt,
as you would put it, any accident happening to this Cornish family
would be connected with it by rural credulity.  But it is perfectly true
that this tower has been burnt down two or three times; and the family
can't be called lucky, for more than two, I think, of the Admiral's
near kin have perished by shipwreck; and one at least, to my own knowledge,
on practically the same spot where Sir Peter threw the Spaniard overboard."

     "What a pity!" exclaimed Flambeau.  "She's going."

     "When did your friend the Admiral tell you this family history?"
asked Father Brown, as the girl in the canoe paddled off,
without showing the least intention of extending her interest from
the tower to the yacht, which Fanshaw had already caused to lie
alongside the island.

     "Many years ago," replied Fanshaw; "he hasn't been to sea for
some time now, though he is as keen on it as ever.  I believe there's
a family compact or something.  Well, here's the landing stage;
let's come ashore and see the old boy."

     They followed him on to the island, just under the tower,
and Father Brown, whether from the mere touch of dry land, or the interest
of something on the other bank of the river (which he stared at
very hard for some seconds), seemed singularly improved in briskness.
They entered a wooded avenue between two fences of thin greyish wood,
such as often enclose parks or gardens, and over the top of which
the dark trees tossed to and fro like black and purple plumes upon
the hearse of a giant.  The tower, as they left it behind,
looked all the quainter, because such entrances are usually flanked
by two towers; and this one looked lopsided.  But for this, the avenue
had the usual appearance of the entrance to a gentleman's grounds;
and, being so curved that the house was now out of sight,
somehow looked a much larger park than any plantation on such an island
could really be.  Father Brown was, perhaps, a little fanciful
in his fatigue, but he almost thought the whole place must be
growing larger, as things do in a nightmare.  Anyhow, a mystical monotony
was the only character of their march, until Fanshaw suddenly stopped,
and pointed to something sticking out through the grey fence--
something that looked at first rather like the imprisoned horn
of some beast.  Closer observation showed that it was
a slightly curved blade of metal that shone faintly in the fading light.

     Flambeau, who like all Frenchmen had been a soldier, bent over it
and said in a startled voice:  "Why, it's a sabre!  I believe
I know the sort, heavy and curved, but shorter than the cavalry;
they used to have them in artillery and the--"

     As he spoke the blade plucked itself out of the crack it had made
and came down again with a more ponderous slash, splitting
the fissiparous fence to the bottom with a rending noise.
Then it was pulled out again, flashed above the fence some feet
further along, and again split it halfway down with the first stroke;
and after waggling a little to extricate itself (accompanied with
curses in the darkness) split it down to the ground with a second.
Then a kick of devilish energy sent the whole loosened square
of thin wood flying into the pathway, and a great gap of dark coppice
gaped in the paling.

     Fanshaw peered into the dark opening and uttered an exclamation
of astonishment.  "My dear Admiral!" he exclaimed, "do you--er--
do you generally cut out a new front door whenever you want to
go for a walk?"

     The voice in the gloom swore again, and then broke into a jolly laugh.
"No," it said; "I've really got to cut down this fence somehow;
it's spoiling all the plants, and no one else here can do it.
But I'll only carve another bit off the front door, and then come out
and welcome you."

     And sure enough, he heaved up his weapon once more, and,
hacking twice, brought down another and similar strip of fence,
making the opening about fourteen feet wide in all.  Then through this
larger forest gateway he came out into the evening light,
with a chip of grey wood sticking to his sword-blade.

     He momentarily fulfilled all Fanshaw's fable of an old piratical
Admiral; though the details seemed afterwards to decompose into accidents.
For instance, he wore a broad-brimmed hat as protection against the sun;
but the front flap of it was turned up straight to the sky, and the
two corners pulled down lower than the ears, so that it stood across
his forehead in a crescent like the old cocked hat worn by Nelson.
He wore an ordinary dark-blue jacket, with nothing special about
the buttons, but the combination of it with white linen trousers
somehow had a sailorish look.  He was tall and loose, and walked with
a sort of swagger, which was not a sailor's roll, and yet somehow
suggested it; and he held in his hand a short sabre which was like
a navy cutlass, but about twice as big.  Under the bridge of the hat
his eagle face looked eager, all the more because it was not only
clean-shaven, but without eyebrows.  It seemed almost as if all
the hair had come off his face from his thrusting it through
a throng of elements.  His eyes were prominent and piercing.
His colour was curiously attractive, while partly tropical;
it reminded one vaguely of a blood-orange.  That is, that while it was
ruddy and sanguine, there was a yellow in it that was in no way sickly,
but seemed rather to glow like gold apples of the Hesperides--
Father Brown thought he had never seen a figure so expressive
of all the romances about the countries of the Sun.

     When Fanshaw had presented his two friends to their host
he fell again into a tone of rallying the latter about his wreckage
of the fence and his apparent rage of profanity.  The Admiral pooh-poohed
it at first as a piece of necessary but annoying garden work;
but at length the ring of real energy came back into his laughter,
and he cried with a mixture of impatience and good humour:

     "Well, perhaps I do go at it a bit rabidly, and feel
a kind of pleasure in smashing anything.  So would you if your
only pleasure was in cruising about to find some new Cannibal Islands,
and you had to stick on this muddy little rockery in a sort of rustic pond.
When I remember how I've cut down a mile and a half of green poisonous
jungle with an old cutlass half as sharp as this; and then remember
I must stop here and chop this matchwood, because of some confounded
old bargain scribbled in a family Bible, why, I--"

     He swung up the heavy steel again; and this time sundered
the wall of wood from top to bottom at one stroke.

     "I feel like that," he said laughing, but furiously flinging
the sword some yards down the path, "and now let's go up to the house;
you must have some dinner."

     The semicircle of lawn in front of the house was varied by
three circular garden beds, one of red tulips, a second of
yellow tulips, and the third of some white, waxen-looking blossoms
that the visitors did not know and presumed to be exotic.
A heavy, hairy and rather sullen-looking gardener was hanging up
a heavy coil of garden hose.  The corners of the expiring sunset
which seemed to cling about the corners of the house gave glimpses
here and there of the colours of remoter flowerbeds; and in
a treeless space on one side of the house opening upon the river
stood a tall brass tripod on which was tilted a big brass telescope.
Just outside the steps of the porch stood a little painted
green garden table, as if someone had just had tea there.
The entrance was flanked with two of those half-featured lumps of stone
with holes for eyes that are said to be South Sea idols; and on
the brown oak beam across the doorway were some confused carvings
that looked almost as barbaric.

     As they passed indoors, the little cleric hopped suddenly
on to the table, and standing on it peered unaffectedly
through his spectacles at the mouldings in the oak.  Admiral Pendragon
looked very much astonished, though not particularly annoyed;
while Fanshaw was so amused with what looked like a performing pigmy
on his little stand, that he could not control his laughter.
But Father Brown was not likely to notice either the laughter
or the astonishment.

     He was gazing at three carved symbols, which, though very worn
and obscure, seemed still to convey some sense to him.  The first
seemed to be the outline of some tower or other building, crowned with
what looked like curly-pointed ribbons.  The second was clearer:
an old Elizabethan galley with decorative waves beneath it,
but interrupted in the middle by a curious jagged rock, which was either
a fault in the wood or some conventional representation of the water
coming in.  The third represented the upper half of a human figure,
ending in an escalloped line like the waves; the face was rubbed
and featureless, and both arms were held very stiffly up in the air.

     "Well," muttered Father Brown, blinking, "here is the legend
of the Spaniard plain enough.  Here he is holding up his arms
and cursing in the sea; and here are the two curses:  the wrecked ship
and the burning of Pendragon Tower."

     Pendragon shook his head with a kind of venerable amusement.
"And how many other things might it not be?" he said.  "Don't you know
that that sort of half-man, like a half-lion or half-stag,
is quite common in heraldry?  Might not that line through the ship
be one of those parti-per-pale lines, indented, I think they call it?
And though the third thing isn't so very heraldic, it would be
more heraldic to suppose it a tower crowned with laurel than with fire;
and it looks just as like it."

     "But it seems rather odd," said Flambeau, "that it should
exactly confirm the old legend."

     "Ah," replied the sceptical traveller, "but you don't know
how much of the old legend may have been made up from the old figures.
Besides, it isn't the only old legend.  Fanshaw, here, who is
fond of such things, will tell you there are other versions of the tale,
and much more horrible ones.  One story credits my unfortunate ancestor
with having had the Spaniard cut in two; and that will fit
the pretty picture also.  Another obligingly credits our family
with the possession of a tower full of snakes and explains those little,
wriggly things in that way.  And a third theory supposes the crooked line
on the ship to be a conventionalized thunderbolt; but that alone,
if seriously examined, would show what a very little way these
unhappy coincidences really go."

     "Why, how do you mean?" asked Fanshaw.

     "It so happens," replied his host coolly, "that there was
no thunder and lightning at all in the two or three shipwrecks
I know of in our family."

     "Oh!" said Father Brown, and jumped down from the little table.

     There was another silence in which they heard the continuous murmur
of the river; then Fanshaw said, in a doubtful and perhaps
disappointed tone:  "Then you don't think there is anything in the
tales of the tower in flames?"

     "There are the tales, of course," said the Admiral,
shrugging his shoulders; "and some of them, I don't deny,
on evidence as decent as one ever gets for such things.
Someone saw a blaze hereabout, don't you know, as he walked home
through a wood; someone keeping sheep on the uplands inland thought
he saw a flame hovering over Pendragon Tower.  Well, a damp dab of mud
like this confounded island seems the last place where one would
think of fires."

     "What is that fire over there?" asked Father Brown with
a gentle suddenness, pointing to the woods on the left river-bank.
They were all thrown a little off their balance, and the more fanciful
Fanshaw had even some difficulty in recovering his, as they saw a long,
thin stream of blue smoke ascending silently into the end of
the evening light.

     Then Pendragon broke into a scornful laugh again.  "Gipsies!"
he said; "they've been camping about here for about a week.
Gentlemen, you want your dinner," and he turned as if to enter the house.

     But the antiquarian superstition in Fanshaw was still quivering,
and he said hastily:  "But, Admiral, what's that hissing noise
quite near the island?  It's very like fire."

     "It's more like what it is," said the Admiral, laughing as he
led the way; "it's only some canoe going by."

     Almost as he spoke, the butler, a lean man in black,
with very black hair and a very long, yellow face, appeared in the doorway
and told him that dinner was served.

     The dining-room was as nautical as the cabin of a ship;
but its note was rather that of the modern than the Elizabethan captain.
There were, indeed, three antiquated cutlasses in a trophy over
the fireplace, and one brown sixteenth-century map with Tritons
and little ships dotted about a curly sea.  But such things were
less prominent on the white panelling than some cases of quaint-coloured
South American birds, very scientifically stuffed, fantastic shells
from the Pacific, and several instruments so rude and queer in shape
that savages might have used them either to kill their enemies or
to cook them.  But the alien colour culminated in the fact that,
besides the butler, the Admiral's only servants were two negroes,
somewhat quaintly clad in tight uniforms of yellow.  The priest's
instinctive trick of analysing his own impressions told him that
the colour and the little neat coat-tails of these bipeds had suggested
the word "Canary," and so by a mere pun connected them with
southward travel.  Towards the end of the dinner they took their
yellow clothes and black faces out of the room, leaving only
the black clothes and yellow face of the butler.

     "I'm rather sorry you take this so lightly," said Fanshaw to the host;
"for the truth is, I've brought these friends of mine with the idea
of their helping you, as they know a good deal of these things.
Don't you really believe in the family story at all?"

     "I don't believe in anything," answered Pendragon very briskly,
with a bright eye cocked at a red tropical bird.  "I'm a man of science."

     Rather to Flambeau's surprise, his clerical friend,
who seemed to have entirely woken up, took up the digression and
talked natural history with his host with a flow of words and
much unexpected information, until the dessert and decanters were
set down and the last of the servants vanished.  Then he said,
without altering his tone.

     "Please don't think me impertinent, Admiral Pendragon.  I don't
ask for curiosity, but really for my guidance and your convenience.
Have I made a bad shot if I guess you don't want these old things
talked of before your butler?"

     The Admiral lifted the hairless arches over his eyes and exclaimed:
"Well, I don't know where you got it, but the truth is I can't stand
the fellow, though I've no excuse for discharging a family servant.
Fanshaw, with his fairy tales, would say my blood moved against men
with that black, Spanish-looking hair."

     Flambeau struck the table with his heavy fist.  "By Jove!" he cried;
"and so had that girl!"

     "I hope it'll all end tonight," continued the Admiral,
"when my nephew comes back safe from his ship.  You looked surprised.
You won't understand, I suppose, unless I tell you the story.
You see, my father had two sons; I remained a bachelor,
but my elder brother married, and had a son who became a sailor
like all the rest of us, and will inherit the proper estate.
Well, my father was a strange man; he somehow combined Fanshaw's
superstition with a good deal of my scepticism--they were always
fighting in him; and after my first voyages, he developed a notion
which he thought somehow would settle finally whether the curse
was truth or trash.  If all the Pendragons sailed about anyhow,
he thought there would be too much chance of natural catastrophes
to prove anything.  But if we went to sea one at a time in strict order
of succession to the property, he thought it might show whether any
connected fate followed the family as a family.  It was a silly notion,
I think, and I quarrelled with my father pretty heartily; for I was
an ambitious man and was left to the last, coming, by succession,
after my own nephew."

     "And your father and brother," said the priest, very gently,
"died at sea, I fear."

     "Yes," groaned the Admiral; "by one of those brutal accidents
on which are built all the lying mythologies of mankind,
they were both shipwrecked.  My father, coming up this coast
out of the Atlantic, was washed up on these Cornish rocks.
My brother's ship was sunk, no one knows where, on the voyage home
from Tasmania.  His body was never found.  I tell you it was
from perfectly natural mishap; lots of other people besides Pendragons
were drowned; and both disasters are discussed in a normal way
by navigators.  But, of course, it set this forest of superstition on fire;
and men saw the flaming tower everywhere.  That's why I say it will
be all right when Walter returns.  The girl he's engaged to was
coming today; but I was so afraid of some chance delay frightening her
that I wired her not to come till she heard from me.  But he's practically
sure to be here some time tonight, and then it'll all end in smoke--
tobacco smoke.  We'll crack that old lie when we crack a bottle
of this wine."

     "Very good wine," said Father Brown, gravely lifting his glass,
"but, as you see, a very bad wine-bibber.  I most sincerely
beg your pardon":  for he had spilt a small spot of wine on
the table-cloth.  He drank and put down the glass with a composed face;
but his hand had started at the exact moment when he became conscious
of a face looking in through the garden window just behind the Admiral--
the face of a woman, swarthy, with southern hair and eyes, and young,
but like a mask of tragedy.

     After a pause the priest spoke again in his mild manner.
"Admiral," he said, "will you do me a favour?  Let me, and my friends
if they like, stop in that tower of yours just for tonight?
Do you know that in my business you're an exorcist almost before
anything else?"

     Pendragon sprang to his feet and paced swiftly to and fro
across the window, from which the face had instantly vanished.
"I tell you there is nothing in it," he cried, with ringing violence.
"There is one thing I know about this matter.  You may call me an atheist.
I am an atheist."  Here he swung round and fixed Father Brown with a face
of frightful concentration.  "This business is perfectly natural.
There is no curse in it at all."

     Father Brown smiled.  "In that case," he said, "there can't be
any objection to my sleeping in your delightful summer-house."

     "The idea is utterly ridiculous," replied the Admiral,
beating a tattoo on the back of his chair.

     "Please forgive me for everything," said Brown in his most
sympathetic tone, "including spilling the wine.  But it seems to me
you are not quite so easy about the flaming tower as you try to be."

     Admiral Pendragon sat down again as abruptly as he had risen;
but he sat quite still, and when he spoke again it was in a lower voice.
"You do it at your own peril," he said; "but wouldn't you be an atheist
to keep sane in all this devilry?"

     Some three hours afterwards Fanshaw, Flambeau and the priest
were still dawdling about the garden in the dark; and it began to dawn
on the other two that Father Brown had no intention of going to bed
either in the tower or the house.

     "I think the lawn wants weeding," said he dreamily.
"If I could find a spud or something I'd do it myself."

     They followed him, laughing and half remonstrating; but he replied
with the utmost solemnity, explaining to them, in a maddening little sermon,
that one can always find some small occupation that is helpful to others.
He did not find a spud; but he found an old broom made of twigs,
with which he began energetically to brush the fallen leaves off the grass.

     "Always some little thing to be done," he said with
idiotic cheerfulness; "as George Herbert says:  `Who sweeps
an Admiral's garden in Cornwall as for Thy laws makes that and
the action fine.' And now," he added, suddenly slinging the broom away,
"Let's go and water the flowers."

     With the same mixed emotions they watched him uncoil some
considerable lengths of the large garden hose, saying with an air of
wistful discrimination:  "The red tulips before the yellow, I think.
Look a bit dry, don't you think?"

     He turned the little tap on the instrument, and the water shot out
straight and solid as a long rod of steel.

     "Look out, Samson," cried Flambeau; "why, you've cut off
the tulip's head."

     Father Brown stood ruefully contemplating the decapitated plant.

     "Mine does seem to be a rather kill or cure sort of watering,"
he admitted, scratching his head.  "I suppose it's a pity I didn't
find the spud.  You should have seen me with the spud!  Talking of tools,
you've got that swordstick, Flambeau, you always carry?  That's right;
and Sir Cecil could have that sword the Admiral threw away
by the fence here.  How grey everything looks!"

     "The mist's rising from the river," said the staring Flambeau.

     Almost as he spoke the huge figure of the hairy gardener appeared
on a higher ridge of the trenched and terraced lawn, hailing them with
a brandished rake and a horribly bellowing voice.  "Put down that hose,"
he shouted; "put down that hose and go to your--"

     "I am fearfully clumsy," replied the reverend gentleman weakly;
"do you know, I upset some wine at dinner." He made a wavering
half-turn of apology towards the gardener, with the hose still spouting
in his hand.  The gardener caught the cold crash of the water
full in his face like the crash of a cannon-ball; staggered,
slipped and went sprawling with his boots in the air.

     "How very dreadful!" said Father Brown, looking round in
a sort of wonder.  "Why, I've hit a man!"

     He stood with his head forward for a moment as if
looking or listening; and then set off at a trot towards the tower,
still trailing the hose behind him.  The tower was quite close,
but its outline was curiously dim.

     "Your river mist," he said, "has a rum smell."

     "By the Lord it has," cried Fanshaw, who was very white.
"But you can't mean--"

     "I mean," said Father Brown, "that one of the Admiral's scientific
predictions is coming true tonight.  This story is going to end in smoke."

     As he spoke a most beautiful rose-red light seemed to burst
into blossom like a gigantic rose; but accompanied with a crackling
and rattling noise that was like the laughter of devils.

     "My God! what is this?" cried Sir Cecil Fanshaw.

     "The sign of the flaming tower," said Father Brown, and sent
the driving water from his hose into the heart of the red patch.

     "Lucky we hadn't gone to bed!" ejaculated Fanshaw.  "I suppose
it can't spread to the house."

     "You may remember," said the priest quietly, "that the wooden fence
that might have carried it was cut away."

     Flambeau turned electrified eyes upon his friend, but Fanshaw
only said rather absently:  "Well, nobody can be killed, anyhow."

     "This is rather a curious kind of tower," observed Father Brown,
"when it takes to killing people, it always kills people
who are somewhere else."

     At the same instant the monstrous figure of the gardener with
the streaming beard stood again on the green ridge against the sky,
waving others to come on; but now waving not a rake but a cutlass.
Behind him came the two negroes, also with the old crooked cutlasses
out of the trophy.  But in the blood-red glare, with their black faces
and yellow figures, they looked like devils carrying instruments of torture.
In the dim garden behind them a distant voice was heard calling out
brief directions.  When the priest heard the voice, a terrible change
came over his countenance.

     But he remained composed; and never took his eye off
the patch of flame which had begun by spreading, but now seemed
to shrink a little as it hissed under the torch of the long silver spear
of water.  He kept his finger along the nozzle of the pipe to ensure the aim,
and attended to no other business, knowing only by the noise and
that semi-conscious corner of the eye, the exciting incidents that
began to tumble themselves about the island garden.  He gave two brief
directions to his friends.  One was:  "Knock these fellows down somehow
and tie them up, whoever they are; there's rope down by those faggots.
They want to take away my nice hose." The other was:  "As soon as you
get a chance, call out to that canoeing girl; she's over on the bank
with the gipsies.  Ask her if they could get some buckets across
and fill them from the river."  Then he closed his mouth and continued
to water the new red flower as ruthlessly as he had watered the red tulip.

     He never turned his head to look at the strange fight that
followed between the foes and friends of the mysterious fire.
He almost felt the island shake when Flambeau collided with
the huge gardener; he merely imagined how it would whirl round them
as they wrestled.  He heard the crashing fall; and his friend's
gasp of triumph as he dashed on to the first negro; and the cries
of both the blacks as Flambeau and Fanshaw bound them.
Flambeau's enormous strength more than redressed the odds in the fight,
especially as the fourth man still hovered near the house,
only a shadow and a voice.  He heard also the water broken by
the paddles of a canoe; the girl's voice giving orders,
the voices of gipsies answering and coming nearer, the plumping and
sucking noise of empty buckets plunged into a full stream; and finally
the sound of many feet around the fire.  But all this was less to him
than the fact that the red rent, which had lately once more increased,
had once more slightly diminished.

     Then came a cry that very nearly made him turn his head.
Flambeau and Fanshaw, now reinforced by some of the gipsies,
had rushed after the mysterious man by the house; and he heard from
the other end of the garden the Frenchman's cry of horror and astonishment.
It was echoed by a howl not to be called human, as the being broke
from their hold and ran along the garden.  Three times at least
it raced round the whole island, in a way that was as horrible as
the chase of a lunatic, both in the cries of the pursued and the ropes
carried by the pursuers; but was more horrible still, because it somehow
suggested one of the chasing games of children in a garden.
Then, finding them closing in on every side, the figure sprang upon
one of the higher river banks and disappeared with a splash
into the dark and driving river.

     "You can do no more, I fear," said Brown in a voice cold with pain.
"He has been washed down to the rocks by now, where he has sent
so many others.  He knew the use of a family legend."

     "Oh, don't talk in these parables," cried Flambeau impatiently.
"Can't you put it simply in words of one syllable?"

     "Yes," answered Brown, with his eye on the hose.  "`Both eyes bright,
she's all right; one eye blinks, down she sinks.'"

     The fire hissed and shrieked more and more, like a strangled thing,
as it grew narrower and narrower under the flood from the pipe and buckets,
but Father Brown still kept his eye on it as he went on speaking:

     "I thought of asking this young lady, if it were morning yet,
to look through that telescope at the river mouth and the river.
She might have seen something to interest her:  the sign of the ship,
or Mr Walter Pendragon coming home, and perhaps even the sign of
the half-man, for though he is certainly safe by now, he may very well
have waded ashore.  He has been within a shave of another shipwreck;
and would never have escaped it, if the lady hadn't had the sense
to suspect the old Admiral's telegram and come down to watch him.
Don't let's talk about the old Admiral.  Don't let's talk about anything.
It's enough to say that whenever this tower, with its pitch and resin-wood,
really caught fire, the spark on the horizon always looked like
the twin light to the coast light-house."

     "And that," said Flambeau, "is how the father and brother died.
The wicked uncle of the legends very nearly got his estate after all."

     Father Brown did not answer; indeed, he did not speak again,
save for civilities, till they were all safe round a cigar-box in
the cabin of the yacht.  He saw that the frustrated fire was extinguished;
and then refused to linger, though he actually heard young Pendragon,
escorted by an enthusiastic crowd, come tramping up the river bank;
and might (had he been moved by romantic curiosities) have received
the combined thanks of the man from the ship and the girl from the canoe.
But his fatigue had fallen on him once more, and he only started once,
when Flambeau abruptly told him he had dropped cigar-ash on his trousers.

     "That's no cigar-ash," he said rather wearily.  "That's from the fire,
but you don't think so because you're all smoking cigars.
That's just the way I got my first faint suspicion about the chart."

     "Do you mean Pendragon's chart of his Pacific Islands?" asked Fanshaw.

     "You thought it was a chart of the Pacific Islands," answered Brown.
"Put a feather with a fossil and a bit of coral and everyone will
think it's a specimen.  Put the same feather with a ribbon and
an artificial flower and everyone will think it's for a lady's hat.
Put the same feather with an ink-bottle, a book and a stack
of writing-paper, and most men will swear they've seen a quill pen.
So you saw that map among tropic birds and shells and thought it was
a map of Pacific Islands.  It was the map of this river."

     "But how do you know?" asked Fanshaw.

     "I saw the rock you thought was like a dragon, and the one
like Merlin, and--"

     "You seem to have noticed a lot as we came in," cried Fanshaw.
"We thought you were rather abstracted."

     "I was sea-sick," said Father Brown simply.  "I felt simply horrible.
But feeling horrible has nothing to do with not seeing things."
And he closed his eyes.

     "Do you think most men would have seen that?" asked Flambeau.
He received no answer:  Father Brown was asleep.




IX. The God of the Gongs


IT was one of those chilly and empty afternoons in early winter,
when the daylight is silver rather than gold and pewter rather than silver.
If it was dreary in a hundred bleak offices and yawning drawing-rooms,
it was drearier still along the edges of the flat Essex coast,
where the monotony was the more inhuman for being broken
at very long intervals by a lamp-post that looked less civilized
than a tree, or a tree that looked more ugly than a lamp-post.
A light fall of snow had half-melted into a few strips, also looking leaden
rather than silver, when it had been fixed again by the seal of frost;
no fresh snow had fallen, but a ribbon of the old snow ran along
the very margin of the coast, so as to parallel the pale ribbon of the foam.

     The line of the sea looked frozen in the very vividness of
its violet-blue, like the vein of a frozen finger.  For miles and miles,
forward and back, there was no breathing soul, save two pedestrians,
walking at a brisk pace, though one had much longer legs and took
much longer strides than the other.

     It did not seem a very appropriate place or time for a holiday,
but Father Brown had few holidays, and had to take them when he could,
and he always preferred, if possible, to take them in company with
his old friend Flambeau, ex-criminal and ex-detective.  The priest had
had a fancy for visiting his old parish at Cobhole, and was going
north-eastward along the coast.

     After walking a mile or two farther, they found that the shore was
beginning to be formally embanked, so as to form something like a parade;
the ugly lamp-posts became less few and far between and more ornamental,
though quite equally ugly.  Half a mile farther on Father Brown
was puzzled first by little labyrinths of flowerless flower-pots,
covered with the low, flat, quiet-coloured plants that look less like
a garden than a tessellated pavement, between weak curly paths studded
with seats with curly backs.  He faintly sniffed the atmosphere of
a certain sort of seaside town that be did not specially care about,
and, looking ahead along the parade by the sea, he saw something that
put the matter beyond a doubt.  In the grey distance the big bandstand
of a watering-place stood up like a giant mushroom with six legs.

     "I suppose," said Father Brown, turning up his coat-collar
and drawing a woollen scarf rather closer round his neck,
"that we are approaching a pleasure resort."

     "I fear," answered Flambeau, "a pleasure resort to which
few people just now have the pleasure of resorting.  They try to
revive these places in the winter, but it never succeeds except with
Brighton and the old ones.  This must be Seawood, I think--
Lord Pooley's experiment; he had the Sicilian Singers down at Christmas,
and there's talk about holding one of the great glove-fights here.
But they'll have to chuck the rotten place into the sea;
it's as dreary as a lost railway-carriage."

     They had come under the big bandstand, and the priest was
looking up at it with a curiosity that had something rather odd about it,
his head a little on one side, like a bird's.  It was the conventional,
rather tawdry kind of erection for its purpose:  a flattened dome
or canopy, gilt here and there, and lifted on six slender pillars
of painted wood, the whole being raised about five feet above the parade
on a round wooden platform like a drum.  But there was something
fantastic about the snow combined with something artificial about
the gold that haunted Flambeau as well as his friend with
some association he could not capture, but which he knew was at once
artistic and alien.

     "I've got it," he said at last.  "It's Japanese.  It's like
those fanciful Japanese prints, where the snow on the mountain
looks like sugar, and the gilt on the pagodas is like gilt on gingerbread.
It looks just like a little pagan temple."

     "Yes," said Father Brown.  "Let's have a look at the god."
And with an agility hardly to be expected of him, he hopped up
on to the raised platform.

     "Oh, very well," said Flambeau, laughing; and the next instant
his own towering figure was visible on that quaint elevation.

     Slight as was the difference of height, it gave in those level wastes
a sense of seeing yet farther and farther across land and sea.
Inland the little wintry gardens faded into a confused grey copse;
beyond that, in the distance, were long low barns of a lonely farmhouse,
and beyond that nothing but the long East Anglian plains.
Seawards there was no sail or sign of life save a few seagulls:
and even they looked like the last snowflakes, and seemed to float
rather than fly.

     Flambeau turned abruptly at an exclamation behind him.
It seemed to come from lower down than might have been expected,
and to be addressed to his heels rather than his head.  He instantly
held out his hand, but he could hardly help laughing at what he saw.
For some reason or other the platform had given way under Father Brown,
and the unfortunate little man had dropped through to the level
of the parade.  He was just tall enough, or short enough,
for his head alone to stick out of the hole in the broken wood,
looking like St John the Baptist's head on a charger.  The face wore
a disconcerted expression, as did, perhaps, that of St John the Baptist.

     In a moment he began to laugh a little.  "This wood must be rotten,"
said Flambeau.  "Though it seems odd it should bear me, and you go through
the weak place.  Let me help you out."

     But the little priest was looking rather curiously at the corners
and edges of the wood alleged to be rotten, and there was a sort of trouble
on his brow.

     "Come along," cried Flambeau impatiently, still with his big
brown hand extended.  "Don't you want to get out?"

     The priest was holding a splinter of the broken wood between
his finger and thumb, and did not immediately reply.  At last he said
thoughtfully:  "Want to get out?  Why, no.  I rather think I want
to get in." And he dived into the darkness under the wooden floor
so abruptly as to knock off his big curved clerical hat and leave it
lying on the boards above, without any clerical head in it.

     Flambeau looked once more inland and out to sea, and once more
could see nothing but seas as wintry as the snow, and snows as level
as the sea.

     There came a scurrying noise behind him, and the little priest
came scrambling out of the hole faster than he had fallen in.
His face was no longer disconcerted, but rather resolute, and,
perhaps only through the reflections of the snow, a trifle paler than usual.


     "Well?" asked his tall friend.  "Have you found the god
of the temple?"

     "No," answered Father Brown.  "I have found what was sometimes
more important.  The Sacrifice."

     "What the devil do you mean?" cried Flambeau, quite alarmed.

     Father Brown did not answer.  He was staring, with a knot
in his forehead, at the landscape; and he suddenly pointed at it.
"What's that house over there?" he asked.

     Following his finger, Flambeau saw for the first time the corners
of a building nearer than the farmhouse, but screened for the most part
with a fringe of trees.  It was not a large building, and stood well back
from the shore--, but a glint of ornament on it suggested that it was
part of the same watering-place scheme of decoration as the bandstand,
the little gardens and the curly-backed iron seats.

     Father Brown jumped off the bandstand, his friend following;
and as they walked in the direction indicated the trees fell away
to right and left, and they saw a small, rather flashy hotel,
such as is common in resorts--the hotel of the Saloon Bar rather than
the Bar Parlour.  Almost the whole frontage was of gilt plaster and
figured glass, and between that grey seascape and the grey,
witch-like trees, its gimcrack quality had something spectral
in its melancholy.  They both felt vaguely that if any food or drink
were offered at such a hostelry, it would be the paste-board ham
and empty mug of the pantomime.

     In this, however, they were not altogether confirmed.  As they drew
nearer and nearer to the place they saw in front of the buffet,
which was apparently closed, one of the iron garden-seats with curly backs
that had adorned the gardens, but much longer, running almost
the whole length of the frontage.  Presumably, it was placed so that
visitors might sit there and look at the sea, but one hardly expected
to find anyone doing it in such weather.

     Nevertheless, just in front of the extreme end of the iron seat
stood a small round restaurant table, and on this stood
a small bottle of Chablis and a plate of almonds and raisins.
Behind the table and on the seat sat a dark-haired young man,
bareheaded, and gazing at the sea in a state of almost
astonishing immobility.

     But though he might have been a waxwork when they were within
four yards of him, he jumped up like a jack-in-the-box when they
came within three, and said in a deferential, though not undignified,
manner:  "Will you step inside, gentlemen?  I have no staff at present,
but I can get you anything simple myself."

     "Much obliged," said Flambeau.  "So you are the proprietor?"

     "Yes," said the dark man, dropping back a little into
his motionless manner.  "My waiters are all Italians, you see,
and I thought it only fair they should see their countryman beat the black,
if he really can do it.  You know the great fight between Malvoli and
Nigger Ned is coming off after all?"

     "I'm afraid we can't wait to trouble your hospitality seriously,"
said Father Brown.  "But my friend would be glad of a glass of sherry,
I'm sure, to keep out the cold and drink success to the Latin champion."

     Flambeau did not understand the sherry, but he did not object to it
in the least.  He could only say amiably:  "Oh, thank you very much."

     "Sherry, sir--certainly," said their host, turning to his hostel.
"Excuse me if I detain you a few minutes.  As I told you,
I have no staff--" And he went towards the black windows of
his shuttered and unlighted inn.

     "Oh, it doesn't really matter," began Flambeau, but the man
turned to reassure him.

     "I have the keys," he said.  "I could find my way in the dark."

     "I didn't mean--" began Father Brown.

     He was interrupted by a bellowing human voice that came
out of the bowels of the uninhabited hotel.  It thundered
some foreign name loudly but inaudibly, and the hotel proprietor
moved more sharply towards it than he had done for Flambeau's sherry.
As instant evidence proved, the proprietor had told, then and after,
nothing but the literal truth.  But both Flambeau and Father Brown
have often confessed that, in all their (often outrageous) adventures,
nothing had so chilled their blood as that voice of an ogre,
sounding suddenly out of a silent and empty inn.

     "My cook!" cried the proprietor hastily.  "I had forgotten my cook.
He will be starting presently.  Sherry, sir?"

     And, sure enough, there appeared in the doorway a big white bulk
with white cap and white apron, as befits a cook, but with
the needless emphasis of a black face.  Flambeau had often heard
that negroes made good cooks.  But somehow something in the contrast
of colour and caste increased his surprise that the hotel proprietor
should answer the call of the cook, and not the cook the call
of the proprietor.  But he reflected that head cooks are proverbially
arrogant; and, besides, the host had come back with the sherry,
and that was the great thing.

     "I rather wonder," said Father Brown, "that there are so few people
about the beach, when this big fight is coming on after all.
We only met one man for miles."

     The hotel proprietor shrugged his shoulders.  "They come from
the other end of the town, you see--from the station, three miles from here.
They are only interested in the sport, and will stop in hotels
for the night only.  After all, it is hardly weather for
basking on the shore."

     "Or on the seat," said Flambeau, and pointed to the little table.

     "I have to keep a look-out," said the man with the motionless face.
He was a quiet, well-featured fellow, rather sallow; his dark clothes
had nothing distinctive about them, except that his black necktie
was worn rather high, like a stock, and secured by a gold pin
with some grotesque head to it.  Nor was there anything notable
in the face, except something that was probably a mere nervous trick--
a habit of opening one eye more narrowly than the other,
giving the impression that the other was larger, or was,
perhaps, artificial.

     The silence that ensued was broken by their host saying quietly:
"Whereabouts did you meet the one man on your march?"

     "Curiously enough," answered the priest, "close by here--
just by that bandstand."

     Flambeau, who had sat on the long iron seat to finish his sherry,
put it down and rose to his feet, staring at his friend in amazement.
He opened his mouth to speak, and then shut it again.

     "Curious," said the dark-haired man thoughtfully.  "What was he like?"

     "It was rather dark when I saw him," began Father Brown,
"but he was--"

     As has been said, the hotel-keeper can be proved to have told
the precise truth.  His phrase that the cook was starting presently
was fulfilled to the letter, for the cook came out, pulling his gloves on,
even as they spoke.

     But he was a very different figure from the confused mass
of white and black that had appeared for an instant in the doorway.
He was buttoned and buckled up to his bursting eyeballs in the most
brilliant fashion.  A tall black hat was tilted on his broad black head--
a hat of the sort that the French wit has compared to eight mirrors.
But somehow the black man was like the black hat.  He also was black,
and yet his glossy skin flung back the light at eight angles or more.
It is needless to say that he wore white spats and a white slip inside
his waistcoat.  The red flower stood up in his buttonhole aggressively,
as if it had suddenly grown there.  And in the way he carried his cane
in one hand and his cigar in the other there was a certain attitude--
an attitude we must always remember when we talk of racial prejudices:
something innocent and insolent--the cake walk.

     "Sometimes," said Flambeau, looking after him, "I'm not surprised
that they lynch them."

     "I am never surprised," said Father Brown, "at any work of hell.
But as I was saying," he resumed, as the negro, still ostentatiously
pulling on his yellow gloves, betook himself briskly towards
the watering-place, a queer music-hall figure against that grey and
frosty scene--"as I was saying, I couldn't describe the man very minutely,
but he had a flourish and old-fashioned whiskers and moustachios,
dark or dyed, as in the pictures of foreign financiers, round his neck
was wrapped a long purple scarf that thrashed out in the wind as he walked.
It was fixed at the throat rather in the way that nurses
fix children's comforters with a safety-pin.  Only this,"
added the priest, gazing placidly out to sea, "was not a safety-pin."

     The man sitting on the long iron bench was also gazing placidly
out to sea.  Now he was once more in repose.  Flambeau felt quite certain
that one of his eyes was naturally larger than the other.
Both were now well opened, and he could almost fancy the left eye
grew larger as he gazed.

     "It was a very long gold pin, and had the carved head of a monkey
or some such thing," continued the cleric; "and it was fixed
in a rather odd way--he wore pince-nez and a broad black--"

     The motionless man continued to gaze at the sea, and the eyes in
his head might have belonged to two different men.  Then he made
a movement of blinding swiftness.

     Father Brown had his back to him, and in that flash might have
fallen dead on his face.  Flambeau had no weapon, but his large
brown hands were resting on the end of the long iron seat.
His shoulders abruptly altered their shape, and he heaved
the whole huge thing high over his head, like a headsman's axe
about to fall.  The mere height of the thing, as he held it vertical,
looked like a long iron ladder by which he was inviting men to climb
towards the stars.  But the long shadow, in the level evening light,
looked like a giant brandishing the Eiffel Tower.  It was the shock
of that shadow, before the shock of the iron crash, that made the stranger
quail and dodge, and then dart into his inn, leaving the flat and
shining dagger he had dropped exactly where it had fallen.

     "We must get away from here instantly," cried Flambeau,
flinging the huge seat away with furious indifference on the beach.
He caught the little priest by the elbow and ran him down
a grey perspective of barren back garden, at the end of which there
was a closed back garden door.  Flambeau bent over it an instant
in violent silence, and then said:  "The door is locked."

     As he spoke a black feather from one of the ornamental firs fell,
brushing the brim of his hat.  It startled him more than the small
and distant detonation that had come just before.  Then came another
distant detonation, and the door he was trying to open shook
under the bullet buried in it.  Flambeau's shoulders again filled out
and altered suddenly.  Three hinges and a lock burst at the same instant,
and he went out into the empty path behind, carrying the great garden door
with him, as Samson carried the gates of Gaza.

     Then he flung the garden door over the garden wall, just as
a third shot picked up a spurt of snow and dust behind his heel.
Without ceremony he snatched up the little priest, slung him astraddle
on his shoulders, and went racing towards Seawood as fast as
his long legs could carry him.  It was not until nearly two miles
farther on that he set his small companion down.  It had hardly been
a dignified escape, in spite of the classic model of Anchises,
but Father Brown's face only wore a broad grin.

     "Well," said Flambeau, after an impatient silence, as they resumed
their more conventional tramp through the streets on the edge of the town,
where no outrage need be feared, "I don't know what all this means,
but I take it I may trust my own eyes that you never met the man
you have so accurately described."

     "I did meet him in a way," Brown said, biting his finger
rather nervously--"I did really.  And it was too dark to see him properly,
because it was under that bandstand affair.  But I'm afraid I didn't
describe him so very accurately after all, for his pince-nez
was broken under him, and the long gold pin wasn't stuck through
his purple scarf but through his heart."

     "And I suppose," said the other in a lower voice, "that glass-eyed guy
had something to do with it."

     "I had hoped he had only a little," answered Brown
in a rather troubled voice, "and I may have been wrong in what I did.
I acted on impulse.  But I fear this business has deep roots and dark."

     They walked on through some streets in silence.  The yellow lamps
were beginning to be lit in the cold blue twilight, and they were
evidently approaching the more central parts of the town.
Highly coloured bills announcing the glove-fight between Nigger Ned
and Malvoli were slapped about the walls.

     "Well," said Flambeau, "I never murdered anyone, even in
my criminal days, but I can almost sympathize with anyone doing it
in such a dreary place.  Of all God-forsaken dustbins of Nature,
I think the most heart-breaking are places like that bandstand,
that were meant to be festive and are forlorn.  I can fancy a morbid man
feeling he must kill his rival in the solitude and irony of such a scene.
I remember once taking a tramp in your glorious Surrey hills,
thinking of nothing but gorse and skylarks, when I came out on
a vast circle of land, and over me lifted a vast, voiceless structure,
tier above tier of seats, as huge as a Roman amphitheatre and as empty
as a new letter-rack.  A bird sailed in heaven over it.  It was
the Grand Stand at Epsom.  And I felt that no one would ever
be happy there again."

     "It's odd you should mention Epsom," said the priest.
"Do you remember what was called the Sutton Mystery, because two
suspected men--ice-cream men, I think--happened to live at Sutton?
They were eventually released.  A man was found strangled, it was said,
on the Downs round that part.  As a fact, I know (from an Irish policeman
who is a friend of mine) that he was found close up to the Epsom
Grand Stand--in fact, only hidden by one of the lower doors being
pushed back."

     "That is queer," assented Flambeau.  "But it rather confirms
my view that such pleasure places look awfully lonely out of season,
or the man wouldn't have been murdered there."

     "I'm not so sure he--" began Brown, and stopped.

     "Not so sure he was murdered?" queried his companion.

     "Not so sure he was murdered out of the season," answered
the little priest, with simplicity.  "Don't you think there's something
rather tricky about this solitude, Flambeau?  Do you feel sure
a wise murderer would always want the spot to be lonely?
It's very, very seldom a man is quite alone.  And, short of that,
the more alone he is, the more certain he is to be seen.
No; I think there must be some other--Why, here we are at
the Pavilion or Palace, or whatever they call it."

     They had emerged on a small square, brilliantly lighted,
of which the principal building was gay with gilding, gaudy with posters,
and flanked with two giant photographs of Malvoli and Nigger Ned.

     "Hallo!" cried Flambeau in great surprise, as his clerical friend
stumped straight up the broad steps.  "I didn't know pugilism was
your latest hobby.  Are you going to see the fight?"

     "I don't think there will be any fight," replied Father Brown.

     They passed rapidly through ante-rooms and inner rooms;
they passed through the hall of combat itself, raised, roped,
and padded with innumerable seats and boxes, and still the cleric did
not look round or pause till he came to a clerk at a desk outside
a door marked "Committee".  There he stopped and asked to see Lord Pooley.

     The attendant observed that his lordship was very busy,
as the fight was coming on soon, but Father Brown had a good-tempered
tedium of reiteration for which the official mind is generally not prepared.
In a few moments the rather baffled Flambeau found himself in the presence
of a man who was still shouting directions to another man going out of
the room.  "Be careful, you know, about the ropes after the fourth--
Well, and what do you want, I wonder!"

     Lord Pooley was a gentleman, and, like most of the few remaining
to our race, was worried--especially about money.  He was half grey
and half flaxen, and he had the eyes of fever and a high-bridged,
frost-bitten nose.

     "Only a word," said Father Brown.  "I have come to prevent
a man being killed."

     Lord Pooley bounded off his chair as if a spring had
flung him from it.  "I'm damned if I'll stand any more of this!"
he cried.  "You and your committees and parsons and petitions!
Weren't there parsons in the old days, when they fought without gloves?
Now they're fighting with the regulation gloves, and there's not
the rag of a possibility of either of the boxers being killed."

     "I didn't mean either of the boxers," said the little priest.

     "Well, well, well!" said the nobleman, with a touch of frosty humour.
"Who's going to be killed?  The referee?"

     "I don't know who's going to be killed," replied Father Brown,
with a reflective stare.  "If I did I shouldn't have to
spoil your pleasure.  I could simply get him to escape.
I never could see anything wrong about prize-fights.  As it is,
I must ask you to announce that the fight is off for the present."

     "Anything else?" jeered the gentleman with feverish eyes.
"And what do you say to the two thousand people who have come to see it?"

     "I say there will be one thousand nine-hundred and ninety-nine
of them left alive when they have seen it," said Father Brown.

     Lord Pooley looked at Flambeau.  "Is your friend mad?" he asked.

     "Far from it," was the reply.

     "And took here," resumed Pooley in his restless way,
"it's worse than that.  A whole pack of Italians have turned up
to back Malvoli--swarthy, savage fellows of some country, anyhow.
You know what these Mediterranean races are like.  If I send out word
that it's off we shall have Malvoli storming in here at the head of
a whole Corsican clan."

     "My lord, it is a matter of life and death," said the priest.
"Ring your bell.  Give your message.  And see whether it is Malvoli
who answers."

     The nobleman struck the bell on the table with an odd air
of new curiosity.  He said to the clerk who appeared almost instantly
in the doorway:  "I have a serious announcement to make to the audience
shortly.  Meanwhile, would you kindly tell the two champions that
the fight will have to be put off."

     The clerk stared for some seconds as if at a demon and vanished.

     "What authority have you for what you say?" asked Lord Pooley
abruptly.  "Whom did you consult?"

     "I consulted a bandstand," said Father Brown, scratching his head.
"But, no, I'm wrong; I consulted a book, too.  I  picked it up
on a bookstall in London--very cheap, too."

     He had taken out of his pocket a small, stout, leather-bound volume,
and Flambeau, looking over his shoulder, could see that it was some
book of old travels, and had a leaf turned down for reference.

     "`The only form in which Voodoo--'" began Father Brown, reading aloud.

     "In which what?" inquired his lordship.

     "`In which Voodoo,'" repeated the reader, almost with relish,
"`is widely organized outside Jamaica itself is in the form known as
the Monkey, or the God of the Gongs, which is powerful in many parts of
the two American continents, especially among half-breeds, many of whom
look exactly like white men.  It differs from most other forms
of devil-worship and human sacrifice in the fact that the blood
is not shed formally on the altar, but by a sort of assassination
among the crowd.  The gongs beat with a deafening din as
the doors of the shrine open and the monkey-god is revealed;
almost the whole congregation rivet ecstatic eyes on him.  But after--'"

     The door of the room was flung open, and the fashionable negro
stood framed in it, his eyeballs rolling, his silk hat still insolently
tilted on his head.  "Huh!" he cried, showing his apish teeth.
"What this?  Huh!  Huh!  You steal a coloured gentleman's prize--
prize his already--yo' think yo' jes' save that white 'Talian trash--"

     "The matter is only deferred," said the nobleman quietly.
"I will be with you to explain in a minute or two."

     "Who you to--" shouted Nigger Ned, beginning to storm.

     "My name is Pooley," replied the other, with a creditable coolness.
"I am the organizing secretary, and I advise you just now
to leave the room."

     "Who this fellow?" demanded the dark champion, pointing to the
priest disdainfully.

     "My name is Brown," was the reply.  "And I advise you just now
to leave the country."

     The prize-fighter stood glaring for a few seconds, and then,
rather to the surprise of Flambeau and the others, strode out,
sending the door to with a crash behind him.

     "Well," asked Father Brown rubbing his dusty hair up,
"what do you think of Leonardo da Vinci?  A beautiful Italian head."

     "Look here," said Lord Pooley, "I've taken a considerable responsibility,
on your bare word.  I think you ought to tell me more about this."

     "You are quite right, my lord," answered Brown.  "And it won't take
long to tell." He put the little leather book in his overcoat pocket.
"I think we know all that this can tell us, but you shall look at it
to see if I'm right.  That negro who has just swaggered out is one of
the most dangerous men on earth, for he has the brains of a European,
with the instincts of a cannibal.  He has turned what was clean,
common-sense butchery among his fellow-barbarians into a very modern
and scientific secret society of assassins.  He doesn't know I know it,
nor, for the matter of that, that I can't prove it."

     There was a silence, and the little man went on.

     "But if I want to murder somebody, will it really be the best plan
to make sure I'm alone with him?"

     Lord Pooley's eyes recovered their frosty twinkle as he
looked at the little clergyman.  He only said:  "If you want to
murder somebody, I should advise it."

     Father Brown shook his head, like a murderer of much riper experience.
"So Flambeau said," he replied, with a sigh.  "But consider.
The more a man feels lonely the less he can be sure he is alone.
It must mean empty spaces round him, and they are just what
make him obvious.  Have you never seen one ploughman from the heights,
or one shepherd from the valleys? Have you never walked along a cliff,
and seen one man walking along the sands?  Didn't you know when he's
killed a crab, and wouldn't you have known if it had been a creditor?
No! No! No!  For an intelligent murderer, such as you or I might be,
it is an impossible plan to make sure that nobody is looking at you."

     "But what other plan is there?"

     "There is only one," said the priest.  "To make sure
that everybody is looking at something else.  A man is throttled
close by the big stand at Epsom.  Anybody might have seen it done
while the stand stood empty--any tramp under the hedges or motorist
among the hills.  But nobody would have seen it when the stand
was crowded and the whole ring roaring, when the favourite was
coming in first--or wasn't.  The twisting of a neck-cloth,
the thrusting of a body behind a door could be done in an instant--
so long as it was that instant.  It was the same, of course,"
he continued turning to Flambeau, "with that poor fellow
under the bandstand.  He was dropped through the hole (it wasn't
an accidental hole) just at some very dramatic moment of the entertainment,
when the bow of some great violinist or the voice of some great singer
opened or came to its climax.  And here, of course, when the knock-out
blow came--it would not be the only one.  That is the little trick
Nigger Ned has adopted from his old God of Gongs."

     "By the way, Malvoli--" Pooley began.

     "Malvoli," said the priest, "has nothing to do with it.
I dare say he has some Italians with him, but our amiable friends
are not Italians.  They are octoroons and African half-bloods
of various shades, but I fear we English think all foreigners
are much the same so long as they are dark and dirty.  Also,"
he added, with a smile, "I fear the English decline to draw
any fine distinction between the moral character produced by my religion
and that which blooms out of Voodoo."

     The blaze of the spring season had burst upon Seawood,
littering its foreshore with famines and bathing-machines,
with nomadic preachers and nigger minstrels, before the two friends
saw it again, and long before the storm of pursuit after the strange
secret society had died away.  Almost on every hand the secret
of their purpose perished with them.  The man of the hotel was found
drifting dead on the sea like so much seaweed; his right eye was
closed in peace, but his left eye was wide open, and glistened like glass
in the moon.  Nigger Ned had been overtaken a mile or two away,
and murdered three policemen with his closed left hand.
The remaining officer was surprised--nay, pained--and the negro got away.
But this was enough to set all the English papers in a flame,
and for a month or two the main purpose of the British Empire was
to prevent the buck nigger (who was so in both senses) escaping by any
English port.  Persons of a figure remotely reconcilable with his
were subjected to quite extraordinary inquisitions, made to scrub
their faces before going on board ship, as if each white complexion
were made up like a mask, of greasepaint.  Every negro in England
was put under special regulations and made to report himself;
the outgoing ships would no more have taken a nigger than a basilisk.
For people had found out how fearful and vast and silent was
the force of the savage secret society, and by the time Flambeau and
Father Brown were leaning on the parade parapet in April, the Black Man
meant in England almost what he once meant in Scotland.

     "He must be still in England," observed Flambeau, "and horridly
well hidden, too.  They must have found him at the ports if he had
only whitened his face."

     "You see, he is really a clever man," said Father Brown
apologetically.  "And I'm sure he wouldn't whiten his face."

     "Well, but what would he do?"

     "I think," said Father Brown, "he would blacken his face."

     Flambeau, leaning motionless on the parapet, laughed and said:
"My dear fellow!"

     Father Brown, also leaning motionless on the parapet, moved one finger
for an instant into the direction of the soot-masked niggers singing
on the sands.




X. The Salad of Colonel Cray


FATHER BROWN was walking home from Mass on a white weird morning
when the mists were slowly lifting--one of those mornings when
the very element of light appears as something mysterious and new.
The scattered trees outlined themselves more and more out of the vapour,
as if they were first drawn in grey chalk and then in charcoal.
At yet more distant intervals appeared the houses upon the broken fringe
of the suburb; their outlines became clearer and clearer until
he recognized many in which he had chance acquaintances, and many more
the names of whose owners he knew.  But all the windows and doors
were sealed; none of the people were of the sort that would be up
at such a time, or still less on such an errand.  But as he passed under
the shadow of one handsome villa with verandas and wide ornate gardens,
he heard a noise that made him almost involuntarily stop.
It was the unmistakable noise of a pistol or carbine or some
light firearm discharged; but it was not this that puzzled him most.
The first full noise was immediately followed by a series of fainter noises--
as he counted them, about six.  He supposed it must be the echo;
but the odd thing was that the echo was not in the least like
the original sound.  It was not like anything else that he could think of;
the three things nearest to it seemed to be the noise made by
siphons of soda-water, one of the many noises made by an animal,
and the noise made by a person attempting to conceal laughter.
None of which seemed to make much sense.

     Father Brown was made of two men.  There was a man of action,
who was as modest as a primrose and as punctual as a clock;
who went his small round of duties and never dreamed of altering it.
There was also a man of reflection, who was much simpler but much stronger,
who could not easily be stopped; whose thought was always (in the only
intelligent sense of the words) free thought.  He could not help,
even unconsciously, asking himself all the questions that
there were to be asked, and answering as many of them as he could;
all that went on like his breathing or circulation.  But he never
consciously carried his actions outside the sphere of his own duty;
and in this case the two attitudes were aptly tested.  He was just about
to resume his trudge in the twilight, telling himself it was no affair
of his, but instinctively twisting and untwisting twenty theories
about what the odd noises might mean.  Then the grey sky-line
brightened into silver, and in the broadening light he realized
that he had been to the house which belonged to an Anglo-Indian Major
named Putnam; and that the Major had a native cook from Malta who was
of his communion.  He also began to remember that pistol-shots
are sometimes serious things; accompanied with consequences with which
he was legitimately concerned.  He turned back and went in
at the garden gate, making for the front door.

     Half-way down one side of the house stood out a projection
like a very low shed; it was, as he afterwards discovered,
a large dustbin.  Round the corner of this came a figure,
at first a mere shadow in the haze, apparently bending and peering about.
Then, coming nearer, it solidified into a figure that was, indeed,
rather unusually solid.  Major Putnam was a bald-headed, bull-necked man,
short and very broad, with one of those rather apoplectic faces
that are produced by a prolonged attempt to combine the oriental climate
with the occidental luxuries.  But the face was a good-humoured one,
and even now, though evidently puzzled and inquisitive, wore a kind of
innocent grin.  He had a large palm-leaf hat on the back of his head
(suggesting a halo that was by no means appropriate to the face),
but otherwise he was clad only in a very vivid suit of striped scarlet
and yellow pyjamas; which, though glowing enough to behold, must have been,
on a fresh morning, pretty chilly to wear.  He had evidently
come out of his house in a hurry, and the priest was not surprised
when he called out without further ceremony:  "Did you hear that noise?"

     "Yes," answered Father Brown; "I thought I had better look in,
in case anything was the matter."

     The Major looked at him rather queerly with his good-humoured
gooseberry eyes.  "What do you think the noise was?" he asked.

     "It sounded like a gun or something," replied the other,
with some hesitation; "but it seemed to have a singular sort of echo."

     The Major was still looking at him quietly, but with protruding eyes,
when the front door was flung open, releasing a flood of gaslight
on the face of the fading mist; and another figure in pyjamas sprang
or tumbled out into the garden.  The figure was much longer, leaner,
and more athletic; the pyjamas, though equally tropical, were
comparatively tasteful, being of white with a light lemon-yellow stripe.
The man was haggard, but handsome, more sunburned than the other;
he had an aquiline profile and rather deep-sunken eyes, and a slight air
of oddity arising from the combination of coal-black hair with
a much lighter moustache.  All this Father Brown absorbed in detail
more at leisure.  For the moment he only saw one thing about the man;
which was the revolver in his hand.

     "Cray!" exclaimed the Major, staring at him; "did you fire that shot?"

     "Yes, I did," retorted the black-haired gentleman hotly;
"and so would you in my place.  If you were chased everywhere
by devils and nearly--"

     The Major seemed to intervene rather hurriedly.  "This is my friend
Father Brown," he said.  And then to Brown:  "I don't know whether
you've met Colonel Cray of the Royal Artillery."

     "I have heard of him, of course," said the priest innocently.
"Did you--did you hit anything?"

     "I thought so," answered Cray with gravity.

     "Did he--" asked Major Putnam in a lowered voice, "did he fall
or cry out, or anything?"

     Colonel Cray was regarding his host with a strange and steady stare.
"I'll tell you exactly what he did," he said.  "He sneezed."

     Father Brown's hand went half-way to his head, with the gesture
of a man remembering somebody's name.  He knew now what it was
that was neither soda-water nor the snorting of a dog.

     "Well," ejaculated the staring Major, "I never heard before
that a service revolver was a thing to be sneezed at."

     "Nor I," said Father Brown faintly.  "It's lucky you didn't
turn your artillery on him or you might have given him quite a bad cold."
Then, after a bewildered pause, he said:  "Was it a burglar?"

     "Let us go inside," said Major Putnam, rather sharply,
and led the way into his house.

     The interior exhibited a paradox often to be marked in such
morning hours:  that the rooms seemed brighter than the sky outside;
even after the Major had turned out the one gaslight in the front hall.
Father Brown was surprised to see the whole dining-table set out
as for a festive meal, with napkins in their rings, and wine-glasses
of some six unnecessary shapes set beside every plate.  It was common enough,
at that time of the morning, to find the remains of a banquet over-night;
but to find it freshly spread so early was unusual.

     While he stood wavering in the hall Major Putnam rushed past him
and sent a raging eye over the whole oblong of the tablecloth.
At last he spoke, spluttering:  "All the silver gone!" he gasped.
"Fish-knives and forks gone.  Old cruet-stand gone.  Even the old silver
cream-jug gone.  And now, Father Brown, I am ready to answer your question
of whether it was a burglar."

     "They're simply a blind," said Cray stubbornly.  "I know better
than you why people persecute this house; I know better than you why--"

     The Major patted him on the shoulder with a gesture almost peculiar
to the soothing of a sick child, and said:  "It was a burglar.
Obviously it was a burglar."

     "A burglar with a bad cold," observed Father Brown, "that might
assist you to trace him in the neighbourhood."

     The Major shook his head in a sombre manner.  "He must be far beyond
trace now, I fear," he said.

     Then, as the restless man with the revolver turned again towards
the door in the garden, he added in a husky, confidential voice:
"I doubt whether I should send for the police, for fear my friend here
has been a little too free with his bullets, and got on the wrong side
of the law.  He's lived in very wild places; and, to be frank with you,
I think he sometimes fancies things."

     "I think you once told me," said Brown, "that he believes some
Indian secret society is pursuing him."

     Major Putnam nodded, but at the same time shrugged his shoulders.
"I suppose we'd better follow him outside," he said.  "I don't want
any more--shall we say, sneezing?"

     They passed out into the morning light, which was now even tinged
with sunshine, and saw Colonel Cray's tall figure bent almost double,
minutely examining the condition of gravel and grass.  While the Major
strolled unobtrusively towards him, the priest took an equally
indolent turn, which took him round the next corner of the house
to within a yard or two of the projecting dustbin.

     He stood regarding this dismal object for some minute and a half--,
then he stepped towards it, lifted the lid and put his head inside.
Dust and other discolouring matter shook upwards as he did so;
but Father Brown never observed his own appearance, whatever else
he observed.  He remained thus for a measurable period, as if engaged
in some mysterious prayers.  Then he came out again, with some ashes
on his hair, and walked unconcernedly away.

     By the time he came round to the garden door again he found
a group there which seemed to roll away morbidities as the sunlight
had already rolled away the mists.  It was in no way rationally reassuring;
it was simply broadly comic, like a cluster of Dickens's characters.
Major Putnam had managed to slip inside and plunge into a proper shirt and
trousers, with a crimson cummerbund, and a light square jacket over all;
thus normally set off, his red festive face seemed bursting with
a commonplace cordiality.  He was indeed emphatic, but then he was talking
to his cook--the swarthy son of Malta, whose lean, yellow and rather
careworn face contrasted quaintly with his snow-white cap and costume.
The cook might well be careworn, for cookery was the Major's hobby.
He was one of those amateurs who always know more than the professional.
The only other person he even admitted to be a judge of an omelette
was his friend Cray--and as Brown remembered this, he turned to look
for the other officer.  In the new presence of daylight and people clothed
and in their right mind, the sight of him was rather a shock.
The taller and more elegant man was still in his night-garb,
with tousled black hair, and now crawling about the garden on his hands
and knees, still looking for traces of the burglar; and now and again,
to all appearance, striking the ground with his hand in anger at not
finding him.  Seeing him thus quadrupedal in the grass, the priest
raised his eyebrows rather sadly; and for the first time guessed that
"fancies things" might be an euphemism.

     The third item in the group of the cook and the epicure was also
known to Father Brown; it was Audrey Watson, the Major's ward
and housekeeper; and at this moment, to judge by her apron,
tucked-up sleeves and resolute manner, much more the housekeeper
than the ward.

     "It serves you right," she was saying:  "I always told you
not to have that old-fashioned cruet-stand."

     "I prefer it," said Putnam, placably.  "I'm old-fashioned myself;
and the things keep together."

     "And vanish together, as you see," she retorted.  "Well, if you are
not going to bother about the burglar, I shouldn't bother about the lunch.
It's Sunday, and we can't send for vinegar and all that in the town;
and you Indian gentlemen can't enjoy what you call a dinner without
a lot of hot things.  I wish to goodness now you hadn't asked
Cousin Oliver to take me to the musical service.  It isn't over
till half-past twelve, and the Colonel has to leave by then.
I don't believe you men can manage alone."

     "Oh yes, we can, my dear," said the Major, looking at her
very amiably.  "Marco has all the sauces, and we've often
done ourselves well in very rough places, as you might know by now.
And it's time you had a treat, Audrey; you mustn't be a housekeeper
every hour of the day; and I know you want to hear the music."

     "I want to go to church," she said, with rather severe eyes.

     She was one of those handsome women who will always be handsome,
because the beauty is not in an air or a tint, but in the very structure
of the head and features.  But though she was not yet middle-aged
and her auburn hair was of a Titianesque fullness in form and colour,
there was a look in her mouth and around her eyes which suggested that
some sorrows wasted her, as winds waste at last the edges of a Greek temple.
For indeed the little domestic difficulty of which she was now speaking
so decisively was rather comic than tragic.  Father Brown gathered,
from the course of the conversation, that Cray, the other gourmet,
had to leave before the usual lunch-time; but that Putnam, his host,
not to be done out of a final feast with an old crony, had arranged
for a special dejeuner to be set out and consumed in the course of
the morning, while Audrey and other graver persons were at morning service.
She was going there under the escort of a relative and old friend of hers,
Dr Oliver Oman, who, though a scientific man of a somewhat bitter type,
was enthusiastic for music, and would go even to church to get it.
There was nothing in all this that could conceivably concern
the tragedy in Miss Watson's face; and by a half conscious instinct,
Father Brown turned again to the seeming lunatic grubbing about
in the grass.

     When he strolled across to him, the black, unbrushed head was
lifted abruptly, as if in some surprise at his continued presence.
And indeed, Father Brown, for reasons best known to himself,
had lingered much longer than politeness required; or even,
in the ordinary sense, permitted.

     "Well!" cried Cray, with wild eyes.  "I suppose you think I'm mad,
like the rest?"

     "I have considered the thesis," answered the little man, composedly.
"And I incline to think you are not."

     "What do you mean?" snapped Cray quite savagely.

     "Real madmen," explained Father Brown, "always encourage their
own morbidity.  They never strive against it.  But you are trying
to find traces of the burglar; even when there aren't any.
You are struggling against it.  You want what no madman ever wants."

     "And what is that?"

     "You want to be proved wrong," said Brown.

     During the last words Cray had sprung or staggered to his feet
and was regarding the cleric with agitated eyes.  "By hell,
but that is a true word!" he cried.  "They are all at me here
that the fellow was only after the silver--as if I shouldn't be
only too pleased to think so!  She's been at me," and he tossed his tousled
black head towards Audrey, but the other had no need of the direction,
"she's been at me today about how cruel I was to shoot a poor harmless
house-breaker, and how I have the devil in me against poor harmless natives.
But I was a good-natured man once--as good-natured as Putnam."

     After a pause he said:  "Look here, I've never seen you before;
but you shall judge of the whole story.  Old Putnam and I were friends
in the same mess; but, owing to some accidents on the Afghan border,
I got my command much sooner than most men; only we were both
invalided home for a bit.  I was engaged to Audrey out there;
and we all travelled back together.  But on the journey back
things happened.  Curious things.  The result of them was
that Putnam wants it broken off, and even Audrey keeps it hanging on--
and I know what they mean.  I know what they think I am.  So do you.

     "Well, these are the facts.  The last day we were in
an Indian city I asked Putnam if I could get some Trichinopoli cigars,
he directed me to a little place opposite his lodgings.
I have since found he was quite right; but `opposite' is a dangerous word
when one decent house stands opposite five or six squalid ones;
and I must have mistaken the door.  It opened with difficulty,
and then only on darkness; but as I turned back, the door behind me
sank back and settled into its place with a noise as of innumerable bolts.
There was nothing to do but to walk forward; which I did through
passage after passage, pitch-dark.  Then I came to a flight of steps,
and then to a blind door, secured by a latch of elaborate Eastern ironwork,
which I could only trace by touch, but which I loosened at last.
I came out again upon gloom, which was half turned into
a greenish twilight by a multitude of small but steady lamps below.
They showed merely the feet or fringes of some huge and empty architecture.
Just in front of me was something that looked like a mountain.
I confess I nearly fell on the great stone platform on which I had emerged,
to realize that it was an idol.  And worst of all, an idol with
its back to me.

     "It was hardly half human, I guessed; to judge by the small squat head,
and still more by a thing like a tail or extra limb turned up behind
and pointing, like a loathsome large finger, at some symbol graven
in the centre of the vast stone back.  I had begun, in the dim light,
to guess at the hieroglyphic, not without horror, when a more horrible
thing happened.  A door opened silently in the temple wall
behind me and a man came out, with a brown face and a black coat.
He had a carved smile on his face, of copper flesh and ivory teeth;
but I think the most hateful thing about him was that he was
in European dress.  I was prepared, I think, for shrouded priests
or naked fakirs.  But this seemed to say that the devilry was
over all the earth.  As indeed I found it to be.

     "`If you had only seen the Monkey's Feet,' he said, smiling steadily,
and without other preface, `we should have been very gentle--
you would only be tortured and die.  If you had seen the Monkey's Face,
still we should be very moderate, very tolerant--you would only
be tortured and live.  But as you have seen the Monkey's Tail,
we must pronounce the worst sentence. which is--Go Free.'

     "When he said the words I heard the elaborate iron latch with
which I had struggled, automatically unlock itself:  and then,
far down the dark passages I had passed, I heard the heavy street-door
shifting its own bolts backwards.

     "`It is vain to ask for mercy; you must go free,' said
the smiling man.  `Henceforth a hair shall slay you like a sword,
and a breath shall bite you like an adder; weapons shall come
against you out of nowhere; and you shall die many times.'
And with that he was swallowed once more in the wall behind;
and I went out into the street."

     Cray paused; and Father Brown unaffectedly sat down on the lawn
and began to pick daisies.

     Then the soldier continued:  "Putnam, of course, with his
jolly common sense, pooh-poohed all my fears; and from that time
dates his doubt of my mental balance.  Well, I'll simply tell you,
in the fewest words, the three things that have happened since;
and you shall judge which of us is right.

     "The first happened in an Indian village on the edge of the jungle,
but hundreds of miles from the temple, or town, or type of tribes
and customs where the curse had been put on me.  I woke in black midnight,
and lay thinking of nothing in particular, when I felt a faint
tickling thing, like a thread or a hair, trailed across my throat.
I shrank back out of its way, and could not help thinking of the words
in the temple.  But when I got up and sought lights and a mirror,
the line across my neck was a line of blood.

     "The second happened in a lodging in Port Said, later,
on our journey home together.  It was a jumble of tavern
and curiosity-shop; and though there was nothing there remotely suggesting
the cult of the Monkey, it is, of course, possible that some of its
images or talismans were in such a place.  Its curse was there, anyhow.
I woke again in the dark with a sensation that could not be put
in colder or more literal words than that a breath bit like an adder.
Existence was an agony of extinction; I dashed my head against walls
until I dashed it against a window; and fell rather than jumped
into the garden below.  Putnam, poor fellow, who had called the other thing
a chance scratch, was bound to take seriously the fact of finding me
half insensible on the grass at dawn.  But I fear it was my mental state
he took seriously; and not my story.

     "The third happened in Malta.  We were in a fortress there;
and as it happened our bedrooms overlooked the open sea, which almost
came up to our window-sills, save for a flat white outer wall
as bare as the sea.  I woke up again; but it was not dark.
There was a full moon, as I walked to the window; I could have seen a bird
on the bare battlement, or a sail on the horizon.  What I did see
was a sort of stick or branch circling, self-supported, in the empty sky.
It flew straight in at my window and smashed the lamp beside the pillow
I had just quitted.  It was one of those queer-shaped war-clubs
some Eastern tribes use.  But it had come from no human hand."

     Father Brown threw away a daisy-chain he was making,
and rose with a wistful look.  "Has Major Putnam," he asked,
"got any Eastern curios, idols, weapons and so on, from which
one might get a hint?"

     "Plenty of those, though not much use, I fear," replied Cray;
"but by all means come into his study."

     As they entered they passed Miss Watson buttoning her gloves for church,
and heard the voice of Putnam downstairs still giving a lecture on cookery
to the cook.  In the Major's study and den of curios they came suddenly
on a third party, silk-hatted and dressed for the street, who was
poring over an open book on the smoking-table--a book which he dropped
rather guiltily, and turned.

     Cray introduced him civilly enough, as Dr Oman, but he showed
such disfavour in his very face that Brown guessed the two men,
whether Audrey knew it or not, were rivals.  Nor was the priest
wholly unsympathetic with the prejudice.  Dr Oman was a very well-dressed
gentleman indeed; well-featured, though almost dark enough for an Asiatic.
But Father Brown had to tell himself sharply that one should be in charity
even with those who wax their pointed beards, who have small gloved hands,
and who speak with perfectly modulated voices.

     Cray seemed to find something specially irritating in
the small prayer-book in Oman's dark-gloved hand.  "I didn't know
that was in your line," he said rather rudely.

     Oman laughed mildly, but without offence.  "This is more so, I know,"
he said, laying his hand on the big book he had dropped,
"a dictionary of drugs and such things.  But it's rather too large
to take to church."  Then he closed the larger book, and there seemed
again the faintest touch of hurry and embarrassment.

     "I suppose," said the priest, who seemed anxious to change the subject,
"all these spears and things are from India?"

     "From everywhere," answered the doctor.  "Putnam is an old soldier,
and has been in Mexico and Australia, and the Cannibal Islands
for all I know."

     "I hope it was not in the Cannibal Islands," said Brown,
"that he learnt the art of cookery." And he ran his eyes over
the stew-pots or other strange utensils on the wall.

     At this moment the jolly subject of their conversation
thrust his laughing, lobsterish face into the room.  "Come along, Cray,"
he cried.  "Your lunch is just coming in.  And the bells are ringing
for those who want to go to church."

     Cray slipped upstairs to change; Dr Oman and Miss Watson betook
themselves solemnly down the street, with a string of other churchgoers;
but Father Brown noticed that the doctor twice looked back
and scrutinized the house; and even came back to the corner of the street
to look at it again.

     The priest looked puzzled.  "He can't have been at the dustbin,"
he muttered.  "Not in those clothes.  Or was he there earlier today?"

     Father Brown, touching other people, was as sensitive as a barometer;
but today he seemed about as sensitive as a rhinoceros.  By no social law,
rigid or implied, could he be supposed to linger round the lunch
of the Anglo-Indian friends; but he lingered, covering his position
with torrents of amusing but quite needless conversation.
He was the more puzzling because he did not seem to want any lunch.
As one after another of the most exquisitely balanced kedgerees of curries,
accompanied with their appropriate vintages, were laid before
the other two, he only repeated that it was one of his fast-days,
and munched a piece of bread and sipped and then left untasted
a tumbler of cold water.  His talk, however, was exuberant.

     "I'll tell you what I'll do for you," he cried--, "I'll mix you
a salad!  I can't eat it, but I'll mix it like an angel!
You've got a lettuce there."

     "Unfortunately it's the only thing we have got," answered
the good-humoured Major.  "You must remember that mustard, vinegar,
oil and so on vanished with the cruet and the burglar."

     "I know," replied Brown, rather vaguely.  "That's what I've always
been afraid would happen.  That's why I always carry a cruet-stand
about with me.  I'm so fond of salads."

     And to the amazement of the two men he took a pepper-pot out of
his waistcoat pocket and put it on the table.

     "I wonder why the burglar wanted mustard, too," he went on,
taking a mustard-pot from another pocket.  "A mustard plaster,
I suppose.  And vinegar"--and producing that condiment--
"haven't I heard something about vinegar and brown paper?
As for oil, which I think I put in my left--"

     His garrulity was an instant arrested; for lifting his eyes,
he saw what no one else saw--the black figure of Dr Oman standing
on the sunlit lawn and looking steadily into the room.  Before he could
quite recover himself Cray had cloven in.

     "You're an astounding card," he said, staring.  "I shall come
and hear your sermons, if they're as amusing as your manners."
His voice changed a little, and he leaned back in his chair.

     "Oh, there are sermons in a cruet-stand, too," said Father Brown,
quite gravely.  "Have you heard of faith like a grain of mustard-seed;
or charity that anoints with oil?  And as for vinegar, can any soldiers
forget that solitary soldier, who, when the sun was darkened--"

     Colonel Cray leaned forward a little and clutched the tablecloth.

     Father Brown, who was making the salad, tipped two spoonfuls
of the mustard into the tumbler of water beside him; stood up and said
in a new, loud and sudden voice--"Drink that!"

     At the same moment the motionless doctor in the garden came running,
and bursting open a window cried:  "Am I wanted?  Has he been poisoned?"

     "Pretty near," said Brown, with the shadow of a smile; for
the emetic had very suddenly taken effect.  And Cray lay in a deck-chair,
gasping as for life, but alive.

     Major Putnam had sprung up, his purple face mottled.  "A crime!"
he cried hoarsely.  "I will go for the police!"

     The priest could hear him dragging down his palm-leaf hat from the peg
and tumbling out of the front door; he heard the garden gate slam.
But he only stood looking at Cray; and after a silence said quietly:

     "I shall not talk to you much; but I will tell you what
you want to know.  There is no curse on you.  The Temple of the Monkey
was either a coincidence or a part of the trick; the trick was
the trick of a white man.  There is only one weapon that will bring blood
with that mere feathery touch:  a razor held by a white man.
There is one way of making a common room full of invisible,
overpowering poison:  turning on the gas--the crime of a white man.
And there is only one kind of club that can be thrown out of a window,
turn in mid-air and come back to the window next to it:
the Australian boomerang.  You'll see some of them in the Major's study."

     With that he went outside and spoke for a moment to the doctor.
The moment after, Audrey Watson came rushing into the house and
fell on her knees beside Cray's chair.  He could not hear what they said
to each other; but their faces moved with amazement, not unhappiness.
The doctor and the priest walked slowly towards the garden gate.

     "I suppose the Major was in love with her, too," he said with a sigh;
and when the other nodded, observed:  "You were very generous, doctor.
You did a fine thing.  But what made you suspect?"

     "A very small thing," said Oman; "but it kept me restless in church
till I came back to see that all was well.  That book on his table
was a work on poisons; and was put down open at the place where it stated
that a certain Indian poison, though deadly and difficult to trace,
was particularly easily reversible by the use of the commonest emetics.
I suppose he read that at the last moment--"

     "And remembered that there were emetics in the cruet-stand,"
said Father Brown.  "Exactly.  He threw the cruet in the dustbin--
where I found it, along with other silver--for the sake of
a burglary blind.  But if you look at that pepper-pot I put on the table,
you'll see a small hole.  That's where Cray's bullet struck,
shaking up the pepper and making the criminal sneeze."

     There was a silence.  Then Dr Oman said grimly:  "The Major is
a long time looking for the police."

     "Or the police in looking for the Major?" said the priest.
"Well, good-bye."




XI. The Strange Crime of John Boulnois


MR CALHOUN KIDD was a very young gentleman with a very old face,
a face dried up with its own eagerness, framed in blue-black hair
and a black butterfly tie.  He was the emissary in England
of the colossal American daily called the Western Sun--
also humorously described as the "Rising Sunset".  This was in allusion
to a great journalistic declaration (attributed to Mr Kidd himself)
that "he guessed the sun would rise in the west yet, if American citizens
did a bit more hustling." Those, however, who mock American journalism
from the standpoint of somewhat mellower traditions forget
a certain paradox which partly redeems it.  For while the journalism
of the States permits a pantomimic vulgarity long past anything English,
it also shows a real excitement about the most earnest mental problems,
of which English papers are innocent, or rather incapable.
The Sun was full of the most solemn matters treated in the most
farcical way.  William James figured there as well as "Weary Willie,"
and pragmatists alternated with pugilists in the long procession
of its portraits.

     Thus, when a very unobtrusive Oxford man named John Boulnois
wrote in a very unreadable review called the Natural Philosophy Quarterly
a series of articles on alleged weak points in Darwinian evolution,
it fluttered no corner of the English papers; though Boulnois's theory
(which was that of a comparatively stationary universe visited occasionally
by convulsions of change) had some rather faddy fashionableness at Oxford,
and got so far as to be named "Catastrophism".  But many American papers
seized on the challenge as a great event; and the Sun threw
the shadow of Mr Boulnois quite gigantically across its pages.
By the paradox already noted, articles of valuable intelligence and
enthusiasm were presented with headlines apparently written
by an illiterate maniac, headlines such as "Darwin Chews Dirt;
Critic Boulnois says He Jumps the Shocks"--or "Keep Catastrophic,
says Thinker Boulnois." And Mr Calhoun Kidd, of the Western Sun,
was bidden to take his butterfly tie and lugubrious visage down to
the little house outside Oxford where Thinker Boulnois lived
in happy ignorance of such a title.

     That fated philosopher had consented, in a somewhat dazed manner,
to receive the interviewer, and had named the hour of nine that evening.
The last of a summer sunset clung about Cumnor and the low wooded hills;
the romantic Yankee was both doubtful of his road and inquisitive
about his surroundings; and seeing the door of a genuine feudal
old-country inn, The Champion Arms, standing open, he went in
to make inquiries.

     In the bar parlour he rang the bell, and had to wait
some little time for a reply to it.  The only other person present
was a lean man with close red hair and loose, horsey-looking clothes,
who was drinking very bad whisky, but smoking a very good cigar.
The whisky, of course, was the choice brand of The Champion Arms;
the cigar he had probably brought with him from London.
Nothing could be more different than his cynical negligence from
the dapper dryness of the young American; but something in his pencil
and open notebook, and perhaps in the expression of his alert blue eye,
caused Kidd to guess, correctly, that he was a brother journalist.

     "Could you do me the favour," asked Kidd, with the courtesy of
his nation, "of directing me to the Grey Cottage, where Mr Boulnois lives,
as I understand?"

     "It's a few yards down the road," said the red-haired man,
removing his cigar; "I shall be passing it myself in a minute,
but I'm going on to Pendragon Park to try and see the fun."

     "What is Pendragon Park?" asked Calhoun Kidd.

     "Sir Claude Champion's place--haven't you come down for that, too?"
asked the other pressman, looking up.  "You're a journalist, aren't you?"

     "I have come to see Mr Boulnois," said Kidd.

     "I've come to see Mrs Boulnois," replied the other.
"But I shan't catch her at home." And he laughed rather unpleasantly.

     "Are you interested in Catastrophism?" asked the wondering Yankee.

     "I'm interested in catastrophes; and there are going to be some,"
replied his companion gloomily.  "Mine's a filthy trade,
and I never pretend it isn't."

     With that he spat on the floor; yet somehow in the very act and
instant one could realize that the man had been brought up as a gentleman.

     The American pressman considered him with more attention.
His face was pale and dissipated, with the promise of formidable passions
yet to be loosed; but it was a clever and sensitive face; his clothes
were coarse and careless, but he had a good seal ring on one of his long,
thin fingers.  His name, which came out in the course of talk,
was James Dalroy; he was the son of a bankrupt Irish landlord,
and attached to a pink paper which he heartily despised, called
Smart Society, in the capacity of reporter and of something
painfully like a spy.

     Smart Society, I regret to say, felt none of that interest in
Boulnois on Darwin which was such a credit to the head and hearts of
the Western Sun.  Dalroy had come down, it seemed, to snuff up
the scent of a scandal which might very well end in the Divorce Court,
but which was at present hovering between Grey Cottage and Pendragon Park.

     Sir Claude Champion was known to the readers of the Western Sun
as well as Mr Boulnois.  So were the Pope and the Derby Winner;
but the idea of their intimate acquaintanceship would have struck Kidd
as equally incongruous.  He had heard of (and written about,
nay, falsely pretended to know) Sir Claude Champion, as
"one of the brightest and wealthiest of England's Upper Ten";
as the great sportsman who raced yachts round the world;
as the great traveller who wrote books about the Himalayas,
as the politician who swept constituencies with a startling sort of
Tory Democracy, and as the great dabbler in art, music, literature,
and, above all, acting.  Sir Claude was really rather magnificent in
other than American eyes.  There was something of the Renascence Prince
about his omnivorous culture and restless publicity--, he was not only
a great amateur, but an ardent one.  There was in him none of that
antiquarian frivolity that we convey by the word "dilettante".

     That faultless falcon profile with purple-black Italian eye,
which had been snap-shotted so often both for Smart Society and
the Western Sun, gave everyone the impression of a man eaten by ambition
as by a fire, or even a disease.  But though Kidd knew a great deal
about Sir Claude--a great deal more, in fact, than there was to know--
it would never have crossed his wildest dreams to connect so showy
an aristocrat with the newly-unearthed founder of Catastrophism,
or to guess that Sir Claude Champion and John Boulnois could be
intimate friends.  Such, according to Dalroy's account,
was nevertheless the fact.  The two had hunted in couples at school
and college, and, though their social destinies had been very different
(for Champion was a great landlord and almost a millionaire,
while Boulnois was a poor scholar and, until just lately,
an unknown one), they still kept in very close touch with each other.
Indeed, Boulnois's cottage stood just outside the gates of Pendragon Park.

     But whether the two men could be friends much longer was becoming
a dark and ugly question.  A year or two before, Boulnois had married
a beautiful and not unsuccessful actress, to whom he was devoted
in his own shy and ponderous style; and the proximity of the household
to Champion's had given that flighty celebrity opportunities for behaving
in a way that could not but cause painful and rather base excitement.
Sir Claude had carried the arts of publicity to perfection;
and he seemed to take a crazy pleasure in being equally ostentatious
in an intrigue that could do him no sort of honour.  Footmen from
Pendragon were perpetually leaving bouquets for Mrs Boulnois;
carriages and motor-cars were perpetually calling at the cottage
for Mrs Boulnois; balls and masquerades perpetually filled the grounds
in which the baronet paraded Mrs Boulnois, like the Queen of
Love and Beauty at a tournament.  That very evening, marked by Mr
Kidd for the exposition of Catastrophism, had been marked by
Sir Claude Champion for an open-air rendering of Romeo and Juliet,
in which he was to play Romeo to a Juliet it was needless to name.

     "I don't think it can go on without a smash," said the young man
with red hair, getting up and shaking himself.  "Old Boulnois may be
squared--or he may be square.  But if he's square he's thick--
what you might call cubic.  But I don't believe it's possible."

     "He is a man of grand intellectual powers," said Calhoun Kidd
in a deep voice.

     "Yes," answered Dalroy; "but even a man of grand intellectual powers
can't be such a blighted fool as all that.  Must you be going on?
I shall be following myself in a minute or two."

     But Calhoun Kidd, having finished a milk and soda, betook himself
smartly up the road towards the Grey Cottage, leaving his cynical informant
to his whisky and tobacco.  The last of the daylight had faded;
the skies were of a dark, green-grey, like slate, studded here and there
with a star, but lighter on the left side of the sky, with the promise
of a rising moon.

     The Grey Cottage, which stood entrenched, as it were, in a square
of stiff, high thorn-hedges, was so close under the pines and palisades
of the Park that Kidd at first mistook it for the Park Lodge.
Finding the name on the narrow wooden gate, however, and seeing
by his watch that the hour of the "Thinker's" appointment had just struck,
he went in and knocked at the front door.  Inside the garden hedge,
he could see that the house, though unpretentious enough, was larger
and more luxurious than it looked at first, and was quite a different kind
of place from a porter's lodge.  A dog-kennel and a beehive stood outside,
like symbols of old English country-life; the moon was rising behind
a plantation of prosperous pear trees, the dog that came out of the kennel
was reverend-looking and reluctant to bark; and the plain, elderly
man-servant who opened the door was brief but dignified.

     "Mr Boulnois asked me to offer his apologies, sir," he said,
"but he has been obliged to go out suddenly."

     "But see here, I had an appointment," said the interviewer,
with a rising voice.  "Do you know where he went to?"

     "To Pendragon Park, sir," said the servant, rather sombrely,
and began to close the door.

     Kidd started a little.

     "Did he go with Mrs--with the rest of the party?" he asked
rather vaguely.

     "No, sir," said the man shortly; "he stayed behind, and then
went out alone." And he shut the door, brutally, but with an air of
duty not done.

     The American, that curious compound of impudence and sensitiveness,
was annoyed.  He felt a strong desire to hustle them all along a bit
and teach them business habits; the hoary old dog and the grizzled,
heavy-faced old butler with his prehistoric shirt-front, and the drowsy
old moon, and above all the scatter-brained old philosopher who
couldn't keep an appointment.

     "If that's the way he goes on he deserves to lose his wife's
purest devotion," said Mr Calhoun Kidd.  "But perhaps he's gone over
to make a row.  In that case I reckon a man from the Western Sun
will be on the spot."

     And turning the corner by the open lodge-gates, he set off,
stumping up the long avenue of black pine-woods that pointed
in abrupt perspective towards the inner gardens of Pendragon Park.
The trees were as black and orderly as plumes upon a hearse;
there were still a few stars.  He was a man with more literary
than direct natural associations; the word "Ravenswood" came into
his head repeatedly.  It was partly the raven colour of the pine-woods;
but partly also an indescribable atmosphere almost described
in Scott's great tragedy; the smell of something that died
in the eighteenth century; the smell of dank gardens and broken urns,
of wrongs that will never now be righted; of something that is
none the less incurably sad because it is strangely unreal.

     More than once, as he went up that strange, black road
of tragic artifice, he stopped, startled, thinking he heard steps
in front of him.  He could see nothing in front but the twin sombre
walls of pine and the wedge of starlit sky above them.  At first
he thought he must have fancied it or been mocked by a mere echo of
his own tramp.  But as he went on he was more and more inclined
to conclude, with the remains of his reason, that there really were
other feet upon the road.  He thought hazily of ghosts; and was surprised
how swiftly he could see the image of an appropriate and local ghost,
one with a face as white as Pierrot's, but patched with black.
The apex of the triangle of dark-blue sky was growing brighter and bluer,
but he did not realize as yet that this was because he was coming
nearer to the lights of the great house and garden.  He only felt
that the atmosphere was growing more intense, there was in the sadness
more violence and secrecy--more--he hesitated for the word,
and then said it with a jerk of laughter--Catastrophism.

     More pines, more pathway slid past him, and then he stood rooted
as by a blast of magic.  It is vain to say that he felt as if he had
got into a dream; but this time he felt quite certain that he had
got into a book.  For we human beings are used to inappropriate things;
we are accustomed to the clatter of the incongruous; it is a tune
to which we can go to sleep.  If one appropriate thing happens,
it wakes us up like the pang of a perfect chord.  Something happened
such as would have happened in such a place in a forgotten tale.

     Over the black pine-wood came flying and flashing in the moon
a naked sword--such a slender and sparkling rapier as may have
fought many an unjust duel in that ancient park.  It fell on the pathway
far in front of him and lay there glistening like a large needle.
He ran like a hare and bent to look at it.  Seen at close quarters
it had rather a showy look:  the big red jewels in the hilt and guard
were a little dubious.  But there were other red drops upon the blade
which were not dubious.

     He looked round wildly in the direction from which the dazzling missile
had come, and saw that at this point the sable facade of fir and pine
was interrupted by a smaller road at right angles; which, when he turned it,
brought him in full view of the long, lighted house, with a lake and
fountains in front of it.  Nevertheless, he did not look at this,
having something more interesting to look at.

     Above him, at the angle of the steep green bank of the
terraced garden, was one of those small picturesque surprises
common in the old landscape gardening; a kind of small round hill or
dome of grass, like a giant mole-hill, ringed and crowned with
three concentric fences of roses, and having a sundial in the highest point
in the centre.  Kidd could see the finger of the dial stand up dark
against the sky like the dorsal fin of a shark and the vain moonlight
clinging to that idle clock.  But he saw something else clinging
to it also, for one wild moment--the figure of a man.

     Though he saw it there only for a moment, though it was outlandish
and incredible in costume, being clad from neck to heel in tight crimson,
with glints of gold, yet he knew in one flash of moonlight who it was.
That white face flung up to heaven, clean-shaven and so unnaturally young,
like Byron with a Roman nose, those black curls already grizzled--
he had seen the thousand public portraits of Sir Claude Champion.
The wild red figure reeled an instant against the sundial; the next
it had rolled down the steep bank and lay at the American's feet,
faintly moving one arm.  A gaudy, unnatural gold ornament on the arm
suddenly reminded Kidd of Romeo and Juliet; of course the tight crimson
suit was part of the play.  But there was a long red stain down
the bank from which the man had rolled--that was no part of the play.
He had been run through the body.

     Mr Calhoun Kidd shouted and shouted again.  Once more he seemed
to hear phantasmal footsteps, and started to find another figure
already near him.  He knew the figure, and yet it terrified him.
The dissipated youth who had called himself Dalroy had a horribly quiet
way with him; if Boulnois failed to keep appointments that had been made,
Dalroy had a sinister air of keeping appointments that hadn't.
The moonlight discoloured everything, against Dalroy's red hair
his wan face looked not so much white as pale green.

     All this morbid impressionism must be Kidd's excuse for having
cried out, brutally and beyond all reason:  "Did you do this, you devil?"

     James Dalroy smiled his unpleasing smile; but before he could speak,
the fallen figure made another movement of the arm, waving vaguely
towards the place where the sword fell; then came a moan, and then
it managed to speak.

     "Boulnois....  Boulnois, I say....  Boulnois did it...
jealous of me...he was jealous, he was, he was..."

     Kidd bent his head down to hear more, and just managed
to catch the words:

     "Boulnois...with my own sword...he threw it..."

     Again the failing hand waved towards the sword, and then fell rigid
with a thud.  In Kidd rose from its depth all that acrid humour
that is the strange salt of the seriousness of his race.

     "See here," he said sharply and with command, "you must
fetch a doctor.  This man's dead."

     "And a priest, too, I suppose," said Dalroy in an undecipherable manner.
"All these Champions are papists."

     The American knelt down by the body, felt the heart, propped up
the head and used some last efforts at restoration; but before
the other journalist reappeared, followed by a doctor and a priest,
he was already prepared to assert they were too late.

     "Were you too late also?" asked the doctor, a solid
prosperous-looking man, with conventional moustache and whiskers,
but a lively eye, which darted over Kidd dubiously.

     "In one sense," drawled the representative of the Sun.
"I was too late to save the man, but I guess I was in time to hear
something of importance.  I heard the dead man denounce his assassin."

     "And who was the assassin?" asked the doctor, drawing his
eyebrows together.

     "Boulnois," said Calhoun Kidd, and whistled softly.

     The doctor stared at him gloomily with a reddening brow--,
but he did not contradict.  Then the priest, a shorter figure
in the background, said mildly:  "I understood that Mr Boulnois
was not coming to Pendragon Park this evening."

     "There again," said the Yankee grimly, "I may be in a position
to give the old country a fact or two.  Yes, sir, John Boulnois
was going to stay in all this evening; he fixed up a real good appointment
there with me.  But John Boulnois changed his mind; John Boulnois
left his home abruptly and all alone, and came over to this darned Park
an hour or so ago.  His butler told me so.  I think we hold what
the all-wise police call a clue--have you sent for them?"

     "Yes," said the doctor, "but we haven't alarmed anyone else yet."

     "Does Mrs Boulnois know?" asked James Dalroy, and again Kidd
was conscious of an irrational desire to hit him on his curling mouth.

     "I have not told her," said the doctor gruffly--, "but here come
the police."

     The little priest had stepped out into the main avenue,
and now returned with the fallen sword, which looked ludicrously large
and theatrical when attached to his dumpy figure, at once clerical
and commonplace.  "Just before the police come," he said apologetically,
"has anyone got a light?"

     The Yankee journalist took an electric torch from his pocket,
and the priest held it close to the middle part of the blade,
which he examined with blinking care.  Then, without glancing at
the point or pommel, he handed the long weapon to the doctor.

     "I fear I'm no use here," he said, with a brief sigh.
"I'll say good night to you, gentlemen." And he walked away
up the dark avenue towards the house, his hands clasped behind him
and his big head bent in cogitation.

     The rest of the group made increased haste towards the lodge-gates,
where an inspector and two constables could already be seen
in consultation with the lodge-keeper.  But the little priest
only walked slower and slower in the dim cloister of pine, and at last
stopped dead, on the steps of the house.  It was his silent way
of acknowledging an equally silent approach; for there came towards
him a presence that might have satisfied even Calhoun Kidd's demands
for a lovely and aristocratic ghost.  It was a young woman
in silvery satins of a Renascence design; she had golden hair
in two long shining ropes, and a face so startingly pale between them
that she might have been chryselephantine--made, that is, like some
old Greek statues, out of ivory and gold.  But her eyes were very bright,
and her voice, though low, was confident.

     "Father Brown?" she said.

     "Mrs Boulnois?" he replied gravely.  Then he looked at her and
immediately said:  "I see you know about Sir Claude."

     "How do you know I know?" she asked steadily.

     He did not answer the question, but asked another:  "Have you
seen your husband?"

     "My husband is at home," she said.  "He has nothing to do with this."

     Again he did not answer; and the woman drew nearer to him,
with a curiously intense expression on her face.

     "Shall I tell you something more?" she said, with a rather
fearful smile.  "I don't think he did it, and you don't either."
Father Brown returned her gaze with a long, grave stare, and then nodded,
yet more gravely.

     "Father Brown," said the lady, "I am going to tell you all I know,
but I want you to do me a favour first.  Will you tell me why
you haven't jumped to the conclusion of poor John's guilt,
as all the rest have done?   Don't mind what you say:  I--I know about
the gossip and the appearances that are against me."

     Father Brown looked honestly embarrassed, and passed his hand
across his forehead.  "Two very little things," he said.
"At least, one's very trivial and the other very vague.
But such as they are, they don't fit in with Mr Boulnois
being the murderer."

     He turned his blank, round face up to the stars and
continued absentmindedly:  "To take the vague idea first.
I attach a good deal of importance to vague ideas.  All those things that
`aren't evidence' are what convince me.  I think a moral impossibility
the biggest of all impossibilities.  I know your husband only slightly,
but I think this crime of his, as generally conceived, something
very like a moral impossibility.  Please do not think I mean that
Boulnois could not be so wicked.  Anybody can be wicked--as wicked as
he chooses.  We can direct our moral wills; but we can't generally change
our instinctive tastes and ways of doing things.  Boulnois might
commit a murder, but not this murder.  He would not snatch Romeo's sword
from its romantic scabbard; or slay his foe on the sundial as on
a kind of altar; or leave his body among the roses, or fling the sword
away among the pines.  If Boulnois killed anyone he'd do it
quietly and heavily, as he'd do any other doubtful thing--
take a tenth glass of port, or read a loose Greek poet.
No, the romantic setting is not like Boulnois.  It's more like Champion."

     "Ah!" she said, and looked at him with eyes like diamonds.

     "And the trivial thing was this," said Brown.  "There were
finger-prints on that sword; finger-prints can be detected quite
a time after they are made if they're on some polished surface
like glass or steel.  These were on a polished surface.
They were half-way down the blade of the sword.  Whose prints they were
I have no earthly clue; but why should anybody hold a sword half-way down?
It was a long sword, but length is an advantage in lunging at an enemy.
At least, at most enemies.  At all enemies except one."

     "Except one," she repeated.

     "There is only one enemy," said Father Brown, "whom it is easier
to kill with a dagger than a sword."

     "I know," said the woman.  "Oneself."

     There was a long silence, and then the priest said quietly
but abruptly:  "Am I right, then?  Did Sir Claude kill himself?"

     "Yes" she said, with a face like marble.  "I saw him do it."

     "He died," said Father Brown, "for love of you?"

     An extraordinary expression flashed across her face,
very different from pity, modesty, remorse, or anything her companion
had expected:  her voice became suddenly strong and full.
"I don't believe," she said, "he ever cared about me a rap.
He hated my husband."

     "Why?" asked the other, and turned his round face from the sky
to the lady.

     "He hated my husband because...it is so strange I hardly know
how to say it...because..."

     "Yes?" said Brown patiently.

     "Because my husband wouldn't hate him."

     Father Brown only nodded, and seemed still to be listening;
he differed from most detectives in fact and fiction in a small point--
he never pretended not to understand when he understood perfectly well.

     Mrs Boulnois drew near once more with the same contained
glow of certainty.  "My husband," she said, "is a great man.
Sir Claude Champion was not a great man:  he was a celebrated and
successful man.  My husband has never been celebrated or successful;
and it is the solemn truth that he has never dreamed of being so.
He no more expects to be famous for thinking than for smoking cigars.
On all that side he has a sort of splendid stupidity.  He has never
grown up.  He still liked Champion exactly as he liked him at school;
he admired him as he would admire a conjuring trick done at
the dinner-table. But he couldn't be got to conceive the notion of
envying Champion.  And Champion wanted to be envied.  He went mad
and killed himself for that."

     "Yes," said Father Brown; "I think I begin to understand."

     "Oh, don't you see?" she cried; "the whole picture is made for that--
the place is planned for it.  Champion put John in a little house
at his very door, like a dependant--to make him feel a failure.
He never felt it.  He thinks no more about such things than--
than an absent-minded lion.  Champion would burst in on John's
shabbiest hours or homeliest meals with some dazzling present or
announcement or expedition that made it like the visit of Haroun Alraschid,
and John would accept or refuse amiably with one eye off, so to speak,
like one lazy schoolboy agreeing or disagreeing with another.
After five years of it John had not turned a hair; and Sir Claude Champion
was a monomaniac."

     "And Haman began to tell them," said Father Brown,
"of all the things wherein the king had honoured him; and he said:
`All these things profit me nothing while I see Mordecai the Jew
sitting in the gate.'"

     "The crisis came," Mrs Boulnois continued, "when I persuaded John
to let me take down some of his speculations and send them to a magazine.
They began to attract attention, especially in America, and one paper
wanted to interview him. When Champion (who was interviewed
nearly every day) heard of this late little crumb of success
falling to his unconscious rival, the last link snapped that held back
his devilish hatred. Then he began to lay that insane siege to my own
love and honour which has been the talk of the shire.  You will ask me
why I allowed such atrocious attentions.  I answer that I could not have
declined them except by explaining to my husband, and there are
some things the soul cannot do, as the body cannot fly.
Nobody could have explained to my husband.  Nobody could do it now.
If you said to him in so many words, `Champion is stealing your wife,'
he would think the joke a little vulgar:  that it could be anything
but a joke--that notion could find no crack in his great skull
to get in by.  Well, John was to come and see us act this evening,
but just as we were starting he said he wouldn't; he had got
an interesting book and a cigar.  I told this to Sir Claude,
and it was his death-blow.  The monomaniac suddenly saw despair.
He stabbed himself, crying out like a devil that Boulnois was slaying him;
he lies there in the garden dead of his own jealousy to produce jealousy,
and John is sitting in the dining-room reading a book."

     There was another silence, and then the little priest said:
"There is only one weak point, Mrs Boulnois, in all your
very vivid account.  Your husband is not sitting in the dining-room
reading a book.  That American reporter told me he had been to your house,
and your butler told him Mr Boulnois had gone to Pendragon Park after all."

     Her bright eyes widened to an almost electric glare;
and yet it seemed rather bewilderment than confusion or fear.
"Why, what can you mean?" she cried.  "All the servants were
out of the house, seeing the theatricals.  And we don't keep a butler,
thank goodness!"

     Father Brown started and spun half round like an absurd teetotum.
"What, what?" he cried seeming galvanized into sudden life.
"Look here--I say--can I make your husband hear if I go to the house?"

     "Oh, the servants will be back by now," she said, wondering.

     "Right, right!" rejoined the cleric energetically, and set off
scuttling up the path towards the Park gates.  He turned once to say:
"Better get hold of that Yankee, or `Crime of John Boulnois' will be
all over the Republic in large letters."

     "You don't understand," said Mrs Boulnois.  "He wouldn't mind.
I don't think he imagines that America really is a place."

     When Father Brown reached the house with the beehive and
the drowsy dog, a small and neat maid-servant showed him into
the dining-room, where Boulnois sat reading by a shaded lamp,
exactly as his wife described him.  A decanter of port and a wineglass
were at his elbow; and the instant the priest entered he noted
the long ash stand out unbroken on his cigar.

     "He has been here for half an hour at least," thought Father Brown.
In fact, he had the air of sitting where he had sat when his dinner
was cleared away.

     "Don't get up, Mr Boulnois," said the priest in his pleasant,
prosaic way.  "I shan't interrupt you a moment.  I fear I break in on
some of your scientific studies."

     "No," said Boulnois; "I was reading `The Bloody Thumb.'"
He said it with neither frown nor smile, and his visitor was conscious
of a certain deep and virile indifference in the man which his wife
had called greatness.  He laid down a gory yellow "shocker"
without even feeling its incongruity enough to comment on it humorously.
John Boulnois was a big, slow-moving man with a massive head,
partly grey and partly bald, and blunt, burly features.
He was in shabby and very old-fashioned evening-dress, with a narrow
triangular opening of shirt-front:  he had assumed it that evening
in his original purpose of going to see his wife act Juliet.

     "I won't keep you long from `The Bloody Thumb' or any other
catastrophic affairs," said Father Brown, smiling.  "I only came
to ask you about the crime you committed this evening."

     Boulnois looked at him steadily, but a red bar began to show
across his broad brow; and he seemed like one discovering embarrassment
for the first time.

     "I know it was a strange crime," assented Brown in a low voice.
"Stranger than murder perhaps--to you.  The little sins are sometimes
harder to confess than the big ones--but that's why it's so important
to confess them.  Your crime is committed by every fashionable hostess
six times a week:  and yet you find it sticks to your tongue like
a nameless atrocity."

     "It makes one feel," said the philosopher slowly, "such a
damned fool."

     "I know," assented the other, "but one often has to choose
between feeling a damned fool and being one."

     "I can't analyse myself well," went on Boulnois; "but sitting
in that chair with that story I was as happy as a schoolboy
on a half-holiday.  It was security, eternity--I can't convey it...
the cigars were within reach...the matches were within reach...
the Thumb had four more appearances to...it was not only a peace,
but a plenitude.  Then that bell rang, and I thought for one long,
mortal minute that I couldn't get out of that chair--literally,
physically, muscularly couldn't.  Then I did it like a man
lifting the world, because I knew all the servants were out.
I opened the front door, and there was a little man with his mouth open
to speak and his notebook open to write in.  I remembered the Yankee
interviewer I had forgotten.  His hair was parted in the middle,
and I tell you that murder--"

     "I understand," said Father Brown.  "I've seen him."

     "I didn't commit murder," continued the Catastrophist mildly,
"but only perjury.  I said I had gone across to Pendragon Park
and shut the door in his face.  That is my crime, Father Brown,
and I don't know what penance you would inflict for it."

     "I shan't inflict any penance," said the clerical gentleman,
collecting his heavy hat and umbrella with an air of some amusement;
"quite the contrary.  I came here specially to let you off the little
penance which would otherwise have followed your little offence."

     "And what," asked Boulnois, smiling, "is the little penance
I have so luckily been let off?"

     "Being hanged," said Father Brown.



XII. The Fairy Tale of Father Brown


THE picturesque city and state of Heiligwaldenstein was one of those
toy kingdoms of which certain parts of the German Empire still consist.
It had come under the Prussian hegemony quite late in history--
hardly fifty years before the fine summer day when Flambeau and
Father Brown found themselves sitting in its gardens and drinking its beer.
There had been not a little of war and wild justice there within
living memory, as soon will be shown.  But in merely looking at it
one could not dismiss that impression of childishness which is
the most charming side of Germany--those little pantomime,
paternal monarchies in which a king seems as domestic as a cook.
The German soldiers by the innumerable sentry-boxes looked strangely like
German toys, and the clean-cut battlements of the castle,
gilded by the sunshine, looked the more like the gilt gingerbread.
For it was brilliant weather.  The sky was as Prussian a blue as
Potsdam itself could require, but it was yet more like that lavish and
glowing use of the colour which a child extracts from a shilling paint-box.
Even the grey-ribbed trees looked young, for the pointed buds on them
were still pink, and in a pattern against the strong blue looked like
innumerable childish figures.

     Despite his prosaic appearance and generally practical walk of life,
Father Brown was not without a certain streak of romance in his composition,
though he generally kept his daydreams to himself, as many children do.
Amid the brisk, bright colours of such a day, and in the heraldic
framework of such a town, he did feel rather as if he had entered
a fairy tale.  He took a childish pleasure, as a younger brother might,
in the formidable sword-stick which Flambeau always flung as he walked,
and which now stood upright beside his tall mug of Munich.
Nay, in his sleepy irresponsibility, he even found himself eyeing the
knobbed and clumsy head of his own shabby umbrella, with some
faint memories of the ogre's club in a coloured toy-book.
But he never composed anything in the form of fiction, unless it be
the tale that follows:

     "I wonder," he said, "whether one would have real adventures
in a place like this, if one put oneself in the way?  It's a splendid
back-scene for them, but I always have a kind of feeling that they
would fight you with pasteboard sabres more than real, horrible swords."

     "You are mistaken," said his friend.  "In this place they
not only fight with swords, but kill without swords.  And there's
worse than that."

     "Why, what do you mean?" asked Father Brown.

     "Why," replied the other, "I should say this was the only place
in Europe where a man was ever shot without firearms."

     "Do you mean a bow and arrow?" asked Brown in some wonder.

     "I mean a bullet in the brain," replied Flambeau.
"Don't you know the story of the late Prince of this place?
It was one of the great police mysteries about twenty years ago.
You remember, of course, that this place was forcibly annexed
at the time of Bismarck's very earliest schemes of consolidation--
forcibly, that is, but not at all easily.  The empire (or what wanted
to be one) sent Prince Otto of Grossenmark to rule the place
in the Imperial interests.  We saw his portrait in the gallery there--
a handsome old gentleman if he'd had any hair or eyebrows,
and hadn't been wrinkled all over like a vulture; but he had
things to harass him, as I'll explain in a minute.  He was a soldier
of distinguished skill and success, but he didn't have altogether
an easy job with this little place.  He was defeated in several battles
by the celebrated Arnhold brothers--the three guerrilla patriots
to whom Swinburne wrote a poem, you remember:

        Wolves with the hair of the ermine,
          Crows that are crowned and kings--
        These things be many as vermin,
          Yet Three shall abide these things.

Or something of that kind.  Indeed, it is by no means certain
that the occupation would ever have been successful had not one of
the three brothers, Paul, despicably, but very decisively declined
to abide these things any longer, and, by surrendering all the secrets
of the insurrection, ensured its overthrow and his own ultimate promotion
to the post of chamberlain to Prince Otto.  After this, Ludwig,
the one genuine hero among Mr Swinburne's heroes, was killed,
sword in hand, in the capture of the city; and the third, Heinrich,
who, though not a traitor, had always been tame and even timid
compared with his active brothers, retired into something like a hermitage,
became converted to a Christian quietism which was almost Quakerish,
and never mixed with men except to give nearly all he had to the poor.
They tell me that not long ago he could still be seen about
the neighbourhood occasionally, a man in a black cloak, nearly blind,
with very wild, white hair, but a face of astonishing softness."

     "I know," said Father Brown.  "I saw him once."

     His friend looked at him in some surprise.  "I didn't know
you'd been here before," he said.  "Perhaps you know as much about it
as I do.  Anyhow, that's the story of the Arnholds, and he was
the last survivor of them.  Yes, and of all the men who played parts
in that drama."

     "You mean that the Prince, too, died long before?"

     "Died," repeated Flambeau, "and that's about as much as we can say.
You must understand that towards the end of his life he began
to have those tricks of the nerves not uncommon with tyrants.
He multiplied the ordinary daily and nightly guard round his castle
till there seemed to be more sentry-boxes than houses in the town,
and doubtful characters were shot without mercy.  He lived almost entirely
in a little room that was in the very centre of the enormous labyrinth
of all the other rooms, and even in this he erected another sort of
central cabin or cupboard, lined with steel, like a safe or a battleship.
Some say that under the floor of this again was a secret hole in the earth,
no more than large enough to hold him, so that, in his anxiety
to avoid the grave, he was willing to go into a place pretty much like it.
But he went further yet.  The populace had been supposed to be disarmed
ever since the suppression of the revolt, but Otto now insisted,
as governments very seldom insist, on an absolute and literal disarmament.
It was carried out, with extraordinary thoroughness and severity,
by very well-organized officials over a small and familiar area, and,
so far as human strength and science can be absolutely certain of anything,
Prince Otto was absolutely certain that nobody could introduce so much as
a toy pistol into Heiligwaldenstein."

     "Human science can never be quite certain of things like that,"
said Father Brown, still looking at the red budding of the branches
over his head, "if only because of the difficulty about definition
and connotation.  What is a weapon?  People have been murdered
with the mildest domestic comforts; certainly with tea-kettles,
probably with tea-cosies.  On the other hand, if you showed
an Ancient Briton a revolver, I doubt if he would know it was a weapon--
until it was fired into him, of course.  Perhaps somebody introduced
a firearm so new that it didn't even look like a firearm.
Perhaps it looked like a thimble or something.  Was the bullet
at all peculiar?"

     "Not that I ever heard of," answered Flambeau; "but my information
is fragmentary, and only comes from my old friend Grimm.
He was a very able detective in the German service, and he tried
to arrest me; I arrested him instead, and we had many interesting chats.
He was in charge here of the inquiry about Prince Otto, but I forgot
to ask him anything about the bullet.  According to Grimm,
what happened was this."  He paused a moment to drain the greater part
of his dark lager at a draught, and then resumed:

     "On the evening in question, it seems, the Prince was expected
to appear in one of the outer rooms, because he had to receive
certain visitors whom he really wished to meet.  They were geological
experts sent to investigate the old question of the alleged supply of gold
from the rocks round here, upon which (as it was said) the small city-state
had so long maintained its credit and been able to negotiate with
its neighbours even under the ceaseless bombardment of bigger armies.
Hitherto it had never been found by the most exacting inquiry
which could--"

     "Which could be quite certain of discovering a toy pistol,"
said Father Brown with a smile.  "But what about the brother who ratted?
Hadn't he anything to tell the Prince?"

     "He always asseverated that he did not know," replied Flambeau;
"that this was the one secret his brothers had not told him.
It is only right to say that it received some support from
fragmentary words--spoken by the great Ludwig in the hour of death,
when he looked at Heinrich but pointed at Paul, and said,
`You have not told him...' and was soon afterwards incapable of speech.
Anyhow, the deputation of distinguished geologists and mineralogists
from Paris and Berlin were there in the most magnificent and
appropriate dress, for there are no men who like wearing their decorations
so much as the men of science--as anybody knows who has ever been to
a soiree of the Royal Society.  It was a brilliant gathering,
but very late, and gradually the Chamberlain--you saw his portrait, too:
a man with black eyebrows, serious eyes, and a meaningless sort of
smile underneath--the Chamberlain, I say, discovered there was
everything there except the Prince himself.  He searched all the
outer salons; then, remembering the man's mad fits of fear,
hurried to the inmost chamber.  That also was empty, but the steel turret
or cabin erected in the middle of it took some time to open.
When it did open it was empty, too.  He went and looked into
the hole in the ground, which seemed deeper and somehow all the more
like a grave--that is his account, of course.  And even as he did so
he heard a burst of cries and tumult in the long rooms
and corridors without.

     "First it was a distant din and thrill of something unthinkable
on the horizon of the crowd, even beyond the castle.  Next it was
a wordless clamour startlingly close, and loud enough to be distinct
if each word had not killed the other.  Next came words
of a terrible clearness, coming nearer, and next one man,
rushing into the room and telling the news as briefly as such news is told.

     "Otto, Prince of Heiligwaldenstein and Grossenmark, was lying
in the dews of the darkening twilight in the woods beyond the castle,
with his arms flung out and his face flung up to the moon.
The blood still pulsed from his shattered temple and jaw,
but it was the only part of him that moved like a living thing.
He was clad in his full white and yellow uniform, as to receive his
guests within, except that the sash or scarf had been unbound and lay
rather crumpled by his side.  Before he could be lifted he was dead.
But, dead or alive, he was a riddle--he who had always hidden in
the inmost chamber out there in the wet woods, unarmed and alone."

     "Who found his body?" asked Father Brown.

     "Some girl attached to the Court named Hedwig von something or other,"
replied his friend, "who had been out in the wood picking wild flowers."

     "Had she picked any?" asked the priest, staring rather vacantly
at the veil of the branches above him.

     "Yes," replied Flambeau.  "I particularly remember that
the Chamberlain, or old Grimm or somebody, said how horrible it was,
when they came up at her call, to see a girl holding spring flowers
and bending over that--that bloody collapse.  However, the main point is
that before help arrived he was dead, and the news, of course,
had to be carried back to the castle.  The consternation it created was
something beyond even that natural in a Court at the fall of a potentate.
The foreign visitors, especially the mining experts, were in the wildest
doubt and excitement, as well as many important Prussian officials,
and it soon began to be clear that the scheme for finding the treasure
bulked much bigger in the business than people had supposed.
Experts and officials had been promised great prizes or
international advantages, and some even said that the Prince's
secret apartments and strong military protection were due less to fear
of the populace than to the pursuit of some private investigation of--"

     "Had the flowers got long stalks?" asked Father Brown.

     Flambeau stared at him.  "What an odd person you are!" he said.
"That's exactly what old Grimm said.  He said the ugliest part of it,
he thought--uglier than the blood and bullet--was that the flowers
were quite short, plucked close under the head."

     "Of course," said the priest, "when a grown up girl is really
picking flowers, she picks them with plenty of stalk.  If she just
pulled their heads off, as a child does, it looks as if--"
And he hesitated.

     "Well?" inquired the other.

     "Well, it looks rather as if she had snatched them nervously,
to make an excuse for being there after--well, after she was there."

     "I know what you're driving at," said Flambeau rather gloomily.
"But that and every other suspicion breaks down on the one point--
the want of a weapon.  He could have been killed, as you say,
with lots of other things--even with his own military sash;
but we have to explain not bow he was killed, but how he was shot.
And the fact is we can't.  They had the girl most ruthlessly searched;
for, to tell the truth, she was a little suspect, though the niece
and ward of the wicked old Chamberlain, Paul Arnhold.  But she was
very romantic, and was suspected of sympathy with the old revolutionary
enthusiasm in her family.  All the same, however romantic you are,
you can't imagine a big bullet into a man's jaw or brain without using
a gun or pistol.  And there was no pistol, though there were
two pistol shots.  I leave it to you, my friend."

     "How do you know there were two shots?" asked the little priest.

     "There was only one in his head," said his companion,
"but there was another bullet-hole in the sash."

     Father Brown's smooth brow became suddenly constricted.
"Was the other bullet found?" he demanded.

     Flambeau started a little.  "I don't think I remember," he said.

     "Hold on!  Hold on!  Hold on!" cried Brown, frowning more and more,
with a quite unusual concentration of curiosity.  "Don't think me rude.
Let me think this out for a moment."

     "All right," said Flambeau, laughing, and finished his beer.
A slight breeze stirred the budding trees and blew up into the sky
cloudlets of white and pink that seemed to make the sky bluer and
the whole coloured scene more quaint.  They might have been cherubs
flying home to the casements of a sort of celestial nursery.
The oldest tower of the castle, the Dragon Tower, stood up as grotesque
as the ale-mug, but as homely.  Only beyond the tower glimmered
the wood in which the man had lain dead.

     "What became of this Hedwig eventually?" asked the priest at last.

     "She is married to General Schwartz," said Flambeau.
"No doubt you've heard of his career, which was rather romantic.
He had distinguished himself even, before his exploits at Sadowa
and Gravelotte; in fact, he rose from the ranks, which is very unusual
even in the smallest of the German..."

     Father Brown sat up suddenly.

     "Rose from the ranks!" he cried, and made a mouth as if to whistle.
"Well, well, what a queer story!  What a queer way of killing a man;
but I suppose it was the only one possible.  But to think of hate
so patient--"

     "What do you mean?" demanded the other.  "In what way did they
kill the man?"

     "They killed him with the sash," said Brown carefully; and then,
as Flambeau protested:  "Yes, yes, I know about the bullet.
Perhaps I ought to say he died of having a sash.  I know it doesn't sound
like having a disease."

     "I suppose," said Flambeau, "that you've got some notion
in your head, but it won't easily get the bullet out of his.
As I explained before, he might easily have been strangled.
But he was shot.  By whom?  By what?"

     "He was shot by his own orders," said the priest.

     "You mean he committed suicide?"

     "I didn't say by his own wish," replied Father Brown.
"I said by his own orders."

     "Well, anyhow, what is your theory?"

     Father Brown laughed.  "I am only on my holiday," he said.
"I haven't got any theories.  Only this place reminds me of fairy stories,
and, if you like, I'll tell you a story."

     The little pink clouds, that looked rather like sweet-stuff,
had floated up to crown the turrets of the gilt gingerbread castle,
and the pink baby fingers of the budding trees seemed spreading and
stretching to reach them; the blue sky began to take a bright violet
of evening, when Father Brown suddenly spoke again:

     "It was on a dismal night, with rain still dropping from the trees
and dew already clustering, that Prince Otto of Grossenmark stepped
hurriedly out of a side door of the castle and walked swiftly
into the wood.  One of the innumerable sentries saluted him,
but he did not notice it.  He had no wish to be specially noticed himself.
He was glad when the great trees, grey and already greasy with rain,
swallowed him up like a swamp.  He had deliberately chosen
the least frequented side of his palace, but even that was more frequented
than he liked.  But there was no particular chance of officious
or diplomatic pursuit, for his exit had been a sudden impulse.
All the full-dressed diplomatists he left behind were unimportant.
He had realized suddenly that he could do without them.

     "His great passion was not the much nobler dread of death,
but the strange desire of gold.  For this legend of the gold he had
left Grossenmark and invaded Heiligwaldenstein.  For this and only this
he had bought the traitor and butchered the hero, for this he had
long questioned and cross-questioned the false Chamberlain,
until he had come to the conclusion that, touching his ignorance,
the renegade really told the truth.  For this he had, somewhat reluctantly,
paid and promised money on the chance of gaining the larger amount;
and for this he had stolen out of his palace like a thief in the rain,
for he had thought of another way to get the desire of his eyes,
and to get it cheap.

     "Away at the upper end of a rambling mountain path to which
he was making his way, among the pillared rocks along the ridge
that hangs above the town, stood the hermitage, hardly more than
a cavern fenced with thorn, in which the third of the great brethren
had long hidden himself from the world.  He, thought Prince Otto,
could have no real reason for refusing to give up the gold.
He had known its place for years, and made no effort to find it,
even before his new ascetic creed had cut him off from property
or pleasures.  True, he had been an enemy, but he now professed
a duty of having no enemies.  Some concession to his cause,
some appeal to his principles, would probably get the mere money secret
out of him.  Otto was no coward, in spite of his network of military
precautions, and, in any case, his avarice was stronger than his fears.
Nor was there much cause for fear.  Since he was certain there were
no private arms in the whole principality, he was a hundred times
more certain there were none in the Quaker's little hermitage on the hill,
where he lived on herbs, with two old rustic servants, and with
no other voice of man for year after year.  Prince Otto looked down
with something of a grim smile at the bright, square labyrinths
of the lamp-lit city below him.  For as far as the eye could see
there ran the rifles of his friends, and not one pinch of powder
for his enemies.  Rifles ranked so close even to that mountain path
that a cry from him would bring the soldiers rushing up the hill,
to say nothing of the fact that the wood and ridge were patrolled
at regular intervals; rifles so far away, in the dim woods,
dwarfed by distance, beyond the river, that an enemy could not
slink into the town by any detour.  And round the palace rifles
at the west door and the east door, at the north door and the south,
and all along the four facades linking them.  He was safe.

     "It was all the more clear when he had crested the ridge
and found how naked was the nest of his old enemy.  He found himself
on a small platform of rock, broken abruptly by the three corners
of precipice.  Behind was the black cave, masked with green thorn,
so low that it was hard to believe that a man could enter it.
In front was the fall of the cliffs and the vast but cloudy
vision of the valley.  On the small rock platform stood
an old bronze lectern or reading-stand, groaning under a great German Bible.
The bronze or copper of it had grown green with the eating airs
of that exalted place, and Otto had instantly the thought,
"Even if they had arms, they must be rusted by now." Moonrise had already
made a deathly dawn behind the crests and crags, and the rain had ceased.

     "Behind the lectern, and looking across the valley,
stood a very old man in a black robe that fell as straight as
the cliffs around him, but whose white hair and weak voice seemed alike
to waver in the wind.  He was evidently reading some daily lesson
as part of his religious exercises.  "They trust in their horses..."

     "`Sir,' said the Prince of Heiligwaldenstein, with quite unusual
courtesy, `I should like only one word with you.'

     "`...and in their chariots,' went on the old man weakly,
`but we will trust in the name of the Lord of Hosts....'
His last words were inaudible, but he closed the book reverently and,
being nearly blind, made a groping movement and gripped the reading-stand.
Instantly his two servants slipped out of the low-browed cavern
and supported him.  They wore dull-black gowns like his own,
but they had not the frosty silver on the hair, nor the frost-bitten
refinement of the features.  They were peasants, Croat or Magyar,
with broad, blunt visages and blinking eyes.  For the first time
something troubled the Prince, but his courage and diplomatic sense
stood firm.

     "`I fear we have not met,' he said, `since that awful cannonade
in which your poor brother died.'

     "`All my brothers died,' said the old man, still looking
across the valley.  Then, for one instant turning on Otto his drooping,
delicate features, and the wintry hair that seemed to drip
over his eyebrows like icicles, he added:  `You see, I am dead, too.'

     "`I hope you'll understand,' said the Prince, controlling himself
almost to a point of conciliation, `that I do not come here to haunt you,
as a mere ghost of those great quarrels.  We will not talk about
who was right or wrong in that, but at least there was one point
on which we were never wrong, because you were always right.
Whatever is to be said of the policy of your family, no one for one moment
imagines that you were moved by the mere gold; you have proved yourself
above the suspicion that...'

     "The old man in the black gown had hitherto continued to gaze at him
with watery blue eyes and a sort of weak wisdom in his face.
But when the word `gold' was said he held out his hand as if
in arrest of something, and turned away his face to the mountains.

     "`He has spoken of gold,' he said.  `He has spoken of
things not lawful.  Let him cease to speak.'

     "Otto had the vice of his Prussian type and tradition,
which is to regard success not as an incident but as a quality.
He conceived himself and his like as perpetually conquering peoples
who were perpetually being conquered.  Consequently, he was ill acquainted
with the emotion of surprise, and ill prepared for the next movement,
which startled and stiffened him.  He had opened his mouth
to answer the hermit, when the mouth was stopped and the voice
strangled by a strong, soft gag suddenly twisted round his head
like a tourniquet.  It was fully forty seconds before he even realized
that the two Hungarian servants had done it, and that they had done it
with his own military scarf.

     "The old man went again weakly to his great brazen-supported Bible,
turned over the leaves, with a patience that had something horrible
about it, till he came to the Epistle of St James, and then began to read:
`The tongue is a little member, but--'

     "Something in the very voice made the Prince turn suddenly
and plunge down the mountain-path he had climbed.  He was half-way towards
the gardens of the palace before he even tried to tear the strangling scarf
from his neck and jaws.  He tried again and again, and it was impossible;
the men who had knotted that gag knew the difference between
what a man can do with his hands in front of him and what he can do
with his hands behind his head.  His legs were free to leap like
an antelope on the mountains, his arms were free to use any gesture
or wave any signal, but he could not speak.  A dumb devil was in him.

     "He had come close to the woods that walled in the castle
before he had quite realized what his wordless state meant
and was meant to mean.  Once more he looked down grimly at the bright,
square labyrinths of the lamp-lit city below him, and he smiled no more.
He felt himself repeating the phrases of his former mood with
a murderous irony.  Far as the eye could see ran the rifles
of his friends, every one of whom would shoot him dead
if he could not answer the challenge.  Rifles were so near that
the wood and ridge could be patrolled at regular intervals;
therefore it was useless to hide in the wood till morning.
Rifles were ranked so far away that an enemy could not slink
into the town by any detour; therefore it was vain to return to the city
by any remote course.  A cry from him would bring his soldiers
rushing up the hill.  But from him no cry would come.

     "The moon had risen in strengthening silver, and the sky showed
in stripes of bright, nocturnal blue between the black stripes
of the pines about the castle.  Flowers of some wide and feathery sort--
for he had never noticed such things before--were at once luminous
and discoloured by the moonshine, and seemed indescribably fantastic
as they clustered, as if crawling about the roots of the trees.
Perhaps his reason had been suddenly unseated by the unnatural captivity
he carried with him, but in that wood he felt something
unfathomably German--the fairy tale.  He knew with half his mind
that he was drawing near to the castle of an ogre--he had forgotten
that he was the ogre.  He remembered asking his mother if bears lived
in the old park at home.  He stooped to pick a flower, as if it were
a charm against enchantment.  The stalk was stronger than he expected,
and broke with a slight snap.  Carefully trying to place it in his scarf,
he heard the halloo, `Who goes there?' Then he remembered the scarf
was not in its usual place.

     "He tried to scream and was silent.  The second challenge came;
and then a shot that shrieked as it came and then was stilled suddenly
by impact.  Otto of Grossenmark lay very peacefully among the fairy
trees, and would do no more harm either with gold or steel; only the
silver pencil of the moon would pick out and trace here and there the
intricate ornament of his uniform, or the old wrinkles on his brow.
May God have mercy on his soul.

     "The sentry who had fired, according to the strict orders
of the garrison, naturally ran forward to find some trace of his quarry.
He was a private named Schwartz, since not unknown in his profession,
and what he found was a bald man in uniform, but with his face
so bandaged by a kind of mask made of his own military scarf
that nothing but open, dead eyes could be seen, glittering stonily
in the moonlight.  The bullet had gone through the gag into the jaw;
that is why there was a shot-hole in the scarf, but only one shot.
Naturally, if not correctly, young Schwartz tore off the mysterious
silken mask and cast it on the grass; and then he saw whom he had slain.

     "We cannot be certain of the next phase.  But I incline to believe
that there was a fairy tale, after all, in that little wood,
horrible as was its occasion.  Whether the young lady named Hedwig
had any previous knowledge of the soldier she saved and eventually married,
or whether she came accidentally upon the accident and their intimacy
began that night, we shall probably never know.  But we can know,
I fancy, that this Hedwig was a heroine, and deserved to marry a man
who became something of a hero.  She did the bold and the wise thing.
She persuaded the sentry to go back to his post, in which place
there was nothing to connect him with the disaster; he was but one of
the most loyal and orderly of fifty such sentries within call.
She remained by the body and gave the alarm; and there was nothing
to connect her with the disaster either, since she had not got,
and could not have, any firearms.

     "Well," said Father Brown rising cheerfully "I hope they're happy."

     "Where are you going?" asked his friend.

     "I'm going to have another look at that portrait of the Chamberlain,
the Arnhold who betrayed his brethren," answered the priest.
"I wonder what part--I wonder if a man is less a traitor when he is
twice a traitor?"

     And he ruminated long before the portrait of a white-haired man
with black eyebrows and a pink, painted sort of smile that seemed
to contradict the black warning in his eyes.
